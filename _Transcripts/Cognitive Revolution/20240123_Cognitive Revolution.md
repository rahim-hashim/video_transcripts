# NYTimes vs OpenAI: Generative AI and the Law with Cecilia Ziniti, Founder and CEO of GC AI
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [January 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ql_FjOEYkgk)
*  the United States is strong intellectual property protection regime is what gave rise to Hollywood.
*  What gave rise to Silicon Valley? Oh, hey, I trained my own GPT on all your work and it's
*  been so helpful. And she's like, okay, thanks. Like, and it's sort of like, how am I supposed
*  to feel about that? Like it's maybe it's not verbatim copying and you know, who knows what
*  it outputs, but even if it rewords the phrases, should there be compensation for that? Of course,
*  in that process, they're going to defend and say, no, it's called the general purpose transformer.
*  The intended use of this device is like a VCR for your own personal use. My prediction is actually
*  that there ends up being a commercial solution to that, where there's some startup that's like,
*  Hey, GPT yourself. And then it's literally like, you can get her knowledge from there.
*  They're going to figure out AGI. They can figure out and not have infringement.
*  There's people that have said that they're using GPT 4.5 to actually do the copyright analysis.
*  Hello, and welcome to the cognitive revolution, where we interview visionary researchers,
*  entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.
*  Each week, we'll explore their revolutionary ideas. And together, we'll build a picture of
*  how AI technology will transform work, life and society in the coming years.
*  I'm Nathan Labenz, joined by my co-host, Eric Torenberg.
*  Hello, and welcome back to the cognitive revolution. My guest today is Cecilia Zanitti,
*  founder of GC AI, an AI assistant for in-house counsel, previously general counsel at Replet
*  and lead counsel on the Alexa team at Amazon, among other roles, and author of some of the most
*  helpful viral Twitter threads that I've read about the legal landscape surrounding generative AI
*  broadly, and about the potentially blockbuster New York Times versus open AI case in particular.
*  It's safe to say that legislators from the founders of the United States, who I learned
*  from Cecilia, did specifically provide for the protection of intellectual property in
*  the United States Constitution. To the more recent Congresses that have extended copyright
*  protections and otherwise modified intellectual property law, did not anticipate a technology
*  like generative AI when writing the rules that we live by today. And so it falls to the courts,
*  for now at least, to figure out how to apply an established legal paradigm to an emerging
*  technology paradigm. To be honest, aside from filing a couple of provisional patent applications
*  over the years, including one just last year, which I wrote with the help of GPT-4, this is
*  not an area that I've studied much at all myself. So I brought a ton of questions to Cecilia and
*  proceeded from the most general and basic to the most specific and nuanced. Why do we have intellectual
*  property in the first place? And what are its main branches? What legal frameworks apply to
*  generative AI? What rights do content owners have? Does the New York Times have a good case? Is it
*  really possible that the court could order GPT-4 to be destroyed as the New York Times demands?
*  How likely are the courts to rule on this question at all versus trying to force Congress to act?
*  Are there any notably good proposals for generative AI law that are not already broadly known?
*  And how will the U.S. position inform or perhaps be challenged by different choices that other
*  countries might make going forward? We cover all this and more in this conversation. As always,
*  if you're finding value in the show, we appreciate it when you share it with friends. This episode,
*  quite naturally, would be for the lawyers in your life. Now, I hope you enjoy this conversation
*  about the relationship between the law and generative AI technology with Cecilia Zaniti.
*  Cecilia Zaniti, technology lawyer and founder of GCAI at GetGCAI Online. Welcome to the Cognitive
*  Revolution. Thanks, Nathan. Glad to be here. I'm excited for the education that you are about to
*  share with me and with the audience. So many of us are AI enthusiasts, AI builders, AI researchers,
*  and we, of course, spend some time thinking about how is this going to impact the world? And
*  that often gets played out in very positive visions of the impact we want to make. And
*  certainly, there's the worries, too, of the risks that we want to avoid. I honestly haven't spent a
*  lot of time personally, and I suspect that's probably true for a lot of folks that listen
*  to the show, thinking about some of the kind of practical but super important interactions between
*  these new AI technologies and something like the law. And obviously, this has come to the fore
*  a bit recently with increasingly a ton of lawsuits being filed, the most notable of which
*  is the New York Times versus OpenAI, which has kind of got the counterparties to create a case that
*  seems like it could be a big precedent center and could be referenced in history books for
*  many years to come. I want to get into all this with you, but I would love to start, if you would
*  indulge us as people that are, at least speaking for myself, very much a beginner when it comes
*  to questions of the law by just asking for a kind of introduction to intellectual property law.
*  Why does it exist? What are the big sections of it? What are maybe some of the live issues?
*  And then we'll get into how AI enters the scene and how that changes things, perhaps. But a good
*  brief foundation, I think, would be super useful. Of course. So intellectual property law, you're
*  right to ask about it, because if you look at the rise of the big tech companies,
*  they're not big property holders. The property that they hold is intellectual. It's software.
*  It's marketing. It's brand. If you look at literally the Fortune 20 in 1980, there was not
*  a single tech company in there. And now I think it's four of the five with the Magnificent Seven or
*  whatever in the top. But in terms of the law, it's been long recognized that intellectual property
*  is important to encourage. It literally goes back to the Constitution. So not a lot of people know
*  this, but the Constitution in the article that created Congress, Article 1. So Article 1, Section
*  1, Clause 8 talks about to encourage or to promote the progress of science and the useful arts,
*  Congress shall allow for a limited time monopolies for authors and inventors. And so that's the IP
*  clause. And that literally gave rise to the Patent Office, the Trademark Office. And a lot of people
*  say that America's, the United States' strong intellectual property protection regime is what
*  gave rise to Hollywood, what gave rise to Silicon Valley. And so that's kind of the basis for it.
*  And then in terms of the types of intellectual property, we can dive in if you'd like.
*  Yeah. Okay, cool. I did not realize that it was that high up in the Constitution. So when I
*  think of this, at least three terms come to mind. Patents, which I understand to be kind of around
*  invention, copyrights, and trademarks. And I won't even venture to try to distinguish between those
*  final two. Are there any other classes that are missing? And how should I kind of conceptualize
*  those three buckets? Yeah, yeah. So trade secret is the other typical fourth category considered.
*  So the famous example is, of course, the formula for Coke that two people that know it can't fly
*  together. And it's very, very deeply protected. But essentially, those three buckets of patents,
*  trademarks, and copyrights, those are going to cover sort of most of what you think of software.
*  And when you think about AI and the production of LLMs. So we can dive into each of them. I think
*  they each have their own nuances. They each are created in slightly different ways and protected
*  in slightly different ways. Particularly, I always think about inputs and outputs for AI systems. And
*  I'm kind of interested also in what do you have to have or create to sort of be the input to then
*  have these rights? And then on the other end, like, what are the special rights that I have
*  in virtue of having these things? Yeah, yeah. So distinguishing again, the three types of IP,
*  and then we'll jump into copyright. Because I think that's where the New York Times suit is.
*  And that's where it'll get kind of juicy for your listeners. Patents are a pretty formal process.
*  So you actually apply for the right to exclude on an invention. And the patent itself has what's
*  called claims that lay out the steps for whatever it is. And it's very, it's called prosecuted,
*  but it's very heavily scrutinized at the time that you file. So you file for a patent on a given
*  technology. And then, you know, the patent office, you have some back and forth called office actions
*  that goes into that. But it's not, you don't kind of automatically get it. In contrast,
*  copyright literally attaches on creation. You don't have to do anything. Like you can literally
*  decide I want to write a poem about my kid, grab your pen, start writing, congrats, you have a
*  copyright. It's when it's actually in a fixed medium of expression in your head, not a copyright yet
*  in a fixed medium of expression, such as typed or written out, you likely have a copyright. Now,
*  if you just from memory were to write out the lyrics to Taylor Swift, you would not have a
*  copyright in that because she previously has a copyright in that particular expression of that
*  song. But if you were to rewrite, you know, a Taylor Swift song and instead make it about
*  potato chips, again, you're copyrighted. Very interesting. So on the patent side, just, this is
*  not pertinent so much to the main topic for today, but I guess for one thing, it's often common that
*  the patent system is broken. And we certainly, you know, hear stories, I don't know how really
*  common they are, or if this is like, you know, the dominant narrative or just sort of selective
*  storytelling, but you certainly hear this idea that the patent system is broken and, you know,
*  the big companies that have the resources to do it, they're going out and patenting all kinds of
*  things like very well in advance of actually being able to do it. And then they can sort of,
*  you know, squat on them or protect themselves or what have you. But like one thing that's very
*  striking about the current AI moment is Google invented the transformer and either they didn't
*  patent it or they patented in such a way that I guess I'm kind of embarrassed that I don't know
*  this, but everybody else is using it. Right. So could they have patented the transformer
*  and just chose not to or- So they could have patented the transformer model. So
*  software patents, a little bit of a debate. There was quite a reining back in of software patents
*  under a line of cases called Alice. But essentially you still can patent software
*  processes that have a specific result and that are embodied in a particular way.
*  According to Twitter, of course, my source for legal research, not really, but I did check
*  the transformer model was patented by Google. But for them enforcing it, it's kind of a losing
*  game for them to enforce it because they're the platform. They want everybody developing. And so
*  their patent strategy is much more defensive. So there were the patent wars, Google bought
*  Motorola and the smartphone patent wars. I built many hours of my life on those cases,
*  but essentially they're sort of like a detente reached. So little known fact, every Android
*  implementation, 10 bucks go to Microsoft. And most people don't know that, but literally every
*  Android phone, there are so many Microsoft operating system patents that the deal that
*  was reached was that that would be the case. So if you're a Samsung or any device, Android device
*  maker, it's actually a question whether you trigger this particular licensing fee. And it's a big deal
*  because it's an element of the bomb, the bill of materials for a piece of hardware. And so essentially
*  yes, could Google go after people for their huge, Google is one of the bigger patent filers and
*  patent holders, but in general, their strategy has not been to go after people. They use them
*  much more defensively. So for example, Sonos had a big series of patent cases against Google and
*  Google, of course, had a bunch of patents that it could assert against Sonos. So that litigation
*  went on for, I think it's been seven years, eight years. And if I'm Sonos, I don't know that it was
*  wise to sue Google in that scenario to your point that it's like, you know, the pockets are really
*  deep. The portfolio of patents that Google has is really wide. And so chances are even a great
*  result would be some kind of cross licensing. Yeah, interesting. So I mean, this would be,
*  if there was one moment, right, that would maybe challenge that detente, like this might be the
*  one, right? You could imagine a scenario where Google would say, Hey, yeah, you know, don't be
*  evil. All that stuff would kind of send me retired that anyway, but opening eye and Microsoft
*  have gotten ahead of us here in a way that we really can't allow. And it might like disrupt
*  search our core business and we own the patents on this. Let's go shut them down. If they were to do
*  that, it seems like they would have a chance of winning, right? It's complicated. So I mentioned
*  that the $10 that Google pays Microsoft, the amount of Microsoft patents that Google reads on
*  is potentially infinite, right? So every single Google service probably has, you know, a basic
*  file system, for example, and Microsoft's patents go super deep in file systems, but more it's the
*  PR thing, right? Can you imagine Google files a big patent suit against open AI talk about code
*  red. So code red was last year when chat GPT came out and everybody at Google freaked out and they
*  really, um, marshaled the company in this direction to move faster and then Bard and Gemini and so on
*  came out of that. But you know, if they, if they sue that, if I'm their strategist, so not just their
*  lawyer, but their strategist, I'm thinking, you know, the press on that would be, you know,
*  old line Google in its last throws tries a legal mechanic against open AI, right? So it wouldn't
*  play out great that way. Could they? Yeah. I mean, on the open AI side though, there's a concept in
*  your readers might find this super interesting. Um, you can design around a patent. So remember
*  I mentioned that there's the claims. So very specific step one, step two, step three to do this.
*  And if you, um, skip one of those steps or you do something a little different, you potentially
*  don't infringe and that infringement analysis, you know, that requires a court case itself.
*  So one fun story about Google, I actually worked at, um, my first job in a legal team was at Yahoo
*  in the early two thousands when they were still competing with Google, right? So Yahoo stock was
*  going up two bucks a month. I was very happy. I was able to pay for law school from that. Um,
*  and they were still competing in search. Um, so Chi Lu and some other really big industry luminaries
*  that eventually, um, you know, had Duke came out of Yahoo. Yahoo doesn't get great credit for its,
*  its tech, but it was good. But in any event, Yahoo bought a company called Overture,
*  which had literally come up with sponsored search and they had a patent on sponsored search,
*  which is literally the entire Google business model. And so there was a suit on that, that I,
*  that I was, um, you know, went to a couple of hearings for. And the issue was that the patent
*  as if you pull it up, you can Google it, not Yahoo, but you can Google it and find it.
*  The patent says it's, we have a patent on, or, you know, the claim, what is claimed. That's how the
*  patent reads. It's very formal. What is claimed is a system, a method wherein placement and search
*  is quote, determined using bid amounts. So determined using Google's defense was
*  we don't determine your placement and search using bid amounts only. We also look at relevance. We
*  also look at the name brand and they had all these things and basically said, no, no, no,
*  our algorithm is like way more complicated and interesting. It's not practicing this patent
*  because we determine it using a plurality of factors. So that was kind of the legal
*  thing. And that case settled, um, litigating on that point, really tough, right? We were
*  analogizing to GPAs, right? Okay. If the, if the valedictorian is determined using GPA,
*  but then if you play a sport, you win. Okay. Is that, is that infringing? So you get into these
*  really things that kind of almost match LLMs where each word matters. There's a whole process
*  in patent law called claim construction, where the parties basically agree on what the definition
*  of each specific word is that they're going to use, um, go forward. So yeah, patent law, you know,
*  similar to fair use under copyright law, which we'll get into is, um, you know, expensive and
*  unpredictable to litigate. That's the theme you're going to see in a lot of these kind of legal
*  solutions is that when a system is unclear or gray or based on the meaning of specific words,
*  it becomes more of a challenge to litigate and more of a risk.
*  Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors.

*  Yeah. Fascinating. Okay. So there's, there's the law and then there's the, you know, public
*  relations question. Then there's also kind of the game theory dynamics of like, if Google starts
*  suing Microsoft, Microsoft consume right back, you know, out a million different things as well.
*  And then everybody is kind of a mutual assured destruction. I don't know if this varies across
*  these different types of intellectual property, but to what degree, when, when I have a monopoly,
*  does that mean that basically I can, I have total rights to choose like who I deal with
*  and how there's, there's no, like, I guess it's not an interesting proposal the other day where
*  somebody said, you know, there should be like mandatory licensing where you can't, you know,
*  hold your invention totally exclusively, but you, you know, you might, should be able to profit
*  from it, but you can't like tell nobody else that they can ever use, you know, your good idea.
*  But as I understand it right now, you get to decide as the owner, right? Like will you,
*  you could just refuse outright. I just don't want to deal with these folks. And that's that.
*  Yeah. I mean, there are some kind of statutory exceptions in, in with respect to drugs. So there's
*  a whole regime around generic drugs and the amount of headstart that the original patent holder
*  gets and how they do that. Or, you know, sometimes, you know, the whole open source movement,
*  Google has open sourced a number of patents as have most of the big players. It gets back to that
*  constitution line, right? It says exclusive rights. So it's very similar to real property,
*  right? Like if you have this like plum piece of land, you know, next to the county fair,
*  you don't have to make it a parking lot. You can, you might make great money, but you don't have to.
*  Now there is a process called eminent domain where the government could potentially, you know,
*  come in, but that's really contra to, you know, the original constitution. Another kind of fun fact,
*  it was, you know, it's life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. The original text was life,
*  liberty and property. And so, you know, very serious thing and role that the government plays
*  in giving people, holders of both real and intellectual property, the right to really
*  capitalism. Like they can do it, they can not, they can do it badly, they can be selective.
*  Now there are some, you know, like the Civil Rights Act and so on about like serving people
*  at your restaurant. You know, there are rules on that. But in this case, like how, you know,
*  Google decides to commercialize or not the transformer model, you know, it's a strategy
*  question. And then they took one path, but seeing, you know, really open AI commercialize
*  it as they have and had just such a, such a breakout hit so quickly, you know, it sort of
*  indicates it, you know, what, what other gems is Google sitting on? I have the same curiosity as
*  you do. Interesting questions about like discovery too. And if you, my understanding is if this,
*  wherever we're to get litigated, then would the records become public and would like, is the,
*  is it the case that the only reason that we originally knew why Google or like how Google
*  was ranking its search results and all these different factors was because that came out in
*  discovery. I wonder what, you know, what Google might learn about what open AI has got up their
*  sleeves if they, if they got into a courtroom and everybody had to tell all their secrets.
*  Yeah. So, I mean, Google's definitely not a stranger to discovery and they, they've been under
*  definitely antitrust scrutiny for a number of years. And, you know, I've been in a house lawyer,
*  I was at Amazon for, for almost four years. And, you know, we train folks internally that really,
*  you know, the, the New York times test, literally what, you know, what you write,
*  would it, would it withstand the front page, both from a PR perspective and a legal one,
*  but in terms of actually the, you know, the litigation process, it's, you know, one of the
*  things that I think Metta actually got called out about in that I think it was Francis Hagan,
*  but there was like this whistleblower suit and a couple of years ago was, you know, they essentially
*  used Facebook internally, cool dog fooding, but anybody could sort of go into any, it would be
*  like open, completely public Slack channels and a company of that size, like there's a lot of info
*  you can have there. And they've since, you know, locked that down, but that's how that the, um,
*  Francis Hagan was able to actually pull down different, different research studies that she
*  eventually presented to Congress was because of this open system. So, you know, that being said,
*  I don't, you know, I'm pretty pragmatic about it in my, in my legal advice in-house in the sense that
*  information kind of wants to be free, you know, and I've been at companies where we had, you know,
*  almost completely public Slack channels and, you know, from an engineering standpoint too,
*  you can kind of scroll, you can get the history, you can understand. So, you know, there's definitely
*  a, that's the benefit that you're weighing against, you know, the risk of like, yeah,
*  if you get in a litigation, then it's like free for all. I mean, you see things, lots of fun
*  examples there. Um, all the big tech companies were sued by the California attorney general
*  over app stores. And some of the discovery there was like, don't ever give refunds. This is a great
*  revenue stream and kind of like just pretty bad statements internally that led to suits. So a lot
*  of it is also just communicating smartly. Very interesting. Okay. So let's then jump to the
*  copyright side. So you've said that as soon as I make something, I immediately have copyright in
*  it. This falls under the same exclusive situation, but yet I guess a couple of questions I have on
*  that one would be like, is this a commercial exclusion? You know, does it matter? Like if
*  I'm getting paid for, you know, using somebody else's copyrighted material and also like,
*  I feel like I see cover songs all the time that are like not necessarily, you know, signed off on,
*  but seem to happen. So give me a little bit more kind of a rundown on the copyright side of this.
*  You know, so your question on is copyright a commercial right? Is it a other kind of right?
*  People do look at it as a personal right. Um, so in France, it's actually called like a droï
*  morale or there's a French word, but essentially that as a creator, I have this kind of really
*  ethical right to exploit my work and to be the one to exploit it. But how you do that, um, the metaphor
*  that they teach in law school, which I think is a good one, is that an intellectual property right
*  is a bundle of sticks. So as an example for a movie, you can separately license the rights to
*  play the movie on the plane, the rights to play the movie on streaming, the rights to play the
*  movie on cable, the rights to play the movie overnight, like the rights to play the movie in
*  Italy, like whatever it is, there's infinitely many ways that you as the owner of that right can
*  decide to split it up. And you see that right? Like, you know, Netflix has a huge licensing
*  department that writes big checks. Your Hollywood studios have, they call it, I think they call it
*  business affairs, but legal and business affairs. But essentially that's the team that
*  thinks about how to split up these rights. And then there's merch and all kinds of downstream stuff.
*  So that's the right that the copyright holder has, but there are limits on that. And fair use is a
*  really important one. So fair use kind of interesting. It's not a defense. It's not like
*  you're infringing and then you claim fair use, although in practice, that's how it ends up
*  happening. Fair use is actually beyond the reach of the copyright. So the exclusive right in the
*  first place doesn't stop people from using your work in a way that is deemed fair use. Now,
*  how you decide that it's four factors, it's squishy, and we can get into it, but that's the other
*  important limit on copyright. Okay. I'm not sure I fully understand the distinction between
*  you're accused of violating copyright and then you defend yourself with this versus it doesn't
*  extend to that in the first place. But the reason it matters in practice is that you say it's not
*  infringement and it's kind of like, I guess it's a defense, but procedurally it's not like, oh,
*  I did it. I infringed your copyright. And then you get back, you get back to like, no, no,
*  it wasn't infringement because it was fair. And so the four factors, and by the way,
*  they're not exhaustive. The test literally says, may consider these factors and then
*  can consider others. So it's squishy and it's a balancing test. So whenever you have balancing
*  tests, it's like, oh, on the one hand, on the other hand, and it's kind of like, it's not like,
*  I don't know, provisions of the tax code where it's like X percent of your income, it's very,
*  it's relatively clear copyright is, is known as one of these areas. It's a little more gray.
*  And that kind of makes sense because it's creative expression. But in terms of the factors,
*  let me pull up, I want to, I want to make sure I'm precise for your folks. I'll pull up the
*  factors now, but it's basically the purpose and character of the use. So how is the alleged
*  infringer in this case, open AI using the work? Is it for profit? Is it transformative? There's
*  a bunch of sub questions under that. And that first factor is the one where there tends to be
*  the most play in technology cases. That's factor one. Factor two, the nature of the copyrighted
*  work. So is the work that is being infringed or allegedly being infringed, is it creative? Is it
*  the kind of thing that copyright wants to encourage and society wants to encourage?
*  New York Times here, they would say, yes, of course it is. You know, we've got news articles
*  going back to 1851. We've got news articles that literally we discover things that lead to criminal
*  prosecution. We've got 50 to a hundred million readers a week on our work. It's very creative.
*  This is the type of work that copyright wants to protect. So that's that second factor. You probably
*  have a situation where open AI would most likely admit that. It's not like the New York Times is a
*  phone book, which is the one case that found that, okay, phone books are not super creative. There's
*  only so many ways to list phone numbers and names. It's might be copying that as a commercial problem,
*  but it's not a copyright problem. And then amount and substantiality of the portion used is factor
*  three. So how that plays out is do you need to use the whole work or can you use bits and pieces
*  of it? Usually this plays out in like critical work or in sampling cases, or, you know, if you
*  are doing a critique, do you need to show a whole movie? No, you can just show clips of it and do
*  your critique. So that's that factor. And then finally, and this one is going to be important
*  in this case, the money, the effect of how the infringer uses the work on the market and value
*  of the original. So if it's a one-to-one substitute, in other words, people use ChatDBT
*  and they cancel their New York Times subscriptions because they can get full articles,
*  that's much less likely to be fair versus if it's a complimentary use or if it's not going to affect
*  the ability of that original rights holder to do what they want with their bundle of sticks.
*  Makes sense? Yes, although I'm not necessarily ready to judge the case.
*  If you want in the show notes, I can also give you like a fair use cheat sheet or something like
*  that. I don't know if people would like that. There's also a, might actually be helpful for
*  folks, the Library of Congress maintains a database of fair use cases and they've organized it really
*  nicely. They've put in summaries so you can literally look things up, you know, tech case
*  that found fair use or tech case that didn't. And the Copyright Office tries to give, you know,
*  again, encouraging authors to be creative, gives a lot of guidance on fair use that you can check.
*  These sound like great resources. Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word

*  What would you say have been the most recent wave of battles between, let's say, technology and other
*  constituencies, rights holders across society just prior to the current wave of AI stuff? Where have
*  the fault lines or the battle lines been drawn just before now?
*  Big technology shifts tend to have lawsuits that go with them. Part of the reason for that is that
*  you really see money moving. I talked about when I was at Yahoo, and at the time, online advertising
*  was still pretty new. The share of wallet of a given advertiser, let's say General Motors or
*  Ford advertising cars, they were still doing it in print media and TV. Now, that has shifted.
*  When you see shifts like that, it's like, okay, who's losing money? They're probably going to sue.
*  Who's making money? They're probably going to get sued. This OpenAI suit is a pretty classic example
*  in that paradigm. Others, so I was involved in the Apple Samsung case, and basically,
*  Apple came out with the iPhone. It was such a step function leap from the flip phones and,
*  I guess, dumb phones. But in any event, the ability to actually scroll on your screen and
*  access the web in this intuitive way, Samsung very quickly came out with their own version,
*  and that was a big IP suit. That's what I would look for in terms of the trends.
*  Now, the legal mechanics of how it happens tend to differ. Digital music is another great example,
*  also involving Apple, the scraping cases and the internet at large. Google's trademark lawsuits
*  are also another great example. It was not a settled question of law for a long time whether
*  if you search for Acme, Acme's competitors could buy that keyword. For a while, there were a bunch
*  of lawsuits about that. Google won them all, and basically, now that's a pretty settled area of law.
*  Essentially, Google's argument was like, well, we're presenting information. It's a different
*  kind of use. The other fun factor is that judges really like using Google. I really like using
*  Google. As a lawyer, it's one of the best tools. Based on that, my view, and this is, I guess,
*  a little bit more in the political economy space, is when judges like a technology, they kind of
*  find a way to rule for you. The market finds a way. I'm pretty optimistic in that sense.
*  There's always this... I find this fascinating, and I'm, as you can tell, very novice in all of
*  these different aspects. But I do find the question of, is the law really the law, or is it
*  sort of like this meta situation of figuring out how we want to interpret the law to do what we
*  want to do? I think that's always a really interesting question. You mentioned scraping.
*  That's starting to get pretty close to the current question. My understanding is that if
*  stuff's out there on the web, you're broadly allowed to scrape it to a first approximation.
*  LinkedIn lost some cases, I understand, against folks who were scraping LinkedIn profiles and
*  whatnot. Yeah. This gets to copyright, and commercial rights are kind of different.
*  So LinkedIn has in their toss, presumably, that you can't scrape by automated means in such a way
*  that it takes down their site, right? And it would be a violation of the toss. That being said,
*  we do have this case law around use for reverse engineering is okay, and then facts themselves
*  are not copyrightable. So that great telephone book case I mentioned, it was Feist versus
*  Royal Telephone, went all the way to the Supreme Court. And the copier one in that situation said,
*  okay, there may be other things, but in this scenario, copyright was meant to promote
*  creativity. And it's not meant to promote labor, just the work of putting together a phone book.
*  It's meant to promote the creativity. And so that's the line of cases that LinkedIn was able to,
*  or effectively lost on. But there's other ways now, right? Like how you calibrate the scraping,
*  if you're actually going around a paywall, and one of New York Times' arguments here is that they
*  very carefully calibrate where to put the paywall. Maybe you get a guest article, you get a certain
*  number. Maybe if you click from Instagram, you get the article for free. But then if you try to
*  reshare it, and that's their right. This is really a property right. Getting back to that
*  carnival parking lot example, I can decide to just have my parking lot open on Sundays,
*  and that would be my right. And here, the property holder in New York Times says,
*  I get to decide where people and how people see my content. And so that's how it kind of relates.
*  In the scraping case of LinkedIn, the fact that my name is Cecilia Zanitti, and my title is founder
*  and CEO of GCAI, that's just a fact. And so even if somebody discovered that through LinkedIn,
*  there would not be, LinkedIn would not have a claim on that.
*  Then maybe let's start to try to separate some of the possible issues of what's going on with the
*  New York Times and OpenAI, because I could see different kinds of complaints that the New York
*  Times might have. A few that come to mind are, one, you took all of our stuff and loaded it in with
*  a bunch of other stuff and trained your models on it. And we may or may not like that. Two would be,
*  we've seen these examples of CHPT like outputting very close to verbatim, essentially plagiarizing
*  an article. I guess I don't know if it would count as plagiarizing if it has been
*  effectively attributed to the New York Times, which I'm not actually immediately sure whether
*  those examples did say this is like a New York Times article or not. But in any event, it was
*  able to essentially have memorized and, as OpenAI has called it, regurgitate the full text
*  verbatim or very nearly verbatim. So they might not like that. And then I guess the third one would
*  be they now have these browsing capabilities where chat GPT can go out and access stuff on my behalf
*  and pull it back. And so now we kind of have Google-like questions of like, or maybe even
*  Facebook-like questions of, well, what's the right way to do that? Should they be able to show the
*  whole article? Should they be able to just summarize the article? Should they be able to
*  give you the headline only and like out to it? So is that a good organizing framework for the
*  issues here? And am I missing any? And which ones are really kind of the core ones that are
*  at issue? Yeah, no, you separated it perfectly. And in fact, that's both how the law and OpenAI
*  and people have been thinking about it. So the immediate, one of the reasons the New York Times
*  case I thought is stronger than others is that regurgitation issue. So they hired somebody to go
*  and look and get these verbatim articles and they have a deep enough library that they got it. So
*  that one is much more clearly infringement because if you look at the factors, it's like, OK,
*  you're using a whole, you're a possible substitute. It's really taking away that control
*  from the copyright owner. And it's not really transformative in the sense that somebody wanted
*  the original article. They could go to New York Times or they could in this as shown on that
*  thing, they could go to OpenAI. So that's kind of this regurgitation issue. And OpenAI has categorized
*  it as a bug, a singular bug. Now, I don't know, I'm not an engineer, but that seems a little
*  weird to me. But in any event, they're trying to show it's an isolated thing that they are fixing.
*  I would expect in discovery them to come out and defend on that. But that issue per OpenAI,
*  and then I think you could say reading the complaint, it's not really the core issue,
*  the core issue of training. The one that I think the reason this case has caught so much attention
*  and I think could be a watershed is really the training. Like I talk with a creator over the
*  weekend. They've got a podcast and they're sort of like a relatively famous creator.
*  And they said that somebody they've had three or four people email them and say,
*  oh, hey, I trained my own GPT on all your work and it's been so helpful. And she's like,
*  okay, thanks. And it's sort of like, how am I supposed to feel about that? Maybe it's not
*  verbatim copying and who knows what it outputs. But even if it rewords the phrases, if it's the
*  business advice that this person would give, should there be compensation for that? And that's its own
*  question. And copyright law is not a it's not a perfect fit because of what I said. But the four
*  factors you can figure out how you might, you know, it'll be fascinating to see how New York
*  Times and other creators argue it. But I do think you mentioned the idea of music covers.
*  The music industry is actually a great analogy here because there's a very clear and robust
*  system for how you license music. So Weird Al, who does like funny things like songs where he takes
*  very popular songs and makes them about potatoes or something, he actually licenses all his music
*  because he's like, I don't want to mess around. I'll just pay. I know it'll be a good work. I'll
*  just pay the original. And that's what he does. So, you know, that gives you evidence of somebody,
*  very, a very sophisticated creator electing to pay because there's a very clear system.
*  So that was also the benefit of iTunes. iTunes came out and it was like, okay, we knew that
*  Napster sort of felt, and I was talking with Jason Calacanis last week and he's like, it felt like
*  stealing. It was clear. It felt that way to me. And that's where you get that balancing and those
*  kind of like public good concerns here. It doesn't quite have the same feeling as Napster, but it
*  doesn't quite feel like iTunes either. Maybe an iTunes will emerge where my friend, the creator
*  or somebody creates a GPT of all her work and it's helpful to them. You know, should she get
*  paid in some way? Should there be some kind of Google result where it's like, you can do this?
*  You know, maybe. And I think that that could be what emerges.
*  Yeah, fascinating. Okay. So it's safe to say the law is not, it was not written with any anticipation
*  of these new technologies. And, you know, maybe in a few minutes, we can kind of turn toward like
*  what the law should be or, you know, there's always the possibility that, you know, Congress
*  could do something. But for now, like going back to one of the fair use defense, the main one here,
*  as I understand it, is just the transformative nature of the activity, right? So, and it's funny,
*  like the resonance, I don't think this was planned either, but the transformer being the
*  architecture that is, you know, commonly in use. Exactly. Names matter, right? I mean, think of
*  Uber's god mode and, you know, the privacy folks got really upset about that. And when I advise
*  engineering teams internally, you know, people are like, oh, we're going to come up with a product
*  called Eye of Sauron. I'm like, let's not put that in the code. It's like what I advise. So yeah,
*  these kind of, you know, terminology and advocacy, like the fact that it's called transformer is kind
*  of a nice fact. 100% agree with you. So it seems like it is, you know, to say that
*  this is a transformative use. On the face of it seems pretty clear to me aside from, I mean,
*  there is this regurgitation issue, which, you know, I certainly don't think that's like how
*  most people are using JetGPT is to like try to get it to spit out old New York Times articles.
*  So it does seem like there's a pretty just, you know, man on the street, hey, we took all this
*  text and we made this artifact out of it. And this artifact can do that. Would you call that
*  transformative? I would say like, you know, the vast majority of people would be like, yeah, that's
*  clearly transformative. Somebody will dispute everything. So who is disputing that? And how
*  are they disputing that? So that's all, that's all right. And the legal analysis, you know,
*  you're half a lawyer already just having explained that that way. So good job. But, you know, I think
*  what's the fair use analysis it looks at, is there a new purpose, meaning or message in the thing? So
*  classically, you know, a critical article of a movie, I'm Roger Ebert and I'm writing a critique
*  of a movie and I have a couple of lines. You know, that's clearly a different purpose you're
*  reading to evaluate the movie, different really meaning and different message. So Roger Ebert is
*  good in terms of GPT and it being a different, different way to use the work. That's obviously,
*  that's going to be a huge percentage of their case is, is really pushing on that and how it's
*  different. Where New York Times would potentially have holes in that is okay, but you have to
*  implement measures to where it won't be a substitute. And this is where OpenAI will say and has said in
*  their response in the blog post that, you know, we're working on fixing this bug, the regurgitation
*  bug. I would be curious to see stats on it. We have different content measures that prevent users
*  from asking for the copies. So this is the equivalent. Like if you go to Kinko's with
*  something, you actually sign a piece of paper or you click in their online interface that you have
*  rights to copy whatever it is. And, you know, there are cases on that and OpenAI would say every
*  single user signs our terms of use, our terms of use say that if you do a bunch of fancy prompting
*  to get regurgitation, that's a violation. And they would both have to have a terms of use protection,
*  but then they would also have to have technical ones, right? So Napster never actually got the
*  copies of the music, but they knew that that's what was going on. They knew that copyrighted music was
*  most of the file sharing. It wasn't sharing, you know, open source notes or anything like that.
*  It was really, if you looked at a Napster server at, you know, University of Illinois in 1999,
*  it was all, you know, sound garden or whatever, like musicians from their Metallica as the case
*  may be, right? And so that kind of knowledge of potentially contributory infringement or other
*  kinds of infringement is like, what is the technology provider doing? Now you could end
*  up with a congressional solution. So the DMCA, the Digital Melanum Copyright Act,
*  it was posted to deal with the fact that like, if I can post pictures online, which of course I can,
*  you know, early sites like GeoCity, Shutterfly, whatever, I can actually put up pictures and they
*  are potentially infringing. DMCA says, okay, you're the photographer, send a note to Shutterfly,
*  get it taken down. Send a note to GeoCity, get it taken down. And there's a whole kind of process
*  for that. We don't have that yet for LLMs. And so you might expect that something like that would
*  emerge for it to be fair, for it to truly, for OpenAI to truly be able to say like, we're not,
*  you know, copyright infringements are our intent. We're not intending to be a substitute. If you're
*  a rights holder, you can do X, Y, Z things to get your content either pulled out or some kind of
*  compensation system like the music folks, that that's going to be where the play is. But of course,
*  in that process, they're going to defend and say, no, it's called the general purpose transformer
*  that intended use of this device is like a VCR for your own personal use. So that's how they would
*  they would go on that. So is there any in between right now, like, you know, for example, the
*  emergence of Spotify, we now have these deals and I guess they could always make a commercial
*  deal between them, right? Like the New York Times and OpenAI could say privately, here's our deal,
*  we'll pay you X, you'll not give us a hard time anymore. But if they don't want a deal,
*  is there anything between OpenAI winning and it being like, yep, this is fair, you're cool.
*  Or on the other end, like it's not. And I guess the downstream question would be like, then what
*  happens because they've made some pretty, you know, aggressive demands around like the destruction of
*  of models, right? I mean, so is there any other legal in between?
*  Yeah, so the law is actually relatively adaptable in that sense. So as you mentioned,
*  New York Times had different claims. So different counts of the lawsuit of like you did this,
*  you did this, you did this. That is typically kind of like bifurcated and analyzed directly.
*  And then, you know, it will take time. But, you know, it's very common for one issue to go up to
*  a higher court. And then that court is called remand, but basically send it back down to look
*  at the specific facts. So procedurally, can it can the law handle these sort of shades of gray
*  and different accusations? Yes, it can. In terms of what will happen, and is there a possible middle
*  ground? Yes, I think there absolutely is. Like you could have a scenario where the rule comes out
*  saying, okay, regurgitation infringement for a use to be fair, the model provider has to take
*  reasonable measures to prevent regurgitation, something like that. And then the question becomes,
*  okay, what's reasonable? Do you is there some kind of industry standard that emerges? So that's one.
*  Another way it could go is, you know, they could absolutely settle, they could have damages going
*  backwards. So GPT 3.5, which I think was a little bit worse on regurgitation than GPT 4. You know,
*  it could be like, you know, that model, we get some kind of royalty for that. Or, you know, there
*  could be infinitely many solutions, just like there's like, you remember the bundle of sticks
*  I talked about, like, it's a really helpful framework to think about, like, okay, where do
*  we put the line? How many sticks does New York Times gets to keep? And which ones are they going
*  to rent out? Which one are they going to pay for? Well, what's hard about this is that, you know,
*  we know, and we I think a lot of us in technology believe that generative AI is absolutely going
*  to be incredibly lucrative, trillion dollars, you know, I think BCG says it's like a trillion
*  dollars of productivity is coming. That being the case, any deal you do now, are you kind of like
*  selling the baby because it New York Times wouldn't get the eventual value. But, you know,
*  interesting, interesting questions that I don't have an answer, but I do think a middle ground
*  is very possible. I disagree with some commentators that are like, Oh, it's the end of opening. No,
*  like that cats out of the bag, that would be very unlikely to get any kind of full injunction at
*  this point. So but there isn't anything that's like, you can do this, but you have to pay that
*  would be between the parties. Yeah, I mean, the concept injunctions themselves are also
*  considering four factors. And one of the factors is, is it a harm to whoever seeking the injunction
*  that cannot be solved with money? And if you think about it, there's actually very few things that
*  can't be solved with money. And so what ends up happening is, is, as you said, is that it's a
*  private agreement. The court, it's typically unlikely. I mean, sometimes you might get fines,
*  copyright does have statutory damages. So in the case of Napster, the record companies did go after
*  individual people. There's a woman, Jami Thomas, lady in Minnesota, that had, you know, I think she
*  had 80 songs or something. And at the time, the statutory damages were like, I think they were
*  15 K or something, they go up in relation. But anyways, she ended up having to pay $400,000.
*  She's just like a regular lady. And so like that was the record industry saying, no, no,
*  we're going to get our specific damages per work. And so you could get something like that. I think
*  it's unlikely. Also, OpenAI has said they will indemnify. So unlike Napster, which in that case,
*  didn't indemnify this woman, OpenAI has said they would. And so, you know, I think this is,
*  gets it more in the kind of Clash of Titans scenario that you, that you mentioned at the beginning.
*  Yeah, okay. So I guess another question is, what are the damages? I mean, it seems very unlikely.
*  This is something my wife who is a lawyer has trained me to think about, you know, anytime
*  somebody's like, we're gonna sue him. She's always like, well, are there really any damages? And a
*  lot of times there's not. This seems like like it's very hard for me to imagine that they're
*  going to be able to produce a ton of people who are like, yeah, I canceled my New York Times
*  subscription because I now have CHPT. You know, it's like, they're pretty different products. And
*  I really don't think many people are doing this regurgitation thing. So it seems like it's more
*  of like a principled thing, right? Like if I'm reading the two sides and I'm trying to, to infer
*  what they really care about, it seems to me that OpenAI probably wants to set a precedent that
*  what they're doing is allowed and fine. And they want to put this to bed once and for all. And this
*  is like a good chance to do that. And then on the New York Times site, it's a little bit harder for
*  me to say, but it almost seems like they want to like, it seems like they want like Congress to
*  act like it doesn't seem like they really are going to win in the courts. They might need like
*  Congress to say, Hey, we need a new regime here entirely because this training thing is like,
*  it is transformative, but we can't necessarily have everybody's stuff, you know, sucked up and
*  transformed with no compensation. Yeah. I mean, a congressional solution is very possible. And this
*  kind of strategic, you know, litigating with that in mind is very, I would say New York Times is
*  likely doing that. New York Times has also lost at the Supreme Court before on copyright. And so,
*  you know, they have that history as well. But in terms of like the damages and is it the principle
*  of it? You know, sure, like there's definitely a principle involved here, but that's actually
*  something that the law is pretty good, pretty good at handling, right? It's literally saying like,
*  weigh the public good. Like, what is this? Will New York Times or future journalists, future creators
*  continue to create works if they know that they're not going to be compensated and that they'll train
*  LLMs? You know, that's the kind of thing that I expect the court would consider certainly at
*  the highest levels. In terms of the damages, I mean, you do, if I'm a lawyer for New York Times,
*  you know, they got good lawyers. They can find people, you know, I'm seeing Andrew Chen,
*  who I love, Andreessen Horowitz investor. He posted a long and viral-ish tweet thread about
*  how he uses GPT only for news. And so, you know, that's one example, but it's the kind of thing that
*  it doesn't take a huge mental leap to think like, I have chat GPT open as a window all the time,
*  right? So this is a tech shift, right? And so like, when these behaviors change, you know,
*  who, and you play musical chairs or whatever, who's holding the bag or mixing metaphors.
*  But anyways, I need, I need there are no times to fix my metaphors. But anyways, you know,
*  you can see why they're doing it does come down to money too. Of course, my favorite
*  quote about copyright was law school, we had the attorney for, it was like a big rapper. I don't
*  remember if it's like P Diddy or Beyonce, somebody as a guest speaker. And they said, you know,
*  the question was, how does copyright come into play in your work? And he just like totally
*  deadpan is like, well, copyright is not about the money. And all of us are like, surprised. He's
*  like, it's about all of the money. We're like, okay, like, so that was a very kind of, I guess,
*  to your to your wife's point, like a very sort of cynical way to look at the law, but but but
*  helpful. And so, you know, in a scenario where New York Times can get an ongoing royalty forever,
*  like, of course, they're going to try to go for that.
*  But just to be clear, that wouldn't be possible today, aside from direct agreement by the parties,
*  like a judge cannot say you have to pay in perpetuity.
*  It's not it's not as clear here, you know, like there are scenarios where you know, like in the
*  Napster scenario, or you know, with watermarks, if you could show a specific number of copies were
*  made, you know, or in the context of patent lawsuits, there are sometimes like per unit
*  damages that are assessed. And that's that's the normal framework. Here, I agree with you,
*  it'd be technically quite hard. Although to the point of discovery, you know, you can come up
*  with math to support it, right. So New York Times had a graphic saying, okay, we're x percentage of
*  common crawl, common crawl is x percentage of your training data, divide your valuation of 100
*  billion dollars by that percentage. And that's what you pay. So you can come up with something,
*  but it's not going to it's not going to be very clean, to your point.
*  Very interesting. How do you how do we think about the different modalities? Because on the one hand,
*  we have text. And it seems like if I'm cracking this, it's like, okay, if you directly memorize
*  and regurgitate an article, you're probably in some trouble. And it's, you know, they kind of
*  recognize that to an extent where they're trying to fix it. Then on the other hand, you know,
*  we've seen a lot of Mario and Luigi images generated from Dolly three. And those are not like,
*  exact reproductions. But even though they're kind of different, and they might even be like,
*  quite different, you know, then it still seems like those are kind of drawn in the in the circle
*  of things that are not allowed or, you know, where you would have to pay royalties on them or
*  something. Right. So how should we think about different modalities from text to image and then,
*  you know, maybe music or I don't know how many different modalities we can really consider, but
*  it seems like it varies. Yeah. So you've got kind of an overlay of,
*  you can get to exponential complexity pretty quick because you've got, you know, the four types
*  of IP that we started with at the top of the hour. And then you've got, you know, kind of
*  X different modalities with video, images, text, music, et cetera, brand. And, you know,
*  the number of legal permutations and then technical permutations, you know, I do expect that
*  they're probably either Congress or courts will have to come out with something more clear,
*  or we're going to have like the canonical case for each type. You know, in the case of Mario,
*  you know, Sony for its video games and Nintendo as well, they're incredibly active rights holders.
*  And you can see why, you know, a billion people have played Mario and, you know, their creator,
*  I read an article about him. Like he literally he's like, he he's in kids dreams. Like this is
*  like a thing that, that creating this, this world. But then you think about when, you know, one of
*  the most savvy acquisitions, Disney's acquisition of the Marvel universe was, you know, it's all IP
*  and that the ability to exploit that again is, is something that they paid for. And that Disney is
*  an incredibly successful enduring corporation because of it. And so in terms of the different
*  modalities, like I do think New York Times case is cleaner being just text, but we're going to see,
*  you know, the visuals are incredibly compelling. I made a bunch of Mario's myself. But if you think
*  about the idea expression dichotomy, even Italian plumber, you can think of lots of permutations
*  that aren't Mario. I'm like draw an Italian plumber. Maybe he's super stylish and he's like
*  that die work wear guy on Twitter. Like, you know, he's got his like perfect suits. Like
*  that's literally, that would be more Italian. I'm Italian, like, and I don't dress like Mario
*  or whatever. And so you can imagine that the ones where it's so clearly, it's like a feeling
*  and the fair use cases on copyright that get at graphics, they really are about that, that sort of
*  like, is it so clear that the impression that this alleged infringer gives is so clearly the
*  original that there's no way they could have come up with it on their own, or it's just like not a
*  thing. That's the test that's used. It's a difficult test, but it's been applied. There was a,
*  um, a restaurant that was inspired by, oh, SpongeBob. Yeah. So it was like a SpongeBob inspired
*  restaurant, but it was like all the same stuff. Like the crab looked the same. Like I think they
*  called them, it was like the, the, the rusty crab instead of the crusty crab, something like that.
*  Anyways, in situations where it's so clear, like I think even in a, in an AI context, you're going
*  to end up with licensing. And what I would expect is some kind of brand registry. So now if you ask
*  OpenAI to, if you ask Dolly to make you Mario, you get, you get an error. And if you ask for
*  Italian plumber, you know, they probably created a bunch of keywords, but I would expect they'll
*  have some sort of self-serving UI for publishers and rights creators to kind of claim things.
*  But again, you know, how scalable is that? How clear it is, you know, DMCA is very clear that
*  was a congressional solution. So you could, you could end up with that here too. I haven't studied
*  in detail how OpenAI opt out works. You may know more about it, but my understanding of the current
*  state of play is that OpenAI has created an opt out on even just for the tech side. And they have
*  done a deal with Shutterstock on the image side and perhaps other deals as well that are not
*  disclosed. So interesting that they're, they're going proactively for the licensing on the image
*  side. And on the tech side, they're basically just saying, Hey, you can opt out if you want to,
*  not entirely clear, even on a technical level, how that would work. If you've just, you know,
*  you trained GPT for 18 months ago and now it's kind of baked, right? And like, are you really
*  going to be able to extract or you're not going to retrain? So what exactly does that opt out mean?
*  It would be easier to understand if it was just at the level of like the browsing features. I don't
*  know if you have any more kind of clarity on that. Yeah. Yeah. So OpenAI points to in August, they
*  rolled out a specific respect for robots text robots.txt. So you can just give the instruction.
*  I think it's like OpenAI, you know, colon, do not crawl or something, or we can put it in the
*  shout notes, but that is, that would apply also to if you have images on your site. So you can do it
*  that way. But in terms of models that are already trained, so GPT 3.5, et cetera, you know, you can't,
*  you know, it's like a cake, right? You've baked it with flour. You're not going to extract the flour,
*  the vanilla in a cake, like, okay, it's been transformed at this point. Exactly. It's a cake,
*  right? So, you know, especially in the case of these small ingredients, like, you know, you might
*  cook something with nutmeg and have like two little shakes in there, but you can tell. And so that
*  would be New York Times argument is that like, okay, two little shakes, but we made the model
*  this much more fluid or whatever. But technically though, I'm with some of the commentators on
*  Twitter have said, you know, if they're going to figure out AGI, they can figure out and not
*  have infringement. And there's people that have said that they're using GPT 4.5 to actually do
*  the copyright analysis. So if you ask for some of these queries where you're like,
*  give me an Italian plumber or saving a princess, my experience, my own testing, I get like the
*  start of a result and then it'll catch itself. It'll say, you know, it'll render and it'll say,
*  you know, error or copyright policy. And so some people on Twitter have opined that maybe they've
*  got the more advanced models checking for infringement on the prior models.
*  That is definitely an interesting strategy that I do believe they are pursuing in various ways. And
*  both kind of forward and, you know, they're trying to do this weak to strong generalization as well.
*  So they've got a lot of like model. Well, this is just out of their super alignment team. I
*  shouldn't say just because it is a, I think it's a big deal. And it's, I haven't figured out quite how
*  I understand it yet or how much confidence I have in it. But basically they have the general
*  premise is the systems keep getting more powerful. At some point, they're going to be more powerful
*  than us. We still want to teach them like what we want them to do, but we need them to be able to
*  kind of generalize beyond our ability to supervise directly. So they then create like a toy version
*  of that problem where like GPT two, I think becomes the weak teacher and GPT four or whatever is the
*  strong student. And the question is like, if GPT two gives you sort of a, cause it's not that good,
*  right? But it, it kind of knows what it wants on, you know, they have different questions, whatever,
*  but if it can give you this sort of imperfect, but like directional signal of what to do, like
*  how does GPT four learn from that? And does it perform better perhaps than the, does the strong
*  student perform better than the weak teacher? And they show at least some weak to strong
*  generalization. I'm not a big believer that this is about to solve our problems, especially given
*  some of the hacks that I kind of understand that are included there. Like one of them is the,
*  so you would ask like, well, how, uh, how much better, you know, can the, the strong student do
*  relative to the weak teacher? And it seems like they can turn up the Delta, right? The, the, the
*  strong student improvement relative to the weak teacher, they can, they can increase, but they do
*  that by increasing the confidence of the strong student. So it's like, basically they make it more
*  willing to override the, the weak teacher and therefore it can do better. But I'm kind of like,
*  well, wait a second. If the solution is going to be to tell these super strong AIs that they should
*  just be more confident in overriding their weak human teachers, like that doesn't sound like a
*  scheme that I'm like ready to bet the fate of the world on. That's fascinating. It's, it's so
*  interesting. The teacher metaphor though, like that's what I'm taking out of what you said is like,
*  as a matter of pedagogy, like that's been one of the most interesting things. And I teach this in
*  my, I teach a prompting class for lawyers. And in that class, I make the point that like
*  these models are basically fast, smart, over eager interns who have read the entire internet.
*  And so like in that scenario, some of these methods, like, you know, I think there was a
*  guy that found out that you could, you could tell open air or GPT that you would tip it and it would
*  do better. You could somebody even tried it with a dog treat that you can say, you know,
*  get this answer, right. You'll get a dog treat. And so it's, it's interesting that like, whatever
*  the behavior, you know, if you have like, I guess, anthropic does a constitutional AI thing,
*  or, you know, the super alignment, like whatever it is that you don't want copyright infringement,
*  whatever, like, how do you actually teach it and encourage the model to do that? It's, it's a
*  fascinating question. I'll have to read, read more on this like strong student or weak teacher. And
*  I'm like, oh shit, am I the, am I the weak teacher? And my students are great.
*  The premise is that humanity collectively is the, is the weak teacher. So eventually anyway,
*  and you know, depending on how much credence you want to put into some recent Sam Altman
*  comments, like perhaps not even that far into the future.
*  Yeah, that was a great conversation. The one with Bill Gates, I was super, super interesting. He
*  also, I thought it was funny that he said his most use software is Slack. So I was like, okay,
*  he's human like the rest of us. Okay. So coming back to the,
*  the intellectual property stuff for a minute. And then I do want to spend, if you have a few extra,
*  I'd love to hear a little bit more about your company as well. The AI doctor of our, you know,
*  global humanitarian dreams is too good of a promise to lose out on because we want to protect like
*  the Marvel cinematic universe and Disney's rights to exploit it. Right. So there's like something
*  here where the collective good has to Trump at least some IP considerations. I feel confident
*  in stating that does the law have anything like that today?
*  Yeah. So, I mean, I think like the sort of software and biotech having different interests,
*  as an example, has been the case for some time. And, you know, the patent system, you know,
*  you mentioned a lot of people say it's broken. And then it's like, okay, do you separate out
*  pharmaceuticals from software? So there are examples of that in the context of fair use,
*  like, you know, to the credit of the law since whatever 1851 when fair use was first a judicial
*  doctrine right around New York times when New York times got started. But anyways, back to the 1800s,
*  it causes this kind of public good balancing test. And it's not a surprise, right? That in
*  open eyes blog post in response, they said, you know, not only were we fair use, but we're good
*  for the world. And the link that they cited, you'll appreciate this because it's a legal thing.
*  They cited somebody's dog saving the life of their dog using chat GPT. Now, two things
*  interesting about that. One is that, you know, obviously the it brings to mind the public good,
*  but two is they didn't cite to a human that saved themselves because they knew there was like
*  liability and they say we're not a replacement for a doctor. So they picked a dog sample.
*  Similarly to you'll see fit that famously can tell if you're pregnant, right? So when you're
*  pregnant, you have more blood in your system and it shows up in your in your heartbeat and
*  your other stats that Fitbit can say. And when they talk about that because of the law that says
*  Fitbit is not a medical device, it's a personal fitness device, blog posts about that are like,
*  and then I talked to my doctor and they confirmed. And so they're always sort of like citing the
*  doctor. So the law will find a way I do think, like I said, you know, the cats out of the bag,
*  you have a bottle. This technology is, you know, what's gotten me so excited as a builder is like,
*  I can't stop thinking of these cases to use this for like, you know, and that was not the case for
*  me with, you know, with blockchain or with web three and like, you know, it's interesting and
*  I can see the rationale for it, but it doesn't have this like, oh my gosh, we could apply to this,
*  we could apply to this, we could apply to this. I was talking with a friend who's a plaintiff's
*  attorney and they mentioned that when they're deciding whether to basically to go to the mat
*  and sue a company, some of these soft factors like that would come out of like crunch base of like,
*  does the company have money? How do they act to lawsuits? You know, that kind of analysis is deep
*  and takes a lot of time and you can imagine, you know, a transformer trained on all of the law
*  and all of, you know, current business could come up with that result pretty quick. So like things
*  like that where my lawyer friends in particular have even gotten excited, which we're not,
*  we're kind of like engineers, we're not super like excitable and we're sort of naturally skeptical.
*  And so GPT has reversed that. So I think the possibilities are super strong and
*  like I said, I'm maybe, you know, I'm not quite Mark Andreessen level, but I'm quite a tech
*  optimist on this. A couple of other questions that come to mind there, one that we didn't even talk
*  about it really at all, but you know, if I were to say what has surprised me about how 2023 went,
*  the fact that there hasn't been more pushback from the kind of licensed professional classes
*  is definitely pretty high up on my list of surprises. I would have guessed we would have
*  seen like an AMA versus open AI sooner, right? You're giving out medical advice without a license.
*  Yeah, you caveat or whatever, but really everybody knows that everybody's asking their medical
*  questions here. As far as I know, not much of that has happened really at all. We've had like a
*  couple of the sort of tragic comic stories of like the lawyer that, you know, had GPT draft the thing
*  and like filed it and got in trouble that way. But we haven't seen this like major clash of interests.
*  Do you have any theory of why that is? It could be like, maybe they don't have as much standing
*  as I think, or, but I'm surprised that there hasn't been more conflict there.
*  You know, it surprises me a little bit. Certainly, you know, I do see some of it. So,
*  you know, the California bar came out with guidance about using ChachiBTE. And then,
*  of course, the story made big news. And, but you've got, you know, even John Roberts of the
*  Supreme Court said a few weeks ago in his report on the state of the judiciary, you know, that this
*  will change legal practice and that, you know, that legal research will soon be unimaginable
*  without AI, was his quote. And, you know, why that is, I think a couple things. So one, it's
*  super useful. You know, literally like, I can draft, you know, using my product, which is,
*  sits on top of GPT-4, I can draft a demand letter that would have taken, you know, 10, 15 minutes,
*  or even an hour in like a minute. It's pretty good. Like it's, it's literally like the jaw-dropping
*  moments I have in my classes from lawyers. So there's sort of like, it's good. Like that's,
*  that's one thing. The second thing is we kind of remember the internet because we're in it. Like,
*  most people who are in law, you know, practicing lawyers now, you know, you're going to be at least
*  20, you know, 25 to have gotten through law school. And you remember, you know, kind of the internet
*  coming up and Google coming up and you're, you're a, you're like a digital native, I guess. And so
*  based on that, I think the sort of future of the profession gets it. And then three, I think this
*  like unbundling of expertise, you know, has been happening for a bunch of years. You know, Ben
*  Thompson had a good article about it, you know, in Stratechory about how, you know, he gets all these
*  eyeballs, but he's just a guy on the internet. And that really is the democracy of, of tech. And
*  that's what, what tech would point to. Now the query though of like, you know, how, what will it
*  mean to be a lawyer? We, you know, we are worried about that. Like I definitely, you know, there are,
*  there are some folks who are like, kind of like, oh my gosh, where's, where's my job going? And,
*  and you see that and you definitely, you know, hear about it. But then we see the case of the,
*  you know, the made up cases or, you know, occasionally you get, you know, maybe GBC 4.5
*  or future will be better, but you do occasionally get garbage in response to legal queries, like
*  fairly often. And so, I'm really bullish on lawyer in the loop or professionals in the loop,
*  but doctors, I don't know, doctors, the other thing, I mean, physical, like you still need
*  to be seen. So I think like Dr. Google is like not great. Maybe Dr. Chat DPD is better, but,
*  but we'll see. Yeah, it's happening quick. There's another recent paper out of Google
*  DeepMind where they have a chat bot competing against humans and also against humans plus AI
*  for diagnosis purposes. And it's one of the great buried leads. I'm a collector of great buried leads
*  in the AI space. And this is one where it's like, by the way, the AI is outperforming the human two
*  to one. And it's also outperforming in terms of accuracy. It's like 60 to 30. Was that, was it
*  radiology or what was the, what was the question? They've been on a tear with a, you know, a series
*  of different things. This one in particular was a chat modality only, I think. I need to double
*  check that, but it was by far the biggest Delta that I've seen between human and AI in the medical
*  field. Like previous results have been more like they're comparable or like the AI is narrowly
*  edging the humans out, but we shouldn't overinterpret this. And this one is like getting
*  to the point where it's going to be pretty hard to come up with all the caveats, you know, to be
*  like, we really don't have to take this at face value because the ratio is, you know, a full two
*  to one in terms of just getting to the right diagnosis. So certainly there are things that,
*  you know, what I always tell people is if I have a serious health issue, I will want to use both a
*  human and an AI doctor. I'm not going to leave either one, you know, on the table at this point,
*  but, you know, I don't have access to that system because again, they haven't, you know,
*  put it out there, but it sounds, you know, very, very good. And, you know, at two to one,
*  it's like going to be hard to defend the licensing regime. No, I mean, that's right. I mean, if,
*  if you have access to one, one of the bar associations actually has this California bar has a
*  duty of efficiency to your client where, you know, if you have access to, if you have the possibility
*  of using a tool to zealously represent your client, you're actually kind of, you're obligated
*  to do it. So it's an interesting angle, you know, including for a doctor, you know, if, if your
*  ultimate goal is patient health, then yeah, you would want to use these tools yourself. And then,
*  you know, but, but I think it's, you know, somebody's got to train it too. Right. And,
*  you know, in this case is trained on the whole internet to my point where some of these common
*  issues, like I've been part of continuously part of an online mom's group since my first kid was
*  born 18 years ago. And I've written probably volumes of things about various kid ailments.
*  And so, yeah, probably, you know, like these ones that are funny, like toxic synovitis, I'm like,
*  what the hell is that? Sounds super duper scary. Okay. Randomly, if your kid ever like their leg
*  like freezes up for like a day, it's that, um, you can ask your doctor and they will calm you down,
*  but you're like, oh my God, I can't say no, but you discover that I, at least I discovered it
*  through these online forums. And then like, you know, I called the doctor and that was the case.
*  So, um, yeah, I mean, I think it'll be, I mean, again, I get back to the optimism and I share
*  your, both your curiosity and your, your excitement about it. Two more big picture questions. And then
*  the company. So open source, we haven't really talked about throughout this conversation. It
*  certainly changes the practical reality. Um, if all of a sudden, you know, GPT four were
*  ordered destroyed, you know, we would still have mixed role, you know, and it would be out there
*  and it's just kind of out there, right? There's a company behind that. You could see them, but
*  we also see these like increasingly, you know, collective forms, whatever. There's certainly a
*  way to organize and train a large model such that there's really not going to be a good target to
*  sue. And also like once the weights are out there, they're out there. So on the practical sort of,
*  you know, ability to enforce or, you know, ability to go sue somebody or to extract rents, like
*  open source does seem to change the game. How would you think about that from a legal standpoint
*  though? Like, is it relevant in the New York times first open AI that they would be like, yeah, by
*  the way, like this is all out there, you know, for everybody and free and, you know, with nobody that
*  you can sue or does that just kind of have to sit to the side for the legal purposes?
*  Well, a couple of things. So first of all, there's like kind of always somebody that you can sue.
*  Like, yeah, if it's open source, like spoken like a true lawyer, exactly. There's always somebody
*  you can sue, you know, in the case of like, you know, whoever provides the resources or you can
*  sue somebody for hosting it or, you know, there's like things to do, but, you know,
*  how does it change the picture? I think open source is just one more way you can exploit your
*  rights, right? Open source is not, you know, what is it? Free is and freedom, not free beer or
*  whatever. Like it doesn't mean there's no money changing hands, right? And so all the great open
*  source companies that we've seen come up and, you know, like, and just models, like, you know,
*  I follow JJ on Twitter and, you know, he makes a great case that open source is actually both
*  the way to advance software and to make a lot of money. So like, I don't know that it necessarily
*  changes the New York Times picture. I do think there will be something around, you know, crawling
*  and trespass and providing some kind of opt out. You know, otherwise as a downstream user of the
*  open source, you can see the downstream users and yeah, okay, you got it off the internet,
*  but you knew it sucked. It's kind of, then it goes to the Napster scenario where, you know,
*  you have the individual woman who was sued. It's like, oh, it's open source. I have no idea. Like,
*  it would be hard for a legitimate company to make that argument. And you see open source
*  compliance being a big thing, right? You know, there's startups now that are checking how you
*  do your open source dependencies using AI. And so, you know, whatever the problem is, you can apply
*  AI to that problem and then you can find somebody to sue. So that, that would be my take there.
*  Okay. So last big picture one, you know, you said earlier that it's kind of hard to predict how these
*  cases will play out. So I won't, if you can do that, if you want to, but honestly ask you
*  to predict how the courts will rule. But I guess I'm really curious as to like, if,
*  how would you rule maybe under current law? And then maybe even more interestingly, like,
*  what do you think the law should be? You know, we have this kind of congressional paralysis that
*  unfortunately leaves us, I think in a spot all too often where we're like, well, we couldn't hope for
*  any new, you know, rules to, to really be appropriate for this. So we just have to kind of,
*  you know, force everything through the old paradigm. But I would love to hear, you know, some,
*  you know, some forward looking thoughts on like, if we're going to write new rules, like,
*  what do we think they might ought to look like? What should the rules look like? So the scenario
*  where, you know, my friend, the influencer has got people creating GPTs exclusively of their work.
*  It feels like there should be a solution for that. And my prediction is actually that there ends up
*  being a commercial solution to that, where there are some startup that's like, Hey, GPT yourself.
*  Or it becomes so easy that this creator could input her website. And then it's literally like,
*  you can get her knowledge from there. So like some tech solution, where the original, like,
*  if you're literally wanting that person's insight and voice, there's some compensation on that.
*  So I predict some something in that nature, in terms of, you know, another interesting thing,
*  people have started watermarking, there's actually a, I think a company called nightshade,
*  where you can actually poison your images, where it will actually infect the training from there
*  forward. That feels kind of illegal to me. So, so I don't think that'll be the solution. But something
*  where there is some sophisticated watermarking, there's a bunch of startups looking at that.
*  I would expect that OpenAI or Microsoft or one of the players will buy one. And then it will become,
*  really the legit marketplace. And then the third thing I would expect is just a lot of deal making.
*  Right. So, you know, Kindle, which is digital technology that affected a legacy industry
*  quite a lot. There was still a lot of deal making directly from Bezos himself with the publishers
*  on that. So I would expect, you know, a lot of deal making in terms of how to rule, you know,
*  I definitely would do, you know, kind of what you, what you laid out Nathan, where it was like the
*  three or four different claims and really distinguish in the New York Times case, like,
*  okay, regurgitation. I expect the court would rule something like you must take reasonable
*  method measures to prevent it. And, you know, more of like almost like a tort type of type of
*  tort is a when there's a wrong in the law, that's called tort and like a tort approach to that,
*  I would expect. And then on the training issue, you know, it's tough, it's definitely, it's going
*  to be rolled transformative, but I think there will be some individual rights after, or maybe
*  register and you say, Hey, if you do a training on me, I have the opportunity to test it. Or you can
*  get a report. You can imagine OpenAI saying, here's the number of times that people ask for
*  something related to New York Times. So I imagine it will be a sophisticated suite. And by the way,
*  Google has had 20 years of being able to think about how to deal with IP claims. You know,
*  you can find there, they have a transparency report where they've got, I think it was seven
*  billion, they did 7 billion takedowns last year or something like that, like some crazy number.
*  So I expect a system to emerge. Yeah, this there's this anthropic research about influence
*  functions, tracing model outputs to the training data. I don't know that it's scalable on the
*  level that it would need to be to create a sort of Spotify like rev share, but it's the closest
*  thing I've seen to and I think it's probably flawed in many ways as well. It's definitely
*  not as clean as Spotify. You go on Spotify, you play the song, you know whose song you're playing,
*  you can kind of divide up the revenue in a pretty clear cut way. With these influence functions,
*  the purpose of the research was to show that with really small models, you have kind of dumb,
*  like, you know, kind of stochastic parrot like behavior. And that like keyword matching is kind
*  of a, you know, rough heuristic for what training data documents seem to most influence the
*  generated output at whatever, you know, for whatever query. But then as they go up to the
*  bigger models, you start to see that the the documents that are most responsible are like,
*  it's a much more sophisticated relationship, right, that they have not just simple keyword
*  matching, but like, genuine semantic, you know, relationship to what is happening.
*  And so this is like, you know, an interesting way of beginning to kind of quantify and they've got
*  some really cool visualizations as well that just kind of show that like, yeah, when you have a
*  small model, it's kind of working in a certain regime, bigger models are working in a different
*  regime. Would it be possible or reasonable to expect that they could calculate that for like,
*  every single, you know, chat GBT query? Probably not. I don't know how that seems like it might be
*  overwhelming, but there is at least some principled approach there where you could say,
*  this output, you know, connects to this somehow. Or maybe it's a threshold program, right? You
*  know, like you can imagine, you know, tick tock and all these others, you have to have a certain
*  number of followers, you know, on Twitter, you need a certain number of followers before you
*  qualify for monetization. You can imagine things like that. I mean, I don't know, I just laugh
*  whenever like, I guess I share. I don't remember if you were one of the people that tweeted about
*  this. But when the EU AI Act came out, it had a specific size of model that was regulated. I just
*  always think of like, was it Bill Gates or somebody famously was like, I don't see why you would
*  ever need more than 32 kilobytes of storage. And it's like, well, okay, I can see that now,
*  you know, so, you know, I would challenge tech and challenge the companies to think about how to do
*  it. Now, if that's distracting from, you know, amazing medical breakthrough, you know, okay,
*  but wherever there's money to be had, which there is here, then there should be innovation. And so
*  I would expect that if it's not one of the big players directly that one of these smaller players
*  will figure it out. Yeah, it's funny. It's like, it's amazing how obviously this is such a huge
*  emerging force in society, you know, the rise of generative AI broadly. And then it but it kind of
*  breaks some of our paradigms to like, you think about how little money artists actually get from
*  Spotify, you know, and then they're like, the effective rate per play is just so low. And that
*  feels like that this is coming here to you know, like the idea, open AI is doing whatever, you know,
*  some ungodly amount of tokens is a month ungodly amount of generations, but they're still only
*  doing like a billion dollars. So, you know, you kind of imagine like, okay, what's the rev share
*  on that? And now how am I going to spread it out and whatever. And next thing you know, like the
*  New York Times is probably not even getting very much now or even, you know, 10 or 100 x revenue
*  growth from here. And on top of that, they're like trying to push their prices down as low as they
*  can. And like, don't even seem to be, you know, there's a there's a weird non economic mode of
*  operation where they're like, not trying to make all the money they could make and trying to keep
*  their prices, you know, as low as they could. Some might argue if you were, you know, a data supplier
*  to them living off a rev share, maybe unreasonably low. It's just a very weird thing that is hard to
*  figure out. And then and then you throw in the the IRL component, right, Taylor Swift making a
*  billion dollars on her tour this summer, which was amazing. And it's like, okay, how does the
*  the money shift? Where does it go? And you know, is Taylor the only artist powerful enough to you
*  know, she wrote a letter to iTunes and brought them to their knees and had them switch their policy
*  on basically not artists not getting paid during the trial period. So I mean, you can definitely
*  like how this will shake out and the amounts of money that were the billion dollars now is going
*  to seem to your point like chump change. Well, there's a lot more many more shoes to drop. So
*  maybe we can get back together in the future with another case or with a new precedent,
*  or maybe even some new legislation. For now, let's talk a little bit about your company. So this is
*  usually I have to try a product before I'll do it on the show. But you've been so generous
*  and educating me. It's for lawyers. So actually, so I'm not selling to you yet. You are not my
*  ICP to use the startup terminology. But yeah, so basically, it's GCAI at get GC.ai. And it's in
*  private beta now because I want it to be good. But essentially, it sits on top of GPT. It's a chat
*  modality. But some of the warnings like GPT now gives warnings, as you said, where it's like,
*  I'm not a lawyer, consult a lawyer. Okay, I am a lawyer, you don't have to give me that warning.
*  So I've developed a bunch of prompts that make it speak more like a GC, right? So GC is bottom
*  line up front. Hopefully, I broke down the issues clearly. But some of the GPT, there's the viral
*  tweet from the Wikimedia guy that was like, GPT is a golden retriever. Okay, golden retrievers are
*  not good lawyers. And so basically, I've adjusted it to be good. So that's one. Two is really
*  thinking about really developing the vertical AI where it's part of my workflow, right? So Sam
*  Altman mentioned that his most used app is Slack. Well, so is mine. And that's where all the legal
*  questions come in, like, how do I get a copyright or how do I whatever. And, you know, so integrating
*  it there in the workflow, integrating it within Google Docs. And then for me, you know, it's
*  really about in house and at tech companies, you know, typically your lawyer is your in house
*  lawyer. Sometimes you interact with outside lawyers if you're in litigation, and certainly,
*  open AI is going to be in that boat now. But that's where I came up. And I mentioned getting so
*  excited about AI. That's where I'm applying. So it's get GC dot AI, and maybe not in the exact
*  target market, but I'm on the waitlist. Well, your wife, you said your wife's a lawyer. So maybe we'll
*  try her. But yeah, we're in the kind of feedback phase, you know, rooting out bugs and, you know,
*  hope to launch in the next month or two. Well, keep us updated on that. This has been a fantastic
*  conversation. I've really learned a lot from it. And I appreciate you taking the time to share
*  all your knowledge with me and with our cognitive revolution audience. Chachilia Zuniti, thank you
*  for being part of the cognitive revolution. Thank you, Nathan. This was super fun. Reach out anytime.
*  It is both energizing and enlightening to hear why people listen and learn what they value about the
*  show. So please don't hesitate to reach out via email at tcr at turpentine.co. Or you can DM me
*  on the social media platform of your choice. Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch
*  hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work customized across all platforms
*  with a click of a button. I believe in Omniki so much that I invested in it,
*  and I recommend you use it to use cog rev to get a 10% discount.
