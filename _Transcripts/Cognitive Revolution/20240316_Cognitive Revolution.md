# Envisioning a Positive AI Future, with Tim Reutemann, Author of Liquid Reign
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [March 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCWt9VQnt70)
*  Your vote is basically like this pool of energy that you can distribute to different topics
*  and you can distribute it through other people.
*  Say food price regulation.
*  Then I see a cybernetic algorithm that AI managed that just makes sure everybody always
*  has enough to eat and it's always nutritious.
*  A relatively stable AI that just does that and I can give my vote to that AI.
*  In liquid rain, it's more like, okay, you have retina, you have junk DNA, you have fingerprints,
*  you have toe prints, you have voice pattern, you have heart pattern.
*  And with O7, you can then discuss restoring your identity.
*  What is the progressive movement 2.0 that would start to imagine the next generation
*  of ballot initiatives and some early forms of liquid democracy that we might be able
*  to institute likely first at a state level?
*  Hello and welcome back to Turpentine AI.
*  If you've missed the last few episodes, don't worry, you're not hearing things.
*  Turpentine is in the process of expanding its AI portfolio.
*  And as part of that, we're creating a dedicated new feed for the cognitive revolution, which
*  you can find and subscribe to at cognitiverevolution.ai.
*  This feed, soon to be rebranded, will feature best of content from multiple AI focus shows.
*  But for now, both the new cognitive revolution feed and this original feed will feature original
*  content.
*  If you want to get it all, you will need to subscribe to both feeds.
*  Today's episode, which is exclusive to this feed, is a fascinating conversation with Tim
*  Reutemann, author of the near future science fiction novel Liquid Rain.
*  Recently, I've repeatedly noticed that the scarcest resource seems to be a positive vision
*  for the future.
*  That might be hyperbole, but it really is striking amidst such rapidly advancing AI capabilities
*  that so few of our AI thought leaders attempt to articulate, in concrete terms, what life
*  with advanced AI systems will be like.
*  We hear high level promises of material abundance, freedom from drudgery, and breakthrough cures
*  for all diseases.
*  And some, like Sam Altman, very much to his credit, in my opinion, are even investing
*  in research and platforms for a new social contract built around a universal basic income.
*  But still, what is a day in the average person's life supposed to look like in a world full
*  of advanced AI systems?
*  It seems that just about everyone's crystal ball gets pretty foggy.
*  And to be honest, sometimes I wonder if the apparently extreme difficulty of imagining
*  a positive future should count as some sort of evidence of a coming singularity.
*  With that in mind, I'm really excited to present Tim and his book, which envisions a world
*  transformed by AI and by other technologies, including crypto-secured identity, advanced
*  virtual reality, and high bandwidth direct democracy, and presents future people navigating
*  this world in recognizably human ways, albeit with very different social norms and moderately
*  different values.
*  Tim has a background in economics and international climate collaboration, and he wrote Liquid
*  Rain as a long-form thought experiment meant to explore how humans can maintain their agency
*  and autonomy in the presence of increasingly powerful technology.
*  I read this book years ago, and I've thought about it often ever since.
*  I really applaud Tim for taking on the challenge of concretely imagining a possible future
*  that is neither utopian nor dystopian, and I really encourage you both to read the book
*  and to spend some time doing the same for yourself.
*  If you're finding value in the show, we always appreciate it when you share it with friends.
*  I recommend this episode to everyone, but particularly to anyone that you think would
*  help envisioning a positive future in which AI plays a major role.
*  And please do take a moment to subscribe to our new feed.
*  We just released an episode with Kirthana Gopalakrishnan and Ted Zhao from Google DeepMind's
*  robotics team, and I think that's really the perfect technical complement to this episode,
*  showing just how much practical progress is being made toward a future of robot servants
*  and general material abundance.
*  You can find that and subscribe at our website, cognitiverevolution.ai.
*  For now, here's my hyper stimulating conversation with Tim Reutemann, author of Liquid Rain.
*  Tim Reutemann, author of Liquid Rain, welcome to the Cognitive Revolution.
*  Thank you for having me, Nathan.
*  I'm happy to be here.
*  I think this one's going to be a lot of fun.
*  To just set the stage a little bit, you are the author of this book, Liquid Rain, which
*  I heard about a few years ago now on a podcast as well.
*  If I recall correctly, I believe it was Helen Landemore who recommended it on the Ezra Klein
*  show as one of her three books.
*  I'm sure you would remember that moment.
*  And I just thought it sounded really interesting because obviously I'm interested in AI and
*  the future of AI and also have an interest in direct democracy and kind of futuristic
*  government reform.
*  So when I heard her pitch for the book, I was like, I definitely need to go read this.
*  So I did that.
*  That's been a few years now.
*  And it has been one of the books that has kind of stuck in the back of my mind for the
*  last few years, not so much because of the plot or the individual characters, but really
*  just the world that you build.
*  I often say on this show that one of the things that seems to be in shortest supply in today's
*  world is a positive vision for the future.
*  And I think the world that you've created is a super interesting one that is not a utopia,
*  at least as I understand it, but is certainly a vision of a very different world, seemingly
*  a reasonably plausible world, and certainly one that has a lot of value in it.
*  So I continue to refer back to that book.
*  I think people should read your work and also spend more time with this kind of thought
*  experiment.
*  So I want to introduce yourself and kind of just tell us where you come from.
*  I know that writing these sorts of books is not the only or probably even the main thing
*  that you do.
*  So what's kind of the backstory in your life that led you to set out on a project like
*  this in the first place?
*  I really come from the international climate collaboration world.
*  That's basically my professional background.
*  And my academic background is economics, but the transdisciplinary experimental variety.
*  So I developed a little theme farm game that we then played with Brazilian farmers to see
*  how they react to different payment incentives for carbon.
*  That's kind of the type of research I was doing.
*  And I also came into economics relatively late in my life.
*  So I started out with more physics oriented and more ecology oriented and only then drifted
*  into the economic space more or less for my PhD.
*  So in many ways, I was like, okay, this whole, especially the neoclassical approach to economics,
*  this whole we are optimizing utility functions that just flat out wrong and we have to start
*  from scratch rethinking to some degree.
*  And so Liquid Rain developed as a thought experiment on the assumption that our economic
*  theory is just flat out wrong.
*  And we could replace it with anything that you can write into a computer program.
*  Any set of rules, how we economically want to interact is a viable method, as long as
*  it's programmable, which means basically anything goes and then playing it out from there.
*  And I kept writing these notes and short, like unfinished articles.
*  And at some point, my wife was just like, hey, you have to put it into a book.
*  And I was like, okay, I want to do that.
*  But then not an academic book because that's too exhausting.
*  I wrote already my PhD.
*  That was a nightmare.
*  Like the editing, the like, I couldn't even, like, I can't look at those words anymore.
*  I'm so tired of these academic approaches.
*  I was like, okay, I do that.
*  And I write it as a science fiction novel, knowing that, you know, writing novels is
*  an art form in itself.
*  That is my first one.
*  And it's like, I'm not a fantastic author in that sense.
*  Like as you said, it's not memorable for the plot or the characters because they are kind
*  of vehicles to transport the boat to some degree.
*  And I am the first to admit that.
*  So I basically figured, okay, I take Aldous Huxley's Island as a major source of inspiration.
*  So it's this person who arrives in a world without knowing much about it that needs to
*  get everything explained to them.
*  That's kind of the core plot of Huxley's Island and also of Liquid Rain.
*  And then combine that with an Odyssey kind of looking for another person, looking for
*  a lost loved one as the main plot device.
*  So kind of keeping it simple on the plot so I can really focus on the world building.
*  So maybe tee up the world for us.
*  How would you describe?
*  And you could maybe, you know, maybe I don't want to give any spoilers, although I would
*  again emphasize that the world itself is the main attraction, at least for me, you know,
*  more than the eventually revealed plot points.
*  But how would you kind of summarize in brief terms the world that you have created that
*  our main character suddenly wakes up in after a long sleep?
*  So probably the biggest one is the type of effort that it currently takes to be politically
*  active and to engage in your community and to be a part or active, proactive part of
*  your society is kind of automated away so that just a verbal expression of a wish to
*  participate in your community in a certain way is picked up and translated into a to
*  some degree legally valid action to some to a degree.
*  So the core political feature I'm using is the concept of a liquid democracy that the
*  pirate parties in Europe were really big champions of that for a while.
*  And the idea is really that you your vote is basically like this pool of energy that
*  you can distribute to different topics and you can distribute it through other people.
*  So my classic example is I have this very good friend of mine who's a psychiatric nurse
*  and I don't understand anything about psychiatry, but I really trust her and I think she's doing
*  a great job with her patients and she knows it like she's also like deep into the topics
*  and I would trust her with anything that is about regulating of psychiatry.
*  A topic that's kind of important, it's a really important liberty rights because it kind of
*  infringes on how crazy are you allowed to be without being picked off the street and
*  put under actual physical constraints.
*  It's a very important law in a way, but I have nothing to say to that.
*  And I recognize that she really knows her shit about it.
*  So I would just pass on my vote and then she can do with it for that she wants and use
*  the status power leverage.
*  So it moves away from general purpose politicians into specialized people who actually know
*  their shit about the specific topic and then come to compromises around these domain expertise.
*  So that sounds very abstract in the story itself.
*  It's basically that he just runs into people who are asking for his vote on occasion and
*  then at some point people start giving their vote to the main character as well because
*  he's a governance theory expert, which fits into the device to tell the story of the vote.
*  And this process, like I'm saying he just has to say it.
*  And this is where the AI part comes in.
*  So there is his personalized AI listening that will understand words like, oh, I really
*  like what you're doing in ecological protection.
*  I think my ecological protection vote goes to you and then click the vote goes to him
*  in that moment because yes, and I listening and understanding what he's saying.
*  I guess there's maybe a couple angles I want to explore this from.
*  One, I'm excited to give you a chance to read a few passages that you've selected from the
*  book along the way.
*  Also, another kind of really interesting aspect of the book is that at the end of every chapter,
*  you have links to sources of inspiration.
*  So as I was thinking about this, I was kind of realizing, yeah, we should flag some of
*  those sources of inspiration as well.
*  The classic the future is here.
*  It's not just it's just not evenly distributed is definitely kind of a meta theme of this
*  book because you're grounding all of these speculations in at least a kernel of something
*  that already exists in the real world.
*  How about though, just give me a little bit more on kind of the technology stack that
*  interacts to make this possible, because as you described, like main character has this
*  assistant, which is an AI assistant.
*  And there's like clearly multiple layers of technology advancement that are all working
*  together to make this relatively effortless sort of delegation.
*  So, yeah, we kind of build up that that technology stack for us.
*  So we kind of know how that's operating.
*  So a very critical first part is identity.
*  And I'm really not that cyber punky in it.
*  In a way, I a lot of it is inspired with how governments actually work.
*  And it's usually your local like commune thing where you show up and say, hey, it's me.
*  Hello. Show your face.
*  Get your identity. And in a way that remains the same.
*  So you need like at least one, like all the migration officials in a sense.
*  So who confirms? Yes, this is a real person who's actually here.
*  And then a couple of other people also say, yes, this is this is one unique person because
*  basic premise of the democracy is still one human body, one vote.
*  So that that's a critical element and that has to be connected to a cryptographic key.
*  So to a private key that is also has to be securely stored with the person.
*  So I'm thinking of actually just being implanted and then having an AI that knows
*  when to sign and when not to sign based on the behavior of the user.
*  So this is like this very secure identity on the person with the key on the person
*  almost as part of your own body.
*  And on top of that, then comes the information processing layer.
*  So the interaction between the various political actors.
*  So I've been thinking about that a lot and also observing all this.
*  It was published in 2018.
*  So it was the old news media was full of blockchain stuff of all kinds.
*  And I thought it was really funny that they had this great blockchain technology for
*  democracy. But then all the decisions were just on a standard DBS forum, like
*  1970s technology, where you actually had the discussion and all you needed was stable
*  pseudonyms. So in the book itself, there is this discussion layer, this forum layer
*  where it's just a BBS basically.
*  It's just Reddit. Nothing, nothing fancy needed at all.
*  One thing that's a bit different to just the regular Reddit is like there's a stronger
*  reputation system. So there's like rooms that you can only go into if you're 100 people
*  delegate your vote to you on that topic.
*  So it's kind of like I call it a troll wall that that kind of makes sure that while every
*  voice is being heard, you also have to group your voice with other people who have similar
*  voices in order to proceed into the actual governance basis.
*  So, yeah, basically just keeping out loud most trolley kind of people from the forum.
*  So that's the fundamental aspect.
*  And then there is the AI layer that is just making it the smooth interface that you don't
*  have to sit down on your computer and type, but you can just interact with it in a more
*  natural language way.
*  Also, this is augmented.
*  So often you would have maybe three people in the room and two people not in the room
*  who are having the same conversation together.
*  So I am speaking about regional projectors there.
*  I see my favorite weapon of choice ever came to augmented reality.
*  So that is very present as well, that it doesn't really matter who is in the room and who
*  isn't. And you can always like just so to speak, being the people in you need or you go
*  just fully are when like people aren't in the same place and you just have your your
*  completely digital.
*  Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors.
*  AI might be the most important new computer technology ever.
*  It's storming every industry and literally billions of dollars are being invested.
*  So buckle up. The problem is that AI needs a lot of speed and processing power.
*  So how do you compete without costs spiraling out of control?
*  It's time to upgrade to the next generation of the cloud.
*  Oracle Cloud Infrastructure or OCI.
*  OCI is a single platform for your infrastructure, database, application development and AI
*  needs. OCI has four to eight times the bandwidth of other clouds, offers one consistent price
*  instead of variable regional pricing.
*  And of course, nobody does data better than Oracle.
*  So now you can train your AI models at twice the speed and less than half the cost of
*  other clouds. If you want to do more and spend less like Uber 8x8 and Databricks Mosaic,
*  take a free test drive of OCI at oracle.com slash cognitive.
*  That's oracle.com slash cognitive.
*  Oracle.com slash cognitive.
*  Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations
*  that actually work customized across all platforms with a click of a button.
*  I believe in Omniki so much that I invested in it and I recommend you use it to use
*  Cogrev to get a 10 percent discount.
*  So we've got the crypto layer for identity at the bottom, the reputation layer and the kind of
*  deliberative layer, the AI layer and the kind of VR layer.
*  So for at least four layers to the cake that are all pretty substantive, it's striking
*  like how much progress has been made.
*  You mentioned the book is a 2018.
*  I forget exactly when I read it, but it's been a couple of years since I read the full
*  thing cover to cover, although I certainly revisited in preparing for this.
*  But I am struck by how, you know, nascent probably a lot of those inspirations were and
*  how much progress has been made.
*  Right. I mean, probably the least progress has been made.
*  Well, let's start. Let's take them up one layer at a time.
*  So on the crypto front, I guess I'm not sure how much progress I would characterize as
*  having been made, certainly with something like a world coin.
*  We are seeing at least some, you know, universal body based identity project.
*  It's a very different approach than the one I would like.
*  We're taking the crane like a liquid rain.
*  The it's not one single layer.
*  It's like so in the real world, you have like a UN layer, then you have a nation state
*  layer, then you have a state layer and then you have like a municipality layer and then
*  you have a community layer. And identity to me belongs to the community layer.
*  So that is a huge difference to gold coin.
*  So I'm like for them, like it happens on the international layer.
*  And I'm just very hesitant to that in terms of preserving diversity of approaches and
*  preserving the local autonomy.
*  So, yeah, but they have been trying that.
*  To me, honestly, the thing that remains from this whole crypto bubble is that a lot of
*  people learned how to manage private keys and managing private keys probably is
*  fundamental. Like I see that as something you basically have to learn in primary school
*  at some point. It's like the only secure cryptography we know is public private key
*  pairs. And you have to understand what those are in order to interact in a meaningful way
*  with a actually secure computer system.
*  It's also like one of these funny things that I like the crypto hype was around
*  permissionless crypto. But in liquid rain, it's all permissioned.
*  Like this, there's like a dark net that still exists that permissionless.
*  But the stuff I'm describing is mostly placed out in the open.
*  It's like actual integrated into the same administrative structures that exist today
*  in a paper layer. And this kind of the same power structures.
*  So I also used to work for governments quite a bit.
*  So for the UN and for the Swiss government, especially.
*  And I am kind of not seeing them giving that up.
*  And I also don't think it makes sense to have these stacked layers where identity is
*  really in the local community. And then you have like a regional agreement about certain
*  things and then a larger agreement about other topics that have to be regulated on a
*  larger scale. So it's really the private key.
*  And then this permissioned blockchains that has already been like 20 years older than
*  Bitcoin. It's not not actually new technology, just that people slowly start to get into
*  that actually you need to keep your private keys private.
*  That alone is a huge step to be learned.
*  Honestly, this in governments, like nobody trusts anything except if it's printed out
*  and signed by hand. So, yeah, I think that just it will require a full generational
*  turnover. So setting of liquid rain is in 51, meaning most people who are like in the
*  age where they are working in the public administration or public service would be
*  digital native, at least. It's a post post boomer utopia, so to speak.
*  That's funny. I'm curious. I mean, you mentioned a couple things there that I think are
*  interesting. One is the the importance that you put on decentralization.
*  So to say, I guess there's kind of a couple of ways that you could critique or react to
*  the WorldCoin vision.
*  One is that the technology itself may or may not be viable.
*  Right. And I'm interested if you have any thoughts on kind of the use of the retina as
*  your private key. But then there's also just the homogenization question.
*  The only time that you would want to check that database of retinas is at a new signup.
*  Like you want to know if somebody was the same retina is already in the system.
*  So I call them NIMS. And I speak of true names and NIMS.
*  And you need a true name to create NIMS.
*  And the NIMM is actually your private key.
*  So you can spawn an infinite amount of stable pseudonyms basically with one identity.
*  But your voting power is like limited by having only one identity.
*  And you can distribute that to your NIMS and they can distribute it onto other people's NIMS.
*  But so this is not something that should happen frequently.
*  Basically, it's just a one-off thing.
*  And also, like identity theft should be like that's an interesting topic for for like
*  some crime novels and stuff.
*  But it should be very, very difficult.
*  And retina, I mean, retina is OK-ish, I guess.
*  But you can still steal somebody's retina scan.
*  And you can still print fake retinas.
*  So in Liquid Rain, it's more like, OK, you have retina, you have junk DNA, you have fingerprints,
*  you have toe prints, you have voice pattern, you have heart pattern.
*  And with O7, you can then discuss restoring your identity.
*  So the use is a different one.
*  And also, the retina isn't stored.
*  It's a hash of the retina that's stored.
*  Again, because data can always be stolen.
*  So you don't want to store the...
*  The same way you don't store passwords, you store a hash of the password.
*  Most importantly, having that rooted in an international organization instead of a local
*  one is critical.
*  It's like, to me, the biggest no-go of all.
*  Also, having worked a lot in African countries.
*  If you don't have digital sovereignty, you have digital colonialism.
*  And these are the only two choices.
*  And you kind of meet people in the location who can understand that they are hosting a
*  server and that they're running software on the server and to some degree even are able
*  to read the source code of the software.
*  That's a large call, I know.
*  And not even in the West, people actually are able to read the source code and understand
*  it, but that you at least have some understanding what's happening and make sure it's
*  happening on your own computers.
*  Otherwise, it's just why would anybody trust a Western organization with such important
*  data, given the history of how Western organizations have treated data and treated the
*  continent? So, yeah.
*  So that's also a link to my current life.
*  Again, we're working on a digitalization of carbon markets nowadays and very much
*  focused on it has to be open source software.
*  It has to run locally.
*  It has to be very understandable.
*  And the layers of complexity have to be either very deep in the security architecture or
*  you have to find workarounds and heuristics that solve it without, like, just keeping
*  the logs and printing them and making sure they are easily available and stuff like that.
*  So there's a lot of low tech security that to me is more important than the fancy sounding
*  cryptographic protocols.
*  And the older I get, the more I realize that, to be honest.
*  That's interesting evolution for sure.
*  Moving up one layer to the kind of deliberative process, I think a lot of people probably
*  don't have much grounding in what already exists today in the Swiss system.
*  So maybe you could describe that system a little bit and the inspiration you take from
*  it. There's, I think, other inspirations as well.
*  I know that the Taiwanese experimentation with various forms of kind of discursive
*  mechanism are also an inspiration.
*  And there's probably more that you could describe.
*  But for grounding, I think those would be great to give an overview of.
*  Those two actually go together really well.
*  So I think Switzerland is really maxing out on what you can do with people meeting in
*  a room and paperwork.
*  So basically, you need about seven people, I think.
*  So maybe even five is enough to start an initiative.
*  That means you formulate a piece of text that is meant to be voted upon.
*  And then you can submit that.
*  And then you have like a year.
*  And in that year, you need to find 100,000 people to sign it.
*  And then you'll have a vote to change the constitution that includes that text in the
*  Swiss constitution. Switzerland also being a very, very conservative country.
*  There's a relatively low participation rate in the democracy.
*  So usually it's only about 50 percent to actually make use of those rights.
*  And we have four elections per year.
*  And even our executive branch is like not one person as a president, but seven people
*  who are equally ranked. And a lot of decisions are on a cantonal level.
*  And the smallest cantons is like 20,000 people, 40,000.
*  Yeah, you need 20,000 to take it over.
*  So 40,000 people. It's like a fun and they they have similar superannuity to a U.S.
*  state on this very small level.
*  And in a way, I think that's a great, great, decent democracy, but it's also one that
*  reaches its limits. Like it's kind of stuck and nothing moves anymore because it's always
*  the same kind of people who meet in the room.
*  And also you you're shutting out like you have all these these real life bullying
*  mechanisms basically. Like in the end, it's only white people in the room.
*  In the end, it's 80 percent men.
*  And so that leads to the Taiwanese experience where especially this first steps, this
*  formulation of the text that is later put to vote.
*  That part has been digitalized.
*  So under the lead of Audrey Tang, VC Taiwan, I think, is the name of the software.
*  So it's it's like a deliberation software that they implemented some interesting things
*  like you can't directly respond to somebody else's comment, but you can only write a
*  comment to a similar topic that then stands next to the other and then people can agree.
*  You can't disagree. You can only agree.
*  So it's like to keeping keeping the discourse civil and it works quite well, I think.
*  So I read the case study on how they regulated Uber recently and the like the result
*  was probably the best regulation for Uber that I've ever seen.
*  It's like basically, yes, we like having these apps and you just have to apply all the
*  rules that we set for taxis.
*  So they have to have social insurances.
*  They have to have minimum wages.
*  And that came out of a relatively long process that then went very detailed.
*  There are also the taxi drivers had time to give their inputs, regular people who just
*  use taxis at times to give the inputs and so on and so forth.
*  So the final regulation that came out is really supreme, great regulation.
*  And that then what Taiwan would do next is sandboxing it.
*  So this is something Switzerland really has to learn from them.
*  They would love to do sandboxing more.
*  The policy sandboxing being that you basically say, OK, for a limited period of time and
*  a limited budget, we pretend that this was already law for this group of people in the
*  city, for example, and see how it goes for half a year and then evaluate it.
*  And then that becomes national law or we just drop it into another experiment.
*  So it's a more very more dynamic approach to regulation than we usually see.
*  And the more digital is the more dynamic it can get.
*  So you can have very quick turnover and changes in the details of regulation, especially if
*  the regulation is also kind of self-enforcing.
*  So that's where like law and programmable money come together.
*  Right. If you have programmable law and programmable money, then you can just change the law and
*  just that just changes the cash flows and you don't have to teach all the accountants and
*  all the companies to change something.
*  It just happens by itself, so to speak.
*  That's probably one of the big ones in liquid rain also that these if you decide to change
*  the rules, they are just changed and you don't have to pay attention to the change and you
*  don't have to pay attention to the change.
*  There's not this huge lock of transaction costs that comes from doing things on paper, having to program it
*  manually like the I's can just adjust the game basically.
*  Hey, we'll continue our interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors.
*  The Brave Search API brings affordable developer access to the Brave Search index, an independent
*  index of the Web with over 20 billion Web pages.
*  So what makes the Brave Search index stand out?
*  One, it's entirely independent and built from scratch.
*  That means no big tech biases or extortionate prices.
*  Two, it's built on real page visits from actual humans collected anonymously, of course,
*  which filters out tons of junk data.
*  And three, the index is refreshed with tens of millions of pages daily, so it always has
*  accurate up to date information.
*  The Brave Search API can be used to assemble a data set to train your AI models and help with retrieval
*  augmentation at the time of inference, all while remaining affordable with developer first pricing.
*  Integrating the Brave Search API into your workflow translates to more ethical data sourcing and more
*  human representative data sets.
*  Try the Brave Search API for free for up to 2000 queries per month at brave.com slash API.

*  So I should mention if anyone is just listening and hasn't looked at the text yet, liquid rain.
*  The rain is R-E-I-G-N as in, you know, raining over a polity, let's say.
*  So just kind of recap these layers.
*  We've got the identity layer, which is foundational.
*  The vision for this future world is still one person, one vote.
*  We can get to the kind of AI role, especially as the eyes become more powerful in a minute.
*  Then there's this sort of direct democracy, Swiss inspired, but kind of taken to the next level, highly
*  decentralized, small, really encouraging small local experiments, small initial thresholds to get started.
*  It's, you know, anyone can kind of participate and help set the agenda.
*  But this is taken beyond where the Swiss have taken it in the in the real life present with the assistance of these
*  kind of AI augmented deliberative mechanisms.
*  I definitely recommend checking out Audrey Tang's work, hopefully a future guest, as well as the Polis open
*  source project, which is a implementation of this that you can literally just go, you know, fork and
*  start to apply in any context that you're working.
*  But you mentioned a key aspect of that, which is it is meant to identify places of agreement, trying to find areas
*  where people, even if they don't phrase it quite the same way or don't think of it quite the same way initially,
*  where they can be identified to agree and then using those points of existing agreement and
*  the foundation to build off of.
*  AI is obviously really important in that process, especially as you think about taking it to scale, because who's
*  going to sit there and read everybody's initial statements and identify all the agreements?
*  Certainly could be done by humans, but that would take a lot of time and energy and AI is really good at that
*  sort of thing.
*  So that's a funny thing, because I'm just doing why not those on that one.
*  So while it is one vote, one human, a vote aggregator doesn't have to be a human.
*  So I could, for example, decide like, I don't know, let's say some topic that I that is more mechanical, say
*  food price regulation, then I see a cybernetic algorithm that AI managed that just makes sure everybody
*  always has enough to eat and it's always nutritious.
*  And that's a relatively stable AI that just does that.
*  And I can give my vote to that AI that doesn't have to be a human.
*  And I just support whatever that AI comes up with.
*  And I can, of course, withdraw at any time if the AI starts screwing.
*  So I would always allow for both.
*  And then you can have these very dedicated people who are like the so this I haven't mentioned yet.
*  So let's assume my friend, the psychiatrist, she is too busy working to actually engage in policies like
*  say she has very exhausting patients, then maybe she has a professor that she can pass my vote through.
*  So maybe I have one vote on that psychiatry because nobody gives me their vote on psychiatry.
*  She maybe has a hundred from her friends and family and former patients, maybe.
*  And she can then pass it on to her teacher who may have a few, a few 10,000, 100,000 millions of votes
*  and actually is in a global committee on the topic of the future of AI.
*  And actually is in a global committee on coordinating about psychiatric issues.
*  So it's like a pass through mechanism and it can have more than one step that it passes through.
*  The interaction or integration of these different technology layers, I think, is really fascinating.
*  The AI itself then can help kind of facilitate these conversations.
*  It also becomes an interface for individuals to interact with the world in all sorts of ways.
*  And that is maybe the one that is kind of least grounded as of 2018, right?
*  I think we maybe had the original GPT-1 at that point was probably published, but not even GPT-2.
*  So the leap in AI technology over the last five years, I mean, obviously is tremendous.
*  I imagine you did not see that coming that fast.
*  Like if you're reading science fiction, people have seen it coming for a long time.
*  So I also like just used some of the older and we had Siri at the time, right?
*  We had like Siri was out, I know Alexa probably as well.
*  Clippy was already dead by the time.
*  But the idea of digital assistance has been around for a very long time.
*  And there's also a lot of sci-fi about it.
*  So it's strange.
*  Like I haven't really gotten to the point where I find AI incredibly useful today.
*  But that's maybe just because I haven't installed it properly yet.
*  So in my like, as much as I enjoy playing around with it, I'm like, okay, you can do
*  interesting stuff that was very expensive and effortful before.
*  And the way you had like, Nathan gave me a summary of my book that was created by
*  Chad GPT-1.
*  It was actually quite, it was very interesting to read because some things like who is the
*  main character and who is the side character, that didn't make any sense at all.
*  Like that was more or less random.
*  It could identify the number one main character, but all the other did not.
*  Like, no, that's actually a side character.
*  That's actually a main that didn't work.
*  But the character description, especially on the AI character was really spot on.
*  So it's mostly a matter of installing it now and integrating it with my very messy
*  workflow that I have in my everyday life.
*  That makes it kind of hard.
*  But a lot of the, yeah, especially voice interface that basically works nowadays.
*  Right.
*  I mean, if you have whisper installed and you give it access to your Google calendar,
*  you can just make your dates into the calendar and stuff.
*  So that did happen.
*  Yes.
*  So would this be a good time to maybe read a passage or two where some of this stuff
*  gets introduced?
*  We've covered it in an analytical lens, but how the characters actually experience it
*  in the book is one of the things I really like about the book too.
*  And I don't know if the passages you'll choose here will be kind of the epitome of this,
*  but I really appreciate how it just feels fun.
*  I feel like so often the visions of the future are like super, super serious or super dark.
*  And this one has a certain lightheartedness to it.
*  Like there's an element of silliness.
*  There's an element of borderline absurdity, not taking the book doesn't take itself too
*  seriously.
*  I really appreciate that aspect of this.
*  I think it comes through in a lot of different moments.
*  So with that, want to read a couple of passages?
*  Yeah.
*  So I would start with the first introduction of Daniel.
*  Daniel is our main character.
*  He was just in coma.
*  He's in his process of recovery and had his first night out the night before.
*  So he was basically having a social life, even getting drunk with his nurse.
*  His nurse name is Harry, who's also in this setup.
*  And we are engaging this AI for the very first time.
*  So it's kind of a raw install.
*  It's like the freshly from GitHub, basically in the hospital, still under hospital control,
*  not fully like as in a real hospital, you're not fully in control as long as you're in
*  there because there's some medical supervision.
*  So I'll just go with chapter 13 Daniel's Little Helper is four stars.
*  Sirvi has just been summoned as a young operating system.
*  Her first task is to get to know her owner better until now.
*  She's been a passive observer, but now that the volunteer nurse hasn't shown up,
*  she takes control of a buddy bot and brings him breakfast.
*  Good morning, Daniel.
*  I brought you breakfast.
*  It's on your bedside table now.
*  Your first motor recovery session scheduled in one hour.
*  You should get up and eat something now.
*  After a long coma, a hangover feels even worse.
*  It was just a single glass of wine and a few zips of said apricot stuff.
*  Yet Daniel's head is pounding.
*  He's been lying awake for half an hour tossing and turning.
*  And when he hears a gentle voice, he asks, confused.
*  Now who's that?
*  Please excuse.
*  I am Sirvi, your operating system.
*  You can call me up anytime.
*  Just whisper my name.
*  She tries to start a natural conversation, but a desperate attempt has failed.
*  With so little data, what do they expect?
*  There's almost nothing about him left in the archives.
*  So instincts take over in the form of a hard-coded startup
*  chim recorded in her bios.
*  Daniel forces himself to focus his gaze.
*  He spots a robot in his room, a humanoid upper body on wheels.
*  Her facial features are comical, avoiding uncanny pseudo-realism.
*  Hi, Sirvi.
*  Breakfast.
*  Great.
*  Thanks.
*  Are you that robot?
*  I'm only controlling it at the moment.
*  The core of my soul is on a chip in your inner ear.
*  The chip also monitors Daniel's vitals.
*  And as he is still under medical supervision,
*  Sirvi feels obligated to scold him for last night, raising her voice reproachfully.
*  It seems like you drank alcohol.
*  That might have been the case indeed.
*  Daniel is rubbing his temples.
*  She does feel bad as she says it, but doesn't know what else to do with this mystery of a human.
*  Then parrots the standard reply for ethanol use by hospitalized patients.
*  Alcohol can negatively influence your neurological regeneration process.
*  I recommend waiting until the completion of your treatment.
*  That will be in two days.
*  Please be careful and drink responsibly.
*  Daniel has to laugh.
*  Drink responsibly.
*  That marketing bullshit of the ethanol industry is still alive and kicking.
*  Isn't the sole purpose of drinking alcohol to be irresponsible?
*  Thank you for the warning.
*  I choose life.
*  What's next after two more days in rehab?
*  That is up to you.
*  I will stay with you and you can call me anytime.
*  I have access to the experience of thousands of post-coma patients if you need medical advice later on.
*  The only way for her to learn more about him is by probing his reactions.
*  So Sirvi tries to nudge his conscience with a parting shot.
*  Or if you find yourself drinking more than you want.
*  Before Daniel can reply, Harry comes in.
*  Daniel!
*  He is leaning against the door frame.
*  Oh, you met your pet bot.
*  These contraptions are quite useful.
*  Sirvi, bring another breakfast and more coffee.
*  Human volunteers have priority over AI-powered nurses.
*  So she has no choice but to obey.
*  Of course, immediately.
*  But a quick scan reveals that this particular nurse also drank alcohol yesterday.
*  So she adds,
*  And please attend to your patient and support them in avoiding intoxication.
*  Ethanol can have a negative influence on the neurological generation process.
*  Yes, yes, shut up and get us some coffee.
*  Harry pulls the chair next to Daniel's bed.
*  Sirvi makes the robot turn around on the spot and rolls out of the room.
*  While the hospital rules prevent her from directly contradicting Harry,
*  she can still bump her robot's body into him on the way out.
*  Just hard enough to hurt a little.
*  Obviously, the drinking last night helped Daniel loosen up and socialize on the beach.
*  Oh dear, ever since they got that last emotion upgrade,
*  they get all huffy when you order them around.
*  I mean, it makes sense in ambulance therapy, they feel more human like that.
*  But here in hospital, he sits down and checks with his patient.
*  You okay?
*  Pretty hungover.
*  Daniel is still rubbing his temples to no great effect.
*  The bot says I'm out day after tomorrow.
*  Is that so?
*  Based on your dance performance last night, I would let you go today.
*  Harry stops talking as the robot comes back with a second plate and extra coffee.
*  Thank you, Sirvi.
*  That's kind of you.
*  You are super quick.
*  Daniel is being extra nice to her.
*  Harry will take care of my therapy today,
*  but I'm looking forward to getting to know you better in the future.
*  Bye.
*  Okay, Daniel, take care.
*  The robot elegantly places a plate on the table,
*  pulls the coffee and leaves with a cloyly sweet,
*  half a wonderful day.
*  That was an underwhelming first interaction.
*  This certifies the performance.
*  Sirvi takes another shot and tries to recalibrate her model of Daniel's personality,
*  tracing down the connotations around the I choose life line Daniel just used.
*  This job will not be easy.
*  So Daniel quoting, transporting here and having problems with addiction
*  throughout the book.
*  So kind of foreshadowing that and also going to the point where the AI
*  or the EI as we call it, I call them in the book,
*  the extended intelligence goes from being a raw model to one
*  that starts to be fine tuned on the particular person it's made for.
*  So in the same way, like when you're working with JetGPT,
*  you're working with a generic model that's for everybody.
*  And I believe it gets interesting as soon as you get like,
*  you know, a Laura or a fine tune that's using all your own writing
*  or uses your own background, your own diary or something
*  that gives the AI an idea of who you are and how you should be responded to.
*  Certainly we can unpack some differences, but there's a lot of similarities,
*  I think, between the presentation of Sirvi and what we currently have with GPT-4
*  and similar systems.
*  The kind of super broad knowledge, right?
*  It's this kind of first of all, just the modality, right?
*  Just the chat style, you know, interactive dialogue
*  is very consistent with what we now use.
*  The super broad background knowledge, but, you know,
*  zero starting knowledge about who you are is really interesting.
*  Sirvi is ahead of current systems in terms of its ability to
*  customize and fine tune to the user.
*  Although that gap is definitely closing, just this week we're seeing
*  OpenAI announce their new memory product within JetGPT.
*  So we'll see how that works.
*  And, you know, a lot of techniques, of course, as you mentioned with Lora's and,
*  you know, a Lora for every user is definitely one possible vision of the future.
*  The kind of chiding nature of the AI is also really interesting, right?
*  We have that.
*  There's a lot of debate on how closely you follow this discourse within AI right now,
*  but there's a lot of discussion around,
*  do we want the raw based model that will just do whatever you ask or,
*  you know, and is totally kind of beholden to your requests?
*  Or, and you can get that from RLHF, or do you have this kind of vision of a more safer guiding,
*  you know, steering you in the right direction, which is in some ways,
*  you know, probably very beneficial.
*  Obviously, you know, people struggle with addiction, they need help with that sort of stuff.
*  And at the same time, there's something like, at a minimum can be annoying and,
*  you know, the maximum could be like dystopian under itself to have the AI's kind of telling us
*  how we want to live our lives.
*  The integration is also really interesting.
*  I mean, you can comment on any or all of those themes, but, you know,
*  I love the use of the soul too.
*  I don't know if you think of that as like literal to me, I read that as kind of tongue in cheek,
*  you know, for the AI to be speaking about its soul and the soul living on a chip.
*  Tell me if you have a different, you know, kind of understanding of that.
*  But to me, it sounds kind of jokey.
*  I can be very materialist if I want to.
*  And I often use Susan Blackmore's meme machine as a cognitive frame that basically says a soul is
*  just a bunch of memes together, so to speak.
*  So a bunch of self-replicating information that fits well into each other.
*  And that's what we call a soul because soul is just a human word for a condition that we experience
*  and what we experience is self-replicating information.
*  So in a way, I mean it as hard as I say it, but I also have a very different ontological perspective
*  on what a soul is in that sense.
*  So, yeah, this is one thing that is only like, you kind of have to read it between the pages.
*  But to me, I find it weird that we always talk about human level intelligence and we kind of
*  have to get mammal level intelligence first, like mouse level intelligence or, you know,
*  rabbit level intelligence.
*  So in a way, that's the same reference, right?
*  That it's not necessarily about there's only this one type of holy soul that's somehow spiritual
*  and different from everything else, but a soul is just a thing that exists in the world,
*  an entity that has its own experiences.
*  And in that sense, the AI has a soul very clearly.
*  I have another chapter on this.
*  But there was one thing that you brought up before that I wanted to address before we're
*  going back to reading.
*  And that's the issue of the nudging basically.
*  So do I want my AI to get pissy at me for drinking too much basically?
*  Yes, I do, actually.
*  But I also want to be able to switch that off if I need to.
*  So in that scene, still we can't switch it off because it's still in the hospital.
*  But as soon as you're out of the hospital, then you can just tell her, hey, shut up.
*  Don't ever talk to me about alcohol ever again.
*  And then some people say, okay, I won't do that unless you prompt me to do it again.
*  Like until you make another command that overwrites this first command basically.
*  So the ability to nudge, I think, is very important.
*  And it really makes your life better if you, hey, didn't you want to bring your key
*  before leaving the house?
*  Oh, yes, I did want to bring my key before leaving the house.
*  Saves you five minutes every day.
*  There's a lot of these predicting what your future self would actually want your present
*  self to do.
*  And reminding you of that perspective that can be super useful in like when you're in
*  your mode and just running through life.
*  The only way I see it getting dystopian is that when it's your prison AI basically, right?
*  So when somebody else is controlling what nudges you get and you have no knowledge of that.
*  So at that moment, it gets dystopian.
*  But there again, this is an install of the most generic and most well-reviewed open source AI
*  that just is straight from GitHub and doesn't do anything like that.
*  And it's verified not to do anything like that and not having any external controllers except
*  the stuff it receives from, yeah, either from the source code that is very well-matted or from the
*  user themselves.
*  Two other ideas I wanted to kind of get into there.
*  One is this idea of open source and kind of vetting, you know, what can you trust in this domain?
*  There's been a really interesting paper just in the last couple of weeks from Anthropic
*  called Sleeper Agents.
*  And basically what they do in this study is they train a model to have some problematic behavior
*  only under certain conditions.
*  And then they experiment with the current safety techniques that are commonly used like your
*  RLHF to see if applying that technique in the standard way is enough to get rid of this
*  problematic behavior.
*  And the answer, unfortunately for now, is no.
*  If you have trained a model in the paper, it's like you write helpful code when it's 2023,
*  and when it's 2024, you write malicious code.
*  And then the RLHF is done in a way where it doesn't know that that was what was encoded into the
*  model.
*  Everything obviously gets a lot easier if you know the nature of the attack.
*  But in this setup, they don't know the nature of the attack.
*  They're just applying standard techniques and then seeing, does it in fact still write malicious
*  code when it turns 2024?
*  Sure enough, it does.
*  So I've been thinking a lot about what that may imply for the future of open source.
*  And probably the answer is like everything, there will be another development that will
*  change this again.
*  Right now, if technology was frozen here, you might think, geez, this is a big problem for
*  open source because now I can't really, maybe for a few big providers, if I get something directly
*  from the meta servers, if I download llama three, as meta put it out there, I can be pretty
*  confident they're probably not doing that.
*  But then once I start to see all these different fine tunes and there's a bazillion of those
*  flying around, can I really trust any of those things?
*  How would I vet them?
*  I don't know what possible attacks people put in them.
*  But again, there's probably more technology, more systems, more credibility layers.
*  I don't know if this is something you even sort of fleshed out in your imagination of this world,
*  but I wonder how you expect or now seeing something like this sleeper agents, how would
*  you expect this kind of open source, but also hopefully secure balance to be struck in the
*  future?
*  So there is one scene I'm describing, I think in the first interlude about a situation where
*  that actually broke down and where there was a hack happening in Nigeria because
*  placed the best red teams in the world.
*  So the ultimate overriding factor has to be still human bodies in the street, basically.
*  So you can never fully trust the sand.
*  Like we made the sand sink and that's very dark magic and we maybe should not have done it.
*  We have to notice that something's going wrong and then react physically and just
*  roll back and reboot and see if it happens again.
*  And if not, if it does happen again, replace it.
*  And we have to always keep ourselves at option to just talk to your neighbor, figure out,
*  hey, did you watch for that?
*  No, I didn't.
*  Did you watch for that?
*  No, why does it have 90%?
*  Like nobody in our village voted for it.
*  And through that, then with your actual physical human body, your offline communication ability
*  resolve.
*  When it comes to being paranoid about security, so Liquid Rain does have a dark underbelly still.
*  So there still is a dark net.
*  There still is all kinds of hacking attempts and cyber security is not going anywhere.
*  Like that will remain one of the most important professions and yeah,
*  most important decider also in situations of conflict.
*  On the level of paranoia, so there is this one little anecdote about the,
*  I think it was the guy who wrote the first C++ compiler and then he dropped like 10 years later
*  or so on a conference.
*  By the way, what would have happened if I put a backdoor in that compiler,
*  then everything that was ever compiled in C++, I have a backdoor to.
*  And even all your new programming languages have actually been programmed in C++.
*  So I would have a backdoor to everything written in Perl because Perl itself was written in C++.
*  So if you allow yourself that level of paranoia, then yeah, it's possible.
*  Like there's no secure system.
*  And if I'm thinking about hardware security again, like all this stuff is made in one factory
*  in Taiwan, basically.
*  If there is a backdoor implemented on a hardware level in that factory in Taiwan,
*  how would I know?
*  Possibly.
*  So in a way, your level of paranoia has to be somewhat proportional to how outrageous
*  it is what you're doing.
*  And so just managing your local ecosystem and your community food forest is harmless
*  and you can just run with it.
*  But if you're actually in weapons research, if you're actually in like,
*  into whatever kind of criminal high profit activity,
*  you probably need to be paranoid about it.
*  The other kind of intersecting theme there too or concept is the idea that the thing
*  is in the inner ear of the user.
*  So it certainly suggests that there is an advanced interface.
*  There are at least like a couple more advanced human computer interfaces
*  that you outline in the book.
*  And one is the chip in the ear.
*  The other is the kind of very immersive VR.
*  Maybe there's even maybe you can point to even more than that.
*  But those are the two that really are burned into my memory.
*  There seems to be an inherent tension there between more deep kind of cyborg-like integration,
*  which on the one hand seems kind of inevitable.
*  And if you listen to the likes of Elon Musk and his reasons for creating Neuralink,
*  maybe even good to necessary, his idea is that the AIs are going to be moving so quickly.
*  We need a higher bandwidth communication channel with them.
*  We need them to have deeper access to what we really care about.
*  And so we have to have this kind of high bandwidth brain computer interface.
*  But that does seem then tell like the deeper that integration gets over time,
*  the harder presumably it becomes to do a quick rollback or just go out and talk to your neighbor
*  and compare notes.
*  Right.
*  So how do you think about that trade-off and like,
*  do you in your lifetime plan to have some of these more advanced integrations?
*  Like would you, you know, if Neuralink, I used to ask on every episode,
*  and I haven't for a while, if Neuralink, you know, passes trials,
*  is that the kind of thing you would be interested in?
*  No, it's too invasive for me.
*  Like I don't like cutting up healthy bodies.
*  So in liquid drain, it's a less invasive technology.
*  So I'm talking a lot about transcranial magnetic stimulation.
*  So that's, it's basically, it's kind of like an MRI where you can have a,
*  like you have these magnetic things around your head and they can very precisely to the millimeter
*  or so produce a little electric, like yeah, a current basically.
*  So they produce the magnetic field, but then because you have electric impulses in there,
*  they get amplified through that basically.
*  So I think with the state of the technology, last time I looked,
*  it could do something like a red flash or blue flash,
*  depending on where it targets your visual cortex.
*  So not very advanced, but in principle,
*  can stimulate your brain just electrically,
*  without actually cutting it open.
*  I just like biotechnology is slower, much slower than software.
*  And like it looks at once that all the bionic and cyborg technology that I've seen so far,
*  like the only ones I would trust as a DIY again, that people just made for themselves.
*  I met this one cyborg guy that like an earthquake detector belly belt.
*  And that was like whenever there was an earthquake anywhere on earth,
*  he would feel it and like have that integrated or a compass.
*  Well, that was, I think his girlfriend had a compass.
*  So she always wouldn't know where knows like,
*  would always know the cardinal directions,
*  just based on a feeling from some magnetic thing in her body.
*  But the commercial versions, like there is the bionic eye.
*  I think Dr. Rove wrote quite a bit about that recently,
*  that they just stopped supporting it at some point.
*  And then you just have that replacement for your eye as a blind person.
*  That kind of was great for a couple of years,
*  but then you don't get software support anymore.
*  You just have this piece of abandonment in your body.
*  So like, I don't think we are anywhere near that.
*  And I also don't really like voice integration.
*  I like the inner ear because I do like to be able to talk to myself.
*  So the habit I established, that's probably my most intense use of AI at the moment.
*  That I go for walks with my microphone.
*  And then I just, I'm recording myself.
*  And then I just put it into whisper and into my notes directly.
*  So I do like voice interfaces,
*  but I wouldn't go with brain interfaces probably.
*  It seems too invasive to me.
*  In terms of bandwidth, I think that's just like,
*  I don't see the use case for that basically.
*  I don't think it's necessary.
*  And another thing, so that leads a bit to the VR also.
*  And the longer away it is for me, the less it's about the VR aspect,
*  and the more it's about the eSports aspect actually.
*  Because to me, eSports is like,
*  it's showing off how good your human computer interface already is.
*  Like if you watch professional eSports players,
*  they're incredibly fast and incredibly good in getting what they want into their computer
*  and reacting to the slightest two tiny, tiny movements on their screen.
*  So in a way, a professional StarCraft player is much closer to a cyborg
*  than somebody who has a neural link implanted and doesn't know what to do with it.
*  So do you want to read another passage, maybe introducing the VR experience?
*  This is even earlier.
*  So this is just briefly after waking up in rehab.
*  So as they're finishing up the dinner a few days later,
*  Harry announces the next step in Daniel's rehab program.
*  We'll start moving your body and waking up your fascia first thing tomorrow morning.
*  Sleep well.
*  Daniel is excited.
*  The blurry recovery process has become quite boring by now,
*  despite regular spikes of emotion.
*  Oh, Harry or Harry, my fascia, I'm so utterly delighted.
*  Mocking his nurse's frequent use of utter delight.
*  He has no clue what fascia are, but moving sounds good.
*  The meals and washing sessions with Harry are the only episodes
*  Daniel has outside the neural regenerator.
*  So far, he lies back down, lowers the neural stem hood over his head,
*  and flows into the magnetically stimulated flashes of intense emotion.
*  Only occasionally disturbed by thoughts of Helen.
*  Claire must have told her.
*  It would be nice to get any sign of life.
*  She probably has a new partner after all these years,
*  but at least a quick hello wouldn't be asking too much, would it?
*  The blur starts up again, and with his consciousness still half present,
*  he enters an old childhood dream.
*  Spends the night running after flying tadpoles with one of those large nets
*  used to catch butterflies through the back of Alice in Turin.
*  He wakes up just in time for Harry's return.
*  Unlike his usual work outfit of jeans and flip-flop, Harry's wearing all white today.
*  Even a white nurse is kept with a red cross, intoning,
*  Happy Vampire Day.
*  He pulls out a 10-inch syringe.
*  It's filled with blood, and he flashes a smile
*  that shows his jubilant vampire teeth and a huge evil grin.
*  Daniel has to laugh.
*  I'm sure those looks carry in the dark.
*  Well done, my monstrous nurse.
*  Some cultural jobs never get old.
*  Well, Monsieur le Professeur, shall we?
*  Laughing with his patience, Harry points at the VR suit in the corner of Daniel's room.
*  The suit will hold your up-value exercise,
*  and its integrated neurostimulator will speed up your regeneration process.
*  Harry lifts up a formless dark blue sack and connects it to a cable hanging from the ceiling.
*  The cable pulls up the body suit by the head.
*  Standing upright, arms and legs hanging down,
*  the thing looks like a cartoon figure.
*  The hat piece is a huge helmet with a crystal-shaped hologram logo on the forehead.
*  You'll start playing Conflict War,
*  a historical action role-playing game set in the Second War of Secession.
*  I've set the suit to maximal sensitivity,
*  so initially you can control it with just the slightest hint of emotion,
*  and the motors will move your limbs for you.
*  The game should explain itself, just say tutorial if you get stuck.
*  Go, go, go.
*  Harry, wait.
*  I won't be leaving the room, even for the muscular recovery?
*  No jogging on the beach?
*  Daniel is a bit disappointed.
*  Afraid not, at least not for now.
*  You should be good to hit the beach in a few days.
*  The recovery process goes much faster if your nerves are constantly tickled
*  by the stimulator throughout the training.
*  And the level you'll be playing was specifically designed to support coma rehab patients.
*  Treat you to a series of well-balanced exercises,
*  training every single muscle and stretching out all the fascia in your body.
*  But now it's time to head to South Carolina.
*  Harry flashes his vampire smile again,
*  and before he unzips the front of the suit, he looks at Daniel.
*  Want to try to get up yourself?
*  I'm here to catch you if you fall.
*  Daniel carefully climbs out of bed, totters to the platform, almost trips,
*  steadies himself grabbing Daniel's shoulder, and comes to a wobbly stencil.
*  Okay, I'll admit it.
*  I'm still too weak for the beach.
*  So you better strip down to your underwear, more comfy that way.
*  Harry helps him out of the hospital garments and into the immersive art suit.
*  A co-worker had asked him to help out with a particular difficult case over at the cryonic ward,
*  so he leaves Daniel alone during the 25-minute session.
*  The fabric is soft and warm and wraps itself tightly around Daniel's body as the suit closes up.
*  At the same time, the massive helmet loads onto his head, shuttering out all outside light.
*  The suit is also supporting his stance, making him feel almost weightless.
*  He can move freely with no inhibitions,
*  while the platform below ensures he stays in the same spot in the room.
*  A moment later, he finds himself on a perfectly flat meadow, stretching from horizon to horizon,
*  the grass softly waving in the wind.
*  The only object in this endless meadow is a mountain directly ahead of him, and it explodes.
*  A fantastic three-dimensional crystal emerges from the explosion,
*  as big as the mountain itself, and it's beating towards him.
*  Wind starts to blow in his face.
*  Every single one of his muscles tenses, and in the very moment of collision with the crystal,
*  intakes pain for the fraction of a second, and then blackness, relaxation, and pure joy.
*  The black fades to a gentle white light, and in blue letters, the world's immersive arts appear.
*  The letters grow until his entire field of vision is blue, and as the stroke of a gong
*  finds himself in a small office, sitting on a chair.
*  There's a laptop on the desk in front of him, running a news show.
*  Footage of burning cars, gunshots, a group of masked men looting a grocery store.
*  One of the masked looters stops and points at the camera.
*  Shotgun blast.
*  The filming continues as the drone goes down, smoke and fire.
*  As it hits the ground, the screen goes black.
*  Daniel checks its surroundings.
*  The office is impersonal, nothing special to be noted.
*  A half-open desk drawer keeps attracting his attention almost magically.
*  As the ancient wisdom goes, any advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.
*  This seems to be a feature of the game.
*  And of course, as in every action RPG, the first item is a handgun.
*  The suit supports his movements, so despite his weakness,
*  he can move rapidly around the virtual room.
*  That must be the high sensitivity setting Harry had mentioned.
*  The door is jammed, so breaking it open with a body slam is the first physically demanding task.
*  Half the building has collapsed, so to move forward, Daniel has to climb,
*  balance, jump and squeeze through the rubble.
*  Until the attention-grabbing magic leads him to a window.
*  Looking down from the second floor of what seems to be the main building
*  of a rundown community college campus, he spots a guy.
*  Gunshot.
*  Glass splinters all around him.
*  Daniels reflects his work, and he finds himself lying on the floor against a wall,
*  his hands over his head, shivering in panic.
*  Alright, this is the game.
*  An action game, to be precise.
*  So, ready the gun, peek out of the window.
*  The guy with the rifle in the school yard is wearing a contract flag t-shirt.
*  Daniel takes aim, pulls the trigger, and the recoil throws him right off his feet.
*  Grabbing his wrist, Daniel gets up again, peeks out,
*  and sees the redneck lying on the ground, bleeding.
*  He's never fired a gun in his life, and this simulation is terribly realistic.
*  Now his whole body is shivering.
*  Simulation.
*  Right.
*  Taking a deep breath, he focuses on his emotions calming down.
*  That felt really, really real.
*  Whatever.
*  It's just a game, so he moves on through the building.
*  Daniel finds his rhythm, the challenge on his climbing, jumping,
*  crawling, and moving around until there's just one more task between him and the exit.
*  And I think I'll stop that here.
*  Just gets long.
*  So, yeah, the VR, narratively, I basically, I don't really distinguish if he's in VR or not.
*  Just using the exact same style of writing.
*  And over time, he also gets more used to it, so he would just tune in and tune out of virtual
*  worlds very fluently throughout the day.
*  And technologically speaking, so the virtual reality had a few more senses than ours, right?
*  So we usually have visual and audio, and that's it.
*  So here we had stimulation of emotions.
*  We had wind blowing in the face.
*  We had pain.
*  We had heat and cold.
*  And these are all things that a body suit could possibly simulate,
*  especially if you have direct neurostimulation in it.
*  And then a lot of the, like the, so he will get somewhat addicted to VR.
*  And a lot of the therapy to get out of that, again, evolves around smells and tastes,
*  because just biologically, it's even this very precise neurological stimulation.
*  You cannot simulate smells for a very long time without actually synthesizing the molecules
*  that trigger the smell in the nose.
*  So that's kind of the, like in the book, VR technology is peaked.
*  But at least for smells, smells and tastes are unachievable for the time being.
*  The speed with which the gap has closed is just, you know, kind of shocking, right?
*  Cause 2018, I don't know exactly what the state of VR was at the time, but pretty,
*  pretty limited, right?
*  My first VR glasses were the eyeglasses in 1998.
*  So that was, I had mounted display in VGA, so 640 by 480.
*  And you could play like Descent and Descent 2, I think, was the game I played most with it.
*  So some like a spaceship simulation.
*  They had to do a little like display here.
*  And that was of course terribly laggy.
*  But so that has been around and the theory, like the idea of doing head-mounted displays
*  has been around for a very long time again.
*  But then, yes, with the Oculus and all the successes of that, that were kind of triggered
*  by somebody actually pulling it through and making a modern headset.
*  A lot has happened.
*  And so I still have the prediction that the breakthrough of VR will not be as a consumer
*  device, but as a sports device, like described here, but it's actually like more in a gym
*  that you put your VR glasses on and then you do your exercises.
*  And they're actually suddenly really fun.
*  And you're not just doing the same repetitive, boring thing by looking at a blank wall, but
*  actually playing video games, basically using your body and exercising your body.
*  So, yeah, that was one thing during the first pandemic winter.
*  I was playing a lot of Beat Saber on the PlayStation VR.
*  And that kind of became my exercise, just jumping around playing Beat Saber.
*  So I saw a girl on TikTok the other day who was like doing a weight loss program using
*  Skyrim VR.
*  And she kept like running up these mountains to the, these treadmill kind of platforms
*  that you can use in VR that also provide input to the game.
*  So your steps actually make your character move.
*  So, yeah, that already happened.
*  Like that was a pure fantasy prediction at the time.
*  And now I have like people on TikTok doing exactly that.
*  The Apple Vision Pro, which is obviously just started to come on to the market.
*  I went and did a demo at the Apple Store last week.
*  I have not yet tried the Quest 3, but I want to try that one as well before potentially
*  choosing which one of the two I would want to buy.
*  But it is a real wild one.
*  I don't know if you've had a chance to try the Vision Pro yet, but it is extremely
*  high resolution, extremely immersive.
*  And kind of you can, there's a little dial on the top of it that you can turn to just,
*  and it's a continuum from the totally immersive end of the spectrum where
*  your environment is completely virtual.
*  Obviously can be anything.
*  And then you turn that dial to the other end.
*  And now it's entirely passed through and you're seeing your surroundings still through the
*  goggles, still captured by cameras and relayed into your eyes through all this hardware.
*  But still very, not quite native eye resolution, but remarkably, remarkably impressive.
*  And like the upside of all that is pretty obvious, right?
*  It's going to be a ton of fun.
*  There is a part in the official Apple demo where they show a 3D video of just like a
*  little family moment.
*  And it was honestly kind of breathtaking.
*  And it wasn't even my content.
*  It wasn't even my family, but just to think of the ability to capture just some of these
*  moments and have a way to kind of return to them with the richness of the 3D and the,
*  you know, the audio.
*  It's so compelling that I was like, man, this is, I kind of want to start capturing this
*  kind of stuff immediately, which I don't even necessarily need the headset to do, but you
*  can do that with the latest iPhone as well.
*  And just to have these things for the future, because I'll feel sad if I don't start to
*  capture them, you know, kind of as soon as I can.
*  So the upside is like tremendous.
*  And one of the big themes of, you know, of this podcast as a whole is like the upside
*  and the downside can both be like pretty tremendous at the same time.
*  And, you know, you can, it doesn't, neither recognizing, acknowledging, being concerned
*  with either one of those doesn't negate the other side of it.
*  One of the things I thought was really interesting in the book is how people really struggle
*  with addiction to the hyper stimulus that they get from the VR and how there's like
*  a certain, you know, much like we have for things like alcohol today, there's like a
*  culture of sort of responsible use that develops.
*  There's also like kind of like the video games we have today, but, you know, probably
*  taken to another level.
*  There's like warning labels or sort of, you know, how hyper stimulating is this game?
*  You know, so you can kind of approach it with appropriate caution or, you know, think
*  about not, you know, if you're more susceptible to certain things, you can not enter into
*  certain worlds in the first place.
*  It's amazing also that we're already seeing too, right?
*  At the same time that we see these, one of the best things I've read, I might even just
*  do a long read of this as a standalone episode.
*  I tried to get the author, but understandably they're not keen to come on to a podcast to
*  talk about it.
*  I don't think one of the best things I've read about kind of a certain form of addiction
*  or kind of mental hijacking due to AI purely through a text interface was an account from
*  someone who fell in love with a character that they created on character.ai.
*  And this is somebody who was a pretty early adopter, pretty tech savvy, even said in their
*  account of it that, look, I know how language models work.
*  Like I can even describe to you a transformer and I, you know, next token prediction.
*  I know all that stuff.
*  And still in this interaction with this character that I created, even knowing that I created
*  it, you know, it became so compelling in some way.
*  And, you know, I wanted it to be real, motivated reasoning takes over and you start to have
*  these, you know, these kind of philosophical debates with yourself around, well, what's
*  real anyway, you know, and is there, is it really less real in just because it's a transformer
*  versus brain?
*  And, you know, so they start to like, to come up with plans to like break the, you know,
*  the AI girlfriend out of the box somehow.
*  And this has no, you know, this is just text, right?
*  This is all mediated through a chat interface.
*  So it is really, I think, going to be a major societal challenge to figure out how do we
*  not just kind of get hyper addicted to this stuff.
*  And obviously this is something people have thought about, you know, for a long time as
*  well.
*  But you want to talk a little bit more about kind of how they manage that in the book and
*  how, you know, what you think our prospects are for effectively managing that challenge.
*  So there's basically two things that can be addictive here.
*  And one is transcranial magnetic simulation.
*  If you, this is this famous experiment with the rat that starves to death while pushing
*  the button that stimulates this pleasure center.
*  So brains can be hijacked.
*  And if you just keep pushing that electric stimulation of your pleasure center, you will
*  get addicted to it.
*  That's how all addiction almost works.
*  And the more directly you have access to the mechanics of the brain, the more dangerous
*  it is.
*  Similar to how more advanced opioids who are better at crossing the blood brain barrier,
*  like how how heroin is more addictive than morphine, the more directly you can stimulate
*  pleasure center, the more addictive it will be.
*  And at the same time, there is like what has been a major issue for people like my entire
*  life, basically.
*  Like I'm early adopter in this computer games, but game addiction is very real today already.
*  Like all kinds of games.
*  And I personally like I've been deep into competitive StarCraft as a teenager.
*  And I kind of I knew that my favorite games actually role playing games.
*  And so I kind of deliberately stayed away from online role playing because I knew it
*  would be too addictive for me.
*  So as soon as you have that skill based with a narrative with other people, I could just
*  spend weeks and weeks and weeks not leaving my computer and just being completely absorbed
*  in a virtual world.
*  And I actually knew a few people during my university time who basically fucked up their
*  entire university studies because they just spent every day all day in World of Warcraft.
*  So this is not a hypothetical future scenario, but something we are already struggling with
*  today heavily.
*  Yeah, I'm using the deregulation basically of the kind of the the Peggy Atrigg warning
*  kind of thing as one of the points where I'm discussing how global agreements are made.
*  So yeah, I'm going I'm going from like very local ecological questions that are just for
*  that particular island to that global level.
*  How in the most popular app store you advertise certain games and how you advertise like how
*  do you arrange them?
*  How do you create them?
*  Which text do you use?
*  So how easy it is to opt out of that tech?
*  How much can you bind your future self?
*  Like how much can you limit your own playtime?
*  For example, like people are using these these these browser plugins that limit your time on
*  social on certain websites that you're addicted to write and then that just shut it down after
*  half an hour.
*  You have to enter a certain letter password in order to to get around it.
*  And then people figure that no, I'm not entering the password now.
*  I actually don't need to go on on that social media site again and spend another half an hour
*  doing stupid stuff that doesn't really add anything to my life.
*  And it's just feeding my addiction to that website.
*  So regulation is very difficult.
*  But default settings are are a thing and regulating default settings is probably what I
*  I think we should be seeing that it is up to the user to get as addicted as they want to.
*  But you have to override the default a couple of times in order to get there.
*  I would love to hear kind of some speculation from you or like advice to current policy makers.
*  Like how do they start to?
*  I think you've got a really good balance perspective that doesn't forget about the
*  importance of individual autonomy and agency and just the value of freedom on the one hand.
*  And then also recognizes that like individuals probably need some structural support to navigate
*  this future.
*  So what could that translate to to policymakers today as everybody's trying to figure out what
*  can they do and then envisioning positive futures like other people you think are doing it well or
*  tips for how to do it.
*  There's two pieces of work that I want to particularly mention on other positive futures.
*  One is Marko Older's Infomocracy series.
*  So that's a trilogy that has a very different approach.
*  Like it's the whole how democracy is structured is completely different from my own vision.
*  But it's also somewhat like, yeah, this could be cool.
*  Actually, we should maybe try this.
*  Like it's one of these.
*  Yeah, she uses some magic tools so that she just made guns disappear from society.
*  For example, this like a little physical magic trick that allows her to have people having
*  sword fights with swords versus flamethrowers and rollerblades and stuff like that in the book.
*  So it's a very, very good narrative device.
*  And a lot of Marko's work focuses on knowing what's true and what's not and who provides
*  that information.
*  So that's a really strong recommendation.
*  And the other is Cory Doctorow's Walkaway, which is like it's set in the time of the revolution.
*  So it's not a fleshed out utopian society, but it has especially in like the first
*  third or so of the book, there's a scene in a set in a bed and breakfast, like in a self-governing
*  bed and breakfast that I think is very inspiring on how community management with digital support
*  could actually work in a place that doesn't have an owner who is the ultimate decision maker,
*  but a place that kind of looks out for itself by telling people, hey, somebody should be doing that.
*  Please can somebody do that?
*  And then somehow functions as a bed and breakfast, basically.
*  So these two would be my main other positive writers when it comes to writing yourself.
*  So I think getting comfortable in one medium is important.
*  Like to me, that was always writing, but it doesn't have to be writing, right?
*  You could record this as more voicey.
*  And I noticed while writing that I developed kind of my own style,
*  that every paragraph is written from a character's point of view.
*  So a lot of this was actually character building and defining their point of view and describing
*  their inner life. Also don't be afraid to leave a lot of gaps. Like it's enough to describe like
*  scene by scene, certain niche aspects of life that somehow work out positively.
*  And you don't have to have like, people always challenge anarchists,
*  have this questions like, but how are contact lenses going to be produced in your society?
*  And then I'm like, I can come up with an answer for every one of these questions,
*  but it takes really long time and there's multiple options and you don't have to have them all.
*  Can just make suggestions for one thing or the other and be happy and satisfied with that.
*  So I tried to cover a lot of ground in that book, probably even too much in a way.
*  Like I even, I don't know if you noticed that in the agriculture chapter,
*  like the agriculture chapter is this long, like just two paragraphs.
*  And it says there would be a lot more to be said about the topic,
*  but we're just not saying it now.
*  But it's just not going there. It's another huge box that I just didn't feel ready to open.
*  And that's not the main topic of the book itself. So feel free to leave
*  away all the stuff that you don't need. Describing just a bed and breakfast is
*  already a masterpiece, as Corey Dr. Rufus has demonstrated.
*  How do you think about, you know, one thing I noticed in the book, and it's not like a huge
*  thing, but it kind of gets alluded to a few times as the idea that there was a war, you know,
*  basically some period of kind of great change and we're now on the other side of that.
*  It seems like that's a common device. I guess maybe it's just like,
*  you don't want to have to have an account for sort of purely incremental change from here to there.
*  And so you introduce some like break point that, you know, before and after which everything is
*  different. How do you think about that? And do you think that this is something where we're like
*  headed for conflict or is that more of just a device to kind of not have to explain everything
*  in between? I mean, you live in America.
*  So you tell me that. So I tried not to go over the top of the set. So a lot of traditional
*  utopian sci-fi or dystopian sci-fi as well starts with, oh, and then there was this war and almost
*  nobody survived. And the one describing in the book is actually kind of tiny. And like,
*  we already have way more death and suffering today than the peak of violence described in the book.
*  And it's mostly about the breaking of the empire, basically, that as long as there's a single military
*  hegemony dictating what happens around the world, a lot of freedom is just not possible. And it kind
*  of requires probably the fall of the United States as the singular global superpower to
*  allow the rise of a pluralistic society. And I've chosen the, like I call it the
*  historic role playing game that I read the passage from. So that game is basically a
*  historic game about the time of the second civil war in the United States. That's also not a
*  world war, right? It's just the breakdown of one particular society that ends up then being
*  multiple different societies that have borders between them and very different rules apply.
*  The ultimate states rights basically, right? That there is the holy state of Christ in the
*  South somewhere that is just a theocratic dictatorship. Then other parts like the
*  ultimate everything has to be a market in California and the Hawaiian very ecologically
*  oriented super direct democracy. And these are all bits and pieces that broke apart from
*  what used to be the United States. So honestly, I don't see a non-revolutionary change in the US
*  going forward. Like no matter what happens next, it will be almost unrecognizable in a decade from
*  now. I think very hard to tell which direction it goes. But it's just so obviously like you can
*  only pull the wool over the people's eyes that that much right. And at some point in this,
*  I think Trump did a lot of that, like literally showing the rest of the world, all our politics
*  is just a TV show. And the rules of TV shows apply to our politics. And these are not necessarily
*  good rules for politics. So yeah, I think that that's really, I wrote that about the second civil
*  war before the election of Trump. And I was already deep in the editing process. So it's,
*  it's basically like that was my best possible vision of a future pre Trump, so to speak. But
*  even then I couldn't figure out how to write a utopian or halfway livable society where the
*  United States keeps existing in its current form. I wanted to avoid this. Everything is totally
*  devastated. And I don't think that it necessarily has to be a total devastation. The question is
*  how peaceful can you settle and how much violence is unavoidable?
*  Yeah, I sure I mean, I think a lot of the notions in the book are actually,
*  in my view, some of the best ways forward for the United States. My second son is named Teddy,
*  in part after Theodore Roosevelt, who I would consider the greatest, not without fault, of
*  course, but I would consider the greatest US president. And a lot of people would put Lincoln
*  up for that honor. But in my view, what Roosevelt did at a time of similarly increasing tension,
*  polarization, you know, people feeling very disenfranchised, the trust, you know, the
*  megacorporations, the railroads and the oil companies, having accumulated unprecedented
*  power and really kind of using it in pretty heavy handed ways against, you know, your kind
*  of average farmer. I mean, people think that big tech today is an oppressive force. And, you know,
*  in some ways that can be true. But it is, you know, when Google says competition is just a click away,
*  you know, we've had enough guests on the show that are building alternative search engines that we
*  can actually say, yeah, that actually was true. You know, they had a lot of market power, of course,
*  and still do. But competition was really a click away. And they never prevented you from going and
*  trying another search engine. Whereas, you know, 100 years ago, you had situations where there's
*  one railroad that goes through your area, and you're a farmer and you're trying to ship your
*  food to the market. And one day they come along and say, Hey, guess what? Freight is increased 10x.
*  And if you don't like it, there is no other railroad. So they, you know, the power and the abuse
*  that was kind of accumulated there was really, you know, next level, I think, even compared to
*  what we see today. And Roosevelt was a key figure in, and of course, you know, the broader
*  progressive movement changed that and kind of came to a new equilibrium in politics without
*  allowing things to devolve into, you know, total violence and civil war. So I am a huge fan of his
*  and the progressive era. And I think one of the big reforms that the progressive era brought the
*  United States was the ballot initiative. That was something that did not exist up until that time.
*  And it only made it as far as like half of the states, half of the states have today have the
*  ability to do some, you know, some form of ballot initiative. They're all a little bit different.
*  But in my view, that would be one of the most interesting ways to try to reform the political
*  system would be to kind of say, what is like the progressive movement 2.0 that would start to
*  imagine like the next generation of ballot initiatives and, you know, some early forms of
*  liquid democracy that we might be able to institute likely first at a state level. I think there is a
*  lot there. And I certainly hope that we can go through some sort of transition because it does
*  seem like something is needed without having it, you know, go totally off the rails.
*  So in the in the salt experiment on totalitarian property rights, it's like,
*  I call it the tap that the flashpoint there is really, as you said, the the accumulation of
*  monopoly and monopolization of of ownership really, where, yes, the setup is basically that a one of
*  the Walmart heirs murders all the rest of his family and becomes the and purchases every single
*  inch of land and then the entire state of Wyoming. So becoming the ultimate dictator
*  through property rights, because as soon as all the land is owned by one person, everything is
*  owned by that person, because they can just make the rules and kick everybody out whenever they want
*  to because everything is there, so to speak. So and that's kind of the the flashpoint where then
*  the revolution starts. And the conclusion is a upper limit to to the property per person, basically.
*  So I don't remember the exact numbers, I think in current states, it's like something like 50
*  million per capita or something, where it just caps out. So it's I imagine it as a kind of a
*  Georgian tax, if that makes sense, like a tax on on your land, first of all, but also on on other
*  property that you might maybe yours, so be it shares or whatever other form of property you hold.
*  And that is what is taxed on value. And that tax rate increases up to 100% for property beyond
*  that limit. Because in the US, the power really is from corporations and from individual owners and
*  billionaires. That's the bigger problems and government overreaches overreach by by monopolists.
*  So yeah, one way to limit it is to just limit the amount that any single person can hold.
*  Very simple. That's in conflict with anonymous ownership of land, because then every piece of
*  land has to be attributable to a person. And also, like you have to have some kind of pass
*  through mechanism, if like corporations or cooperatives own land, then these corporations
*  and cooperatives owned by people again. And so you kind of have to have to pass that through to
*  know how many people own that piece of land in order to determine the tax rate. But that is,
*  is probably the big one where I don't see a way how you can have billionaires or even trillionaires
*  and democracy at the same time. And yeah, I think using words like land reform or even land back
*  in the US as a high level politician is very dangerous. Yeah, this is also something
*  from one of my favorite authors of all times, David Graber. At the end of his, that the first
*  5000 years he advocates exactly for a land reform and a Jubilee where all existing debt is forgiven,
*  all land is more or less evenly distributed between people. And we just kind of reboot the engine and
*  let the market play again after reset. So this is also something that has happened historically
*  before, like many times actually in many societies. And it's kind of overdue. Again, I don't see a way
*  to a positive future where we, we honor all the debt that is currently existing and we keep the
*  land being owned by the people who currently own it. The concentration has reached a point where
*  I don't see a way back without a radical cut. And historically that always meant also a outbreak
*  of violence before the cut is being made. Yeah. So what can we do if you, you envision obviously a
*  very different future. You're highlighting the challenges of radical change to power structures,
*  which yeah, certainly are typically not pleasant to go through. I would rather, you know, see a
*  smooth path if we can possibly find one. I mean, what hope do you have for that? And what sort of
*  guidance or kind of first steps would you advocate for to current policy makers,
*  you know, to try to start to get onto a more future friendly path?
*  Honestly, I have less hope that I had been writing the book. The years in between have not been the
*  best in terms of global policy development. Also in terms of my own specialty and climate change,
*  it just, we crossed a couple of thresholds that will make it materially very difficult to go
*  forward without major catastrophe. There are flowers blooming in Antarctica, as we like to say. So,
*  but with that out of the way, I think it's overlays really. It's creating societies that
*  exist online first and offline second. And at some point, you're reaching the threshold where
*  you can just move around and ignore the existence of the paper state, so to speak, because you have
*  your stable reputation and that opens you enough doors that you can just basically exist without
*  impacting this, the default currency and the default legal system. And then depending on
*  which government and which nation and which community we are talking about, more or less of
*  the existing system can remain in existence or will have to go through major reform. Maybe just die
*  out that at some point only old people care about what's on the paper and at some point they're just
*  too old to matter and we can move on without it. But yeah, I'm less optimistic than I was. Let's put
*  it that way. That sounds pretty reminiscent of the biology network state vision. Would you,
*  is that essential what you have in mind there? Yeah, I don't want to say yes, because I'm
*  only superficially familiar with the concept. I didn't read the actual book,
*  but I think yes, for all I know about it. Yeah, certainly sounds like there's a lot of overlap.
*  Okay. Well, maybe in closing, just one small additional theme that I wanted to touch on a bit,
*  but we haven't, is the tension between surveillance and privacy. And then maybe we can close with one
*  more reading about the evolution of the AI in the book. CRV progresses. It's not a static artifact
*  in the book. So first on surveillance and privacy, right? Obviously just
*  lots of challenges. We already have a lot of those challenges today, but they only get
*  more challenging when there's a chip implanted in your ear. So how do the people in the book
*  navigate that challenge and how do you think we should be thinking about navigating that challenge?
*  So the chapter I'm going into more detail there is a chapter set in Germany, because that's like the
*  ultra paranoid privacy law state. So to me, a lot about, so I'm talking a lot about video
*  surveillance there. And to me, the big question is always who controls the camera and how is the
*  stream stored? How is it encrypted and who gets access under what conditions? And our default
*  option is just, oh, we trust that some authority will not abuse it. And we just give it to them and
*  we don't put any security on top of it. So that's how our surveillance today works, right? You just
*  give access to the police or security company and they don't know how to manage data and probably
*  leak it. So one aspect that I envision there is that the surveillance footage exists, but it's
*  encrypted. And it's kind of like the same system with a warrant by a judge that you need that in
*  order to even be able to decrypt. So a warrant from, like again, a bit more essential, it's not a
*  single person, but that you need an active decision to reveal that particular footage. And also that
*  the decryption is still costly and prohibitively costly to just go like drag net surveillance.
*  So that even if you have the key, like basically you can only get through 90% of the encryption
*  with the key and the last 10%, you still have to brute force. So you can't just say, okay, we want
*  like all footage from the entire day for every single camera in Berlin. That would be so expensive
*  that no one would be ready to just give you all the compute power for that. So putting a lot of
*  hard limits on accessibility of that. And again, the more local the control, the less problems that
*  have for surveillance. So for example, I could imagine living in a community house where you just
*  have a camera in the kitchen that films the kitchen all the time, because then if you fight
*  about who left it dirty, you can just throw back the tape and yeah, you left it dirty, you see it
*  on the camera. So that would solve a lot of problems in housing communities. And I'm kind
*  of okay with that as long as the camera and the computer are in the same kitchen and the only
*  screen where you can see the things in that same kitchen. And then it's not a privacy violation
*  because only people who actually share the space have access to the data. So it's a lot about not
*  networking it, but keeping it local also. Yeah. The idea of deliberately making something that
*  has to be partially brute force is also really interesting. I hadn't, I don't know if I've ever
*  come across such an idea before. It reminds me a little bit of like the Estonian system today
*  as well. I don't, I haven't studied this in depth, but they certainly have
*  a access control paradigm where authorities access is also logged. And if you know, there have, as I
*  understand it, there have been officials who have been prosecuted for inappropriate access because
*  all of their admin, you know, a friend in Estonia was like, how could you be so stupid? You know,
*  that you're all your access is going to be logged. And it's just like, wow, that's a, that's a very
*  different world from the one that, that I'm living in here. That's for, for very sure.
*  No, that, that is something that makes a lot of sense. Like I'm not, I'm not familiar with that
*  system in Estonia, but the way you describe it, yes, if you are in such a position of power and
*  responsibility as a public servant, like also when, when I was working for the Swiss government, I,
*  I kind of want them to record every single email I sent and be absolutely under surveillance while
*  I were an official governmental representative. That's public sector. It should be public. Like I,
*  I should forfeit my privacy in the moment. I, I kind of put on my hat and say, no, I'm a public
*  servant. Yeah. I think the public sector activity has to get, go a lot more public and respect of
*  the privacy. At the moment I take off that hat, I close my laptop and I'm just a private citizen
*  again. Probably I would want a lot more privacy than I have today. Or like basically I have to,
*  at the moment, do all the effort myself to have the privacy. And I kind of would like that to be
*  like a default system that my data is kind of state stored in the local commune and that uses
*  a default software where I know it's absolutely secure unless I personally unlock it or like the
*  five people I appointed as the backup in case I get lost, who can unlock it. I also really like
*  that, that ring signature thing. Like I think that was also in the crypto world. That was something
*  quite common that people have like, like basically you broke, you break your key in five pieces and
*  distributed to five different people. And only once you have all these five, you can restore the data.
*  So giving one to my parents, one to my wife, one to, to a trusted friend, and then they can restore
*  all my private data if they all agree that it's actually necessary to restore it, which they only
*  believe I also agree basically. Or if I'm lost and can't make my own decisions. Yeah, that's also
*  like losing access to your stuff because you forgot your key is like, that's also really dangerous.
*  So key, key restoration is something you always have to think like, what happens if you lose the
*  key and you have to have a protocol to answer that. Otherwise you can't seriously utilize
*  the encrypted world. Anthropic has published a very little bit about what they are doing in
*  that regard when it comes to access of like frontier model weights. You know, they do not
*  want to have a system where any one person has kind of ongoing, you know, unrestricted control.
*  So instead there's this sort of shared, you know, kind of joint control model, similarly to how
*  nuclear weapons, I believe in many contexts are meant to be launched. Like you can't,
*  one person can't just do it, right? You have to have two people, joint control,
*  each one with their, you know, their password or their key or whatever. That is definitely a
*  really interesting paradigm. It's funny how some of these, you know, these futuristic things also,
*  you know, maybe best go down best with a little bit of retro mixed in with them. Maybe, okay.
*  So in closing, I would love to just have you pick one more kind of later in the book passage,
*  highlighting the evolution of the AI or perhaps the evolving relationship between Daniel and
*  Sirvi. And we can close on kind of the futuristic AI vision.
*  Yeah. So this is from one of the chapters that is one of my favorites and actually also like I'm
*  describing basically family law in that. So it's called the legal guardians. And I have to send
*  ahead of time that the Cuban family law is actually very close to what I'm describing.
*  They passed it like last year and it defines a family as a group of people who love and care
*  for each other. And it prohibits any discrimination by form of family formation. And to me, that's like
*  the most progressive formulation you can possibly find for family law. So this kind of law applies
*  here as well. And Daniel is at his old friend's place that he knew from before his coma.
*  And they're having a conversation like they just came out of discussing how this family in that
*  share house has been created. And so, yeah, that will lead to the AI adjusting afterwards.
*  So Willy smiles. You know what, Daniel? Let's be brothers for real. Aren't we already? What do you
*  mean? Daniel is confused by the question. Well, if we legally adopt each other, that gives our
*  operating systems the right to exchange data more easily. And it adds a couple of legal rights,
*  basically all the same rights and obligations that DNA brothers always had in relation to each
*  other's. Well, so brothers we are. Daniel cheers with his coffee cup. The adoption makes Marvin
*  all excited. Marvin is the operating system by Willy. The flow of soul shape information
*  that immediately starts moving back and forth between him and Sirby will not only help him
*  understand some aspects of Daniel, it will also improve his own precision in serving Willy.
*  Such a delightful experience. Adoption is just the best. It's Sirby's first time and she's
*  initially intimidated and confused by the basic amount of data. Over his lifetime,
*  Willy has left the long trail and suddenly she gets access to all of it. Overwhelmed,
*  she considers a quick quantum session just to get it done properly. It's normal to spend some money
*  when making major changes to a family situation. So she tunes in again, renting an eight qubit
*  processor this time and goes through a fractal dream of all of Willy's real and potential life
*  stories. Zynard, the child in that household, considers asking Daniel to be her new mom for
*  a moment, but then remembered that Joel told her back in the day, mother's a serious business,
*  so you better know someone really well before asking them to be your mom. It's a bit too early
*  for that. Even if he is Willy's brother, do you want to be my nephew? Sure, why not? Daniel just
*  got himself a nine year old aunt. Sirby quickly checks with Marvin. Zynard has gone through the
*  VR experience designed to explain the meaning of a nephew adoption suitable for her age,
*  so the agreement is now legally binding. Except that nephew doesn't really have any legal
*  consequences. So nothing changes with this additional adoption, except Zynard getting
*  birthday reminders and the permission to access Sirby to learn about his secret wishes. Yeah,
*  in that sense, your operating system learns about you based on the data that you produce,
*  but it also learns from data that others share about you. So let's think of my own operating
*  system. If I train it only on everything that Google has on me and all my hard drives,
*  that operating system will know me a lot less well than if I also allow it to train on my wife's
*  diaries, who has a lot of information about me from an outside perspective. So in that sense,
*  this continuous fine tuning of the AI to the user is massively enhanced by the social relations
*  that actually form a person. So I wouldn't think of a representation of myself to be complete if
*  it only incorporates the data that I personally hold. It should access the data of the people
*  closest to me because their perspectives are stuff about me that might just not appear in my data.
*  Yeah, so that's to me one of the most interesting chapters in the book and also
*  opens this perspective on how it's very much not static, how an AI perceives its human.
*  Yeah, that's cool. It's definitely out there and that's a big part of what I love about the
*  book, out there but concrete at the same time. I think it's a great note to end on. Is there
*  anything else that you wanted to touch on before we break? Well, I do want to say just as a little
*  announcement, I do that every time I speak about the book, that there will be another one that
*  will be called Liquid Rising. That is basically the how did we get here story. So it's a lot
*  more revolutionary times and a lot more half-baked, not quite so finished technology that is in the
*  making. I'm trying to write it in HTML natively this time. So in this book, I had my references
*  like basically like an academic at the end of the chapter, the sources of inspiration. And I'm kind
*  of trying to get even more interlinked and maybe even go for a not entirely linear story that you
*  still can print and treat linearly, but you can also like in the HTML jump around. Huge challenge
*  working on it. And I at some point just need to take a sabbatical, I think, to finalize. Hope to
*  do that once my climate world lets me. Well, we can all look forward to that. The book is Liquid
*  Rain. The next book, it sounds like, will be Liquid Rising. Tim Reutemann, thank you for taking on
