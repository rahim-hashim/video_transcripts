# AI & Identity, from East and West, with Yohei Nakajima, GP at Untapped Capital and BabyAGI Creator
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LjCTzjhALyc)
*  Hello and welcome back to the Cognitive Revolution.
*  Today we have a special episode with returning guest,
*  Yohei Nakajima, builder of AI agents and VC investor.
*  As you may recall, when Yohei appeared on the show back in October,
*  he had just recorded a talk at the TED AI event.
*  As of mid-January, that talk is now online for all to see.
*  Yohei and I sat down on the morning of his birthday to watch the talk in full.
*  Along the way, we paused it to discuss and expand on
*  some of the important themes that he raises regarding identity
*  and how Eastern and Western cultures relate to the rise of large language models.
*  This was a great conversation and I had a lot of fun doing it.
*  But unfortunately, when we came to upload the video to YouTube,
*  we got a copyright strike and we have not been able to resolve that.
*  To see this full episode after the upcoming few minutes of highlights,
*  I really hope you'll go to our website, cognitiverevolution.ai,
*  where you can get the audio only version
*  and also subscribe to our audio channel if you've not done that already,
*  and also see the full video on our Substack page.
*  So thank you to Yohei for suggesting this.
*  It was a lot of fun, a great conversation,
*  and I hope you'll go see the full thing at cognitiverevolution.ai.
*  I think Western identity tends to think of like, my thoughts are who I am.
*  And so my mind and my thoughts are my identity.
*  I do feel like Eastern cultures tend to treat the mind and the brain
*  as more of a tool to control, and your thoughts as an output of that tool.
*  And so like meditation and enlightenment is really about harnessing
*  how to leverage that tool.
*  As I get emails, as I get texts, as I follow people on Twitter,
*  as I read websites, if I could just convert all that into a structure
*  and knowledge graph of the people and entities and events,
*  it should be easier to identify potential people to reach out to,
*  to connect with, introductions to make amongst people.
*  I've seen a couple of early tools of like helping people understand each other
*  that previously wouldn't, or helping find commonalities
*  between two groups of people that might not be intuitive.
*  And I think if we can start to think about AI as a tool for that,
*  new ideas will emerge that can hopefully create a future
*  that's not as bleak as, right?
*  Some people see the future.
*  Maybe for starters, take us a little bit more kind of behind the scenes of,
*  literally, how do you do that work procedurally?
*  When I'm thinking about like building a next mod of baby,
*  is there any AI tool for that matter, right?
*  After I built like a first prototype, I will run it over and over again
*  with multiple different prompts and examples.
*  And I'll watch it do things.
*  And I just watch it over and over and over again,
*  until something like clicks for me when I'm like, wait.
*  And I mean, a lot of the stuff I would want to retrieve is online, I guess, right?
*  A lot of my work is I'm doing web research all the time.
*  And so I did find that with GPTs or with assistants,
*  you can actually just tell it to like do a web browse
*  with like a site specific search for example.
*  And it's kind of like you built a retrieval over a website.
*  I have a prototype, like autonomous CRM that I've been testing,
*  which I'm testing it with Game of Thrones episode descriptions from Wikipedia.
*  And so I'll like upload one episode description at a time.
*  And the idea is that it's like on the back end,
*  building a knowledge graph of all the information.
*  You're episode by episode, season by season.
*  And you would perhaps want a history of like this person is aligned with this person
*  and then they're enemies, you know, and there's kind of a,
*  you know, it's not just one fixed description.
*  I think the concept of identity in today's world,
*  a lot of people think about like, who am I?
*  And they make it really like, you know, internal versus
*  I wanted to get people to start thinking about identity as,
*  you know, your place in a larger system, I guess.
*  It was only after I grew up that I started to really appreciate
*  how much philosophy is embedded into language,
*  especially specifically Japanese language too,
*  because you're using Chinese characters
*  where the characters themselves have meanings.
*  A good example is a common way to greet someone is Genki desu ka?
*  Like, are you Genki?
*  Is how Japanese people greet someone.
*  But the characters for Genki are Gen is root and Ki is energy.
*  So it's like, how is your root energy?
*  It's like the most casual way in Japanese,
*  like ask someone how they're doing.
*  And I think that's like, that's a very philosophical way
*  to ask somebody how they're doing.
*  For me, and you know, I think for most who have just kind of
*  the traditional Western background, we do,
*  it is natural to think of ourselves primarily as individuals.
*  And, you know, then this thing is like this kind of weird
*  language model, and I've got to tell it what role to play,
*  tell it what individual to be.
*  What I didn't get into the talk is that a lot of these studies,
*  when they're looking at the interaction events,
*  they're also looking at the trails ants leave as part of the collective
*  intelligence of like a communication.
*  So if you look at a single ant, you would not consider
*  the trail they leave as part of that ant.
*  But when you think of the ant colony as an identity,
*  then the trails they leave, the tools they use to communicate
*  with each other become part of that collective intelligence.
*  So if you look at me individually, my computer is not part of my intelligence.
*  But if you look at human society as a collective intelligence,
*  then our computers, the technologies, the Internet all become part
*  of that identity of that collective intelligence.
