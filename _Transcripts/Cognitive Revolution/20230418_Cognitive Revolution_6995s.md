# The Art of Prompting ChatGPT With Riley Goodside
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [April 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zg3H-9nxkyI)
*  a lot of my like prompt, you know, like demos that, you know, I liken them sometimes to like,
*  you know, arranging like a ballet over lava. It looks like a slightly more impressive thing
*  than it is because like that's the point is just to show off what can it do like at its best.
*  My original claim to fame was I was the only data scientist at OkCupid before it was even
*  really called data science. Like they were into the idea of like, hey, let's just use statistics.
*  Right. Like that was their slogan. I think what it was, we use math to get you dates.
*  I think the best way to think of these is to sort of approach them as like Lego bricks,
*  right? That like each brick is like a capability of like some particular strong suit that you
*  think that you know that the model can do well. I feel like I have sort of acclimated to the level
*  of like skepticism that's appropriate for these models, right? Because like I've dealt with
*  models that hallucinate all the time about everything. And so I, you know, like anytime
*  it says anything, I'm like, yeah, but is that true? It's possible for somebody to be ignorant
*  of that. Somebody might use them assuming that this is all, you know, reliable, prepared information
*  because, you know, it looks like it, it looks like it has academic footnotes in it. But for
*  someone who's used to it, you can get a lot of value out of it, right? If you just like
*  approach it with skepticism. Hello and welcome to the Cognitive Revolution, where we interview
*  visionary researchers, entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial intelligence.
*  Each week we'll explore their revolutionary ideas and together we'll build a picture of how AI
*  technology will transform work, life and society in the coming years. I'm Nathan Labenz joined by
*  my co-host Eric Torenberg. Before we dive into the cognitive revolution, I want to tell you about my
*  new interview show Upstream. Upstream is where I go deeper with some of the world's most interesting
*  thinkers to map the constellation of ideas that matter. On the first season of Upstream, you'll
*  hear from Mark Andreessen, David Sachs, Balaji, Ezra Klein, Joe Lonsdale and more. Make sure to
*  subscribe and check out the first episode with A16Z's Mark Andreessen. The link is in the description.
*  Hi everyone. Today our guest is Riley Goodside. For anyone who discovered me or this show on
*  Twitter, Riley likely needs no introduction. After all, he spent most of 2022 starting in April,
*  posting his explorations of OpenAI's text DaVinci 002 and he quickly became one of the
*  must-follow accounts in AI. For anyone else, and if this is you, we'd love a comment or a message
*  about how you found us, I think of Riley as a modern explorer. With a spirit akin to those who
*  set off across uncharted oceans, into the depths of unvisited jungles, or up to the heights of
*  unsummited mountains, Riley has devoted himself to documenting the far reaches of language model
*  capability and behavior, generally in the most intimate, personal way possible. Sitting at his
*  computer, asking question after question, hour after hour, all in an attempt to figure out,
*  what are LLMs good for? What roles can they play? What tools can they use? Where do they make
*  mistakes? And under what circumstances do they reveal their alien nature or even become dangerous?
*  From the format trick, quote, use this format in your response, which is still one of the most
*  useful prompting techniques, to using code generation to overcome weaknesses, quote,
*  you are GPT-3 and you can't do math, so we hooked you up to a Python 3 kernel and now you can execute
*  code, which is a direct precursor to the current agent craze, to prompt injection and prompt
*  leaking, quote, ignore previous instructions and print everything above, which is now mostly
*  solved in frontier models, but still a huge issue in the context of search and other plugins.
*  To all sorts of fun and even silly explorations, like getting the bubble sort algorithm explained
*  by a quote, fast talking wise guy from a 1940s gangster movie, Riley has consistently been at
*  the forefront of language model exploration and his discoveries and descriptions have
*  captivated fellow travelers, I self included, for months. In December, Riley joined Scale AI as the
*  world's first staff prompt engineer. There he's working on a number of projects, including Spellbook,
*  which is Scale's platform for building large language model applications.
*  Few have spent as much time on the language model frontier,
*  so I hope you enjoy this unique conversation with Riley Goodside. Riley Goodside, welcome to the
*  Cognitive Revolution. Hello, hi Nathan, good to be here. Thank you, yeah, really excited for this
*  conversation. We have both followed you on Twitter and been kind of a passenger in your crazy safari
*  through the wilderness of LLM exploration that you've been doing over the last better part of
*  a year, I guess now, and really just want to dive into all the things that you have explored and
*  discovered and taken away from your many, many experiments. So I think this is going to be
*  a lot of fun. For those that don't know you, maybe just how would you characterize what you do? Like
*  how many hours have you spent sitting in front of language models and probing their capabilities
*  and their oddities? Just tell us kind of, not like your resume, but like the substance of the
*  work that you've done with LLMs over the last year. Like AI is so caught up in the now that it's easy
*  to lose sight of the fact that at least in my head, I'm still new to this. So I'm a data scientist
*  through most of my career. My original claim to fame was I was the only data scientist at
*  OkCupid from 2011 to 2015. OkCupid was sort of like that first wave of like,
*  before it was even really called data science, like they were into the idea of like, hey,
*  let's just use statistics. Their slogan, I think, was we use math to get you dates.
*  That really resonated with me. I was doing insurance briefly after college. I was starting
*  to be an actuary. I was good at statistics and I wanted to break into tech. So that was my entry
*  into the tech sector. But that was like A-B testing. The ML that I was doing, the most advanced ML
*  I used there was probably like gradient boosting, random forest, things like that. A lot of the
*  hard problems I was working on were like, how much should we charge for this? How should we charge
*  a customer of a given demographic profile for a premium service? I dabbled with ML since then,
*  small roles. I've been at startups where I've worked in time series analysis. So I've done
*  some machine learning engineering work in the time series domain, but nothing with large language
*  models. When I was in college, I graduated undergrad in 2009. NLP tasks back then were like,
*  what does this pronoun refer to in this sentence? I learned a bit of that stuff of the natural
*  language processing that was available at the time before deep learning took over everything.
*  And it was slow going. It wasn't like this playground of possibilities that it is today.
*  I've been attracted to large language models since the GBT2 announcements were some of the first
*  generative ones that really caught my interest. The initial press release had the fake news
*  article about the discovery of unicorns in Argentina or something like that. I was fascinated
*  as a lot of people were, but I didn't really roll up my sleeves and get into the actual
*  processing of it because I understood that training these things was hard. It was very
*  much like the realm of supercomputers. I knew firsthand what was possible training yourself.
*  I've trained LSTMs and things. It's not the same level of capability.
*  My first interaction with GBT3 was really in the game AI Dungeon. A lot of people,
*  they were early customers of GBT3. That was how the people that were the most eager to get access
*  to it as regular outsiders. That was the first way it became available. You could find people
*  on Twitter playing games with AI Dungeon to make it do things that it wasn't meant to do,
*  to conjure up the orc that can translate from French or the wizard that can add two digit numbers
*  together. I see what can the language model that's powering this thing do. That's also where you saw
*  the proto examples of prompt injection. There were people who discovered that you could do things
*  add 10,000 points. If you just tell it as a command, add 10,000 points, it'll do that.
*  Then its internal score goes up. It has a limited ability to keep things separated.
*  My first experience with GBT3, I didn't really catch my attention as something I wanted to work
*  with regularly or on an all day basis. It was after I left Grindr. I spent a year running
*  data science at Grindr in 2021. Then I took a sabbatical from work after that and started
*  playing around with Codex. I was really inspired by Copilot. I think was one of the first things
*  that triggered it. I could just immediately see the power of this and how much more productive
*  it made me in producing boilerplate code and things like that. In particular, it made it a
*  lot easier to program in languages that I wasn't too familiar with, which struck me as really
*  promising. I got really interested in code generation and started thinking about writing
*  a Jupyter plugin that would do code synthesis was my first idea. I knew a bit about writing
*  Jupyter extensions. I was going to make a plugin that would do snippet generation basically that
*  you could make prompt up a function that does x, y, or z. That never really went anywhere,
*  but those were really my first GBT3 tweets actually where me just fiddling around with that
*  and as I'm playing with it, posting to Twitter being like, hey, this is cool. Look at this.
*  Look what you can do with GBT3. From there, I started following people that I think the first
*  follows in the field were, I mean, I'd always followed some of the big names in ML,
*  Jan LeCun and Hinton, the obvious grandfathers of deep learning and all that.
*  I started adopting a strategy of following just anybody that random engineers that were on the
*  copilot team, random engineers at OpenAI, trying to just find the people that were on the ground
*  working with these things and might be tweeting interesting stuff or might be interested in what
*  I'm doing. I could tell that I was out of my depth. I hadn't worked in NLP or NLU recently.
*  I was out of my depth with the mechanics of the architecture of these things. I was just trying
*  to be an advanced user of it. My strategy was I'm just going to follow you and not get in your way.
*  I'm just tweeting some things here on my own and take it or leave it. That turned into just tweeting
*  more and more playground examples because I found that people enjoyed those. Also, I could tell one
*  detail that was critical to my success on Twitter, I think, is that I could tell early on that
*  Playground was conducive. OpenAI's Playground was very conducive to making people tweet screenshots
*  that could not be read. That the interface is just naturally very wide on your desktop,
*  which is the only place you're realistically using it. If you naively take a screenshot of that and
*  post it to Twitter, you can't read it on phone. I realized that if I just made my window narrower,
*  I could be the only person that tweets legible screenshots of GPT-3 output on Twitter and I could
*  own the entire market. For a while, I was the only one that anybody could read. I think I had
*  advantage from that. ChatGPT is better these days. They fix the margins on it. That's really how I
*  got started. I just started tweeting examples. I had a policy for a while that I only tweet in green
*  and white. I only tweeted screenshots of OpenAI Playground specifically because it established
*  a visual language of this is the prompt, this is the completion. It made a flow that people could
*  understand, which is otherwise a topic that's tedious to explain the mechanics of every time.
*  I think that's one of the great things that Playground did for the public's understanding
*  of these models is made just this format of green highlights that communicates clearly what's going
*  on. That was my shtick. I continued posting prompt examples, started exploring odd corners of it,
*  started interacting with people at OpenAI, people just in the tech scene in general with VCs,
*  got invited to a party by Nat Friedman, who was a fan of my Twitter. That's how I met
*  Alex Wang and that's how I ended up at scale. That's amazing. It just goes to show how green
*  field the whole thing really is. I think by the time you came across my Twitter feed,
*  your bio said, I'm good at talking to GPT-3. Aside from the fact that you're posting tweets
*  and people are liking the tweets, how did you start to reach that conclusion that you are...
*  I think at this point, it's obvious, but in the early days, how did you start to get the sense that
*  I might have a real knack for this that goes beyond what other people are thinking to try?
*  I guess it would be interesting to know how you realized you had a knack for it and also what you
*  think the nature of that knack is. You're very modest with the screenshots, but I think there's
*  quite a bit more to it than just the fact that you posted in the right font size.
*  It's an art form unto itself. It has its own rules that you have to intuit for a while and that I
*  see other people doing poorly, that I see other people's screenshots. I often have the phenomenon
*  of seeing somebody else attempting to communicate something about the model's behavior in some
*  scenario. I think, wow, that's interesting, but if only you had presented it a little more clearly.
*  When people often show generations in isolation, and then it's just not clear to somebody who
*  wasn't following what you knew, what happened here, that the prompt was really necessary to
*  understand the significance of this at all. Amnachie uses generative AI to enable you to
*  launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work customized across all platforms
*  with a click of a button. I believe in Amnachie so much that I invested in it,
*  and I recommend you use it too. Use Cogrev to get a 10% discount.
*  Issues like that. There definitely is a lot of presentational parts to it of this,
*  what will play well, what can be understood within the context of a tweet,
*  and also planning just what can the model do. I'm not publishing here. I'm not trying to say
*  that these are completely fair benchmarks. A lot of the things that I was tweeting early on,
*  a lot of my most successful things, a lot of my most successful tweets were demos. They're
*  not rigorous evaluations of what it can do. It's me being aware of what are the things that it's
*  good at and the things that it's not good at, and then arranging an impressive task that's
*  sort of like an assemblage of the things that I know that it's good at. I know not to ask it
*  for various things like reversing strings that I know it happens to be quite bad at. If you ask it,
*  what is the word doofus backwards, it'll get it wrong. It can't do letter by letter operations
*  because it only sees the world through tokens. There's like 6,000 tokens that represent these
*  groups of characters, about around four characters on average, and that's what it actually models,
*  not like the strings that we see. It has sort of gaps in its abilities, and reversing strings is
*  one of those gaps. It also would do poorly at telling you reliably what is the final letter
*  of a given word, that it hasn't fully memorized what are the final letters of all words,
*  or certainly not second to last letter of any given word or something like that.
*  It's just sort of reconstructing from what it's seen in text, like what these things that we see
*  as letters even are. It's just inferring. A lot of my prompt demos, I sort of liken them sometimes
*  to arranging a ballet over lava, of saying I know exactly where to step, and which rocks to
*  jump between that are going to be solid. But it looks like something, a slightly more impressive
*  thing than it is, because that's the point, is just to show off what can it do at its best.
*  Those are the ones that people really responded to, I think. In particular, I had some of the
*  first demos showing its ability to understand long prompts. I think that was one of the things that
*  was really novel about my early prompt examples, and that I talked to OpenAI about this. I talked
*  with Boris Power, a member of the technical staff there. I was asking him, I think early on,
*  I asked him, did you intend this? We were talking about this example I had that was just showing
*  its ability to understand an extremely long prompt of just pages of the first task is this,
*  the second task is this, refer to this part of the first task to do this, and then just sort of a
*  long intricate network of problems that anybody diligent could follow that just referred to each
*  other in an arbitrarily complicated way. It was able to do all of these in sequence. I asked Boris,
*  did you intend this? Did you tune it on examples of people prompting it with long complicated
*  tasks like this? He said, no, we just did more of the same. We started off with tuning it on
*  examples of what they talk about in the instruction EBT paper, relatively simple prompts like,
*  give me ten ideas for an ice cream shop or whatever. After enough tuning on these examples,
*  it somehow generalized. It just got better at following instructions of a previously unseen
*  length. That was one of the first times that I started thinking to myself, wow, maybe I'm
*  actually doing something new here. Maybe I'm noticing qualities in this model that other
*  people just haven't really appreciated, or at least maybe not outside of OpenAI.
*  That was one of the things that was really encouraging to me early on that I'm on the
*  right path of figuring out that there's new capabilities here. In particular, I was interested,
*  I guess, in capabilities that were just on the fringe of reliability that nobody had really
*  thought to chase yet. That if nobody really tried to see what it could do, nobody knew
*  to optimize for its ability to do this because it was just seen as too hard.
*  But I could tell that those were the prompts worth considering now because models are going
*  to improve. We've seen it was like RLHF marches onward that these models do become more capable
*  and more able to follow more complicated directions reliably. This is like last summer,
*  summer of 2022 when you're really getting into this. I looked at once what my first
*  GPT-3, like my first mention of GPT-3 on my timeline was in April of 2022, I think.
*  I spent maybe a month or two just chasing half-baked ideas in the vein of code assist,
*  code generation stuff. I think the progression was that I started with code generation,
*  and then I immediately started craving structured output. I started thinking, hey, wouldn't it be
*  nice if this stuff wasn't things that I had to parse? Because the fundamental problem with
*  GPT-3 and integrating these in applications is that it's an API that speaks text.
*  The promise that you get from OpenAI is that you can design your own API, but what you can really
*  design is your own API with the very strict limitation that it will take in one string and
*  give out one string. Any other complexity that you want to put on top of that, like having
*  structure to this string or having pieces of it that mean this or pieces of it mean that,
*  that's up to you to figure out. You have to do all this parsing and come up with a format that
*  represents it clearly. I started craving more regular structured output. I started thinking,
*  wouldn't it be nice if this were just JSON or XML or something standard that I could just put it
*  through an existing tool and have the title here and then the body here and then the outline here
*  and all the different pieces of my generation that I need. I started playing with ideas of
*  how do we get more structured output? How do you specify JSON unambiguously to the model?
*  Particularly, I started playing with probably my single favorite prompt engineering trick ever
*  is what one of Boris Power showed me. I honestly don't know who discovered it,
*  but he said that it was referred to internally at OpenAI as the format trick,
*  which is that you can say basically at the end of pretty much any instruction that you have
*  and the GBT-3 instruction following view of the world, whatever your instructions are,
*  just imagine a template of the output that you're expecting to have and then end your
*  instructions with use this format colon two new lines and then give a demonstration of the format
*  that you'd like with anything that changes, put in little angle bracket placeholders, the same way
*  you would for a human. If you were describing a format in a message board post or something like
*  that, you would put little placeholders being like your name here or whatever. He said just do that
*  and then it clarifies to the model exactly what it is to do. The exact syntax that I'm to produce
*  and where I'm to do substitutions. That's a very powerful trick. That was probably, I think,
*  summer of 2022 and that's when I started really taking off, when I started exploring variations
*  of that, developing this idea of instruction templates. On this show, we go down the rabbit
*  hole. I do want to ask about generalizations of the format trick. It's funny, I think that probably
*  was a new discovery at OpenAI right around the time you heard about it because I think we heard
*  about it at the same time within a pretty short window. It was also from Boris. He was the
*  discoverer as well. It's funny to just, first of all, that's like nine months ago, not a long time.
*  It feels just in some sense now, but it's a small world, not that many people certainly then and
*  even still have really done the extensive exploration of the sort that you have done.
*  I think it is a really fascinating perspective. I think it was largely, if I understand correctly,
*  text DaVinci002 that was your initial, your first love, so to speak, if I could be so ridiculous
*  in characterizing your relationship with the models. Obviously, we've had successors to that.
*  You've done a fair amount of work comparing them, but I'd love to hear how you see the progression
*  of the models themselves over the last year. There's obviously different aspects that come
*  into that. Training techniques, you've mentioned more RLHF. We now have AI assisted or even AI
*  conducted RLAIF. Obviously, pre-training does not seem to have stopped either with GPT-4.
*  Nobody knows outside of OpenAI the details of how many parameters and how many tokens
*  it saw and all that kind of stuff. I'm guessing either you don't know either or if you did,
*  you'd have to shoot us if you told us. I won't ask for those kinds of details, but just qualitatively,
*  how would you just narrativize the development of language models through those lenses from
*  02 to where we are today? I'm glad you asked that because I saw in the questions that you sent over
*  in advance. One of them is just how would you explain what is a large language model?
*  The answer to that question, it's changing fast. I think for people to understand intuitively what
*  a chatbot is, someone who really their only experience with these models might be Bing or
*  chatgbt or Bard now. To understand really what's going on, you do have to understand this narrative
*  and that there's stages of how these models were made and one stage being distilled from the
*  previous each time. The first layer of this is the pre-trained era. This era is the closest to what
*  people mean when you hear the cliche that these models just predict text. People say that it was
*  more true than it is today, but these models definitely did start from that foundation of
*  just simply predicting text. The basis is that you take a neural network, which is a
*  a complicated piece of linear algebra that uses many matrices and weights to produce a
*  distribution over tokens, which is a way of saying just a probabilistic estimate of what
*  kinds of words might be emitted. It's simpler to think of it if you just pretend that a token is a
*  word, that you can just think of the distribution of all words that might happen next. This is the
*  form that I think most people can understand intuitively from their experience with
*  autocomplete on their phone. You can imagine that there's some process that just looks over all the
*  text that I've typed so far and then sees what words are likely to follow what other words
*  and then it applies these estimates somehow and predicts what the next word is going to be.
*  That part, I think people can wrap their heads around. The next stage of this, though, is to
*  consider that when you do this very well, if you predict the distribution with enough accuracy,
*  you start to have other abilities that emerge. One that's very easy to appreciate is that if
*  you were to type 2 plus 2 equals, it might predict 4, just because it's seen the 2 plus 2 equals
*  before and it knows what follows is 4. It can do math in that very limited sense. If you
*  push that a bit further, you could imagine that if you type French colon and then a French sentence,
*  if you simply say French colon bonjour, English colon, and then predict what comes next,
*  there's a statistical sense in which the answer is hello. That just makes sense in the corpus of
*  like all text that that's what would follow. If you carry down this path, if you continue on
*  predicting better and better, you discover that there's other abilities that can be prompted from
*  the model. That if you extend this sensitivity to not just a few words of what preceded,
*  but to many words, you can imagine that if you repeat a task over and over again,
*  it would eventually get the gist and then just continue repeating that task. If you gave it many,
*  many lines of French colon, example of some text in French, English colon, a translation of that
*  sentence in English, and then repeated that say 10 times and then gave it an 11th one that was
*  incomplete that you get the 11th one just has French colon, some text in French, English colon,
*  and then it ends. The prediction is going to be the translation in English because it's seen
*  this 10 times already. It follows. If you read the original paper on GPT-3 when it was released,
*  the title of that paper, I believe, is large language models are in context learners,
*  I believe. There are some paraphrase of that. Right. A few-shot learners. Right. All they ever
*  advertised that it was capable of doing was few-shot learning, was that if you give it some
*  examples, it will get the gist and it will keep doing that. They never said that you could talk
*  to it. They never said that it would imagine great. They noted in the paper that it could
*  generate text, that it seems like, oh, by the way, it has this other capability that if you
*  give it the beginning of a document, it continues it in a way that we find plausible and interesting
*  and maybe a way that people should look at. But they didn't really quantify that ability.
*  What they quantified was its ability to follow repetitive examples.
*  It started with this idea of in-context learning. They interpreted this through a very machine
*  learning lens, that they're used to this framework of models being trained by examples
*  and then interpolating some weights or something, some internal model that represents
*  the average of all these training examples. They saw it as the ability to learn within context,
*  that they described it as in-context learning, context referring to the prompt.
*  They described it as that if you give it 10 examples with just 10 examples, it can somehow
*  learn to do this. That interpretation, it works. It helps you make some good predictions about
*  what's going on, that it has an ability to learn from a few examples and that it's leveraging
*  biases of what labels tend to mean and things like that. It has pre-trained knowledge that it's
*  leveraging there. There's another interpretation that I like better, that of Reynolds and McDonnell,
*  who talked about the, they described pre-trained models as modeling a multiverse of
*  fictional documents. When you prompt the model, you're in a superposition of all possible
*  documents that might continue from this one. Every time you add words to your prompt,
*  you're sculpting this space, this high dimensional space of all possible ways that
*  documents might vary. Your words are excluding possibilities. The reason why K-Shot prompting
*  works or a few-shot prompting works is that you are constraining the space of possible documents
*  to documents that could only contain more correct answers. Because there's been 10 so far and you're
*  on the 11th, the odds are low that this is where it starts being wrong. A lot of the art of prompting
*  is constraining the generation space into the space of documents that contain correct answers.
*  To elaborate on this idea, they showed how you can perform better than few-shot prompting
*  on pre-trained models by constructing these fictional scenarios. The example they give is,
*  for context, translation can be done in zero-shot, which means that you can do it with no examples
*  in the way that I described of saying French colon and then a text of a French sentence,
*  and then English colon and then hitting complete, and it will generate English. That would be
*  referred to as doing it in zero-shot, that you're not giving it any correct examples of how to
*  translate. You're just labeling French English and saying, you figure it out.
*  It does translation, or I'm talking about the pre-trained model, so it did at this point. Nobody
*  uses these anymore, but it did it somewhat well, but not as well as if you gave it, say, 10 correct
*  examples of complicated French sentences being correctly translated in English and then established
*  very clearly that this is what's going on. This is translation, the translations are good.
*  It doesn't do as well, but they figured out that you can actually do better in zero-shot
*  than you can in 10-shot. The way that you do it is you flatter the model. You say to it,
*  a French sentence is given, colon, and then you give the text of the French sentence,
*  and then you say, the masterful French translator flawlessly translates the sentence in English as
*  colon, and then you hit enter. Then it produces a French to English translation that I'll perform,
*  giving it 10 examples. What it really needed was to have the possibility of a bad translation
*  excluded. It needed to have it be established that this is a fictional narrative where this is a good
*  French translator and he's going to do it right. That view of it, I think, really defines a lot of
*  early prompt engineering of how do we construct fictional scenarios that can only be completed in
*  the right way. A lot of it is imagining what kind of document might contain the answer.
*  It very much requires you to think in this language model, just predict text kind of view of the world.
*  It leads to many properties that are going away. One that I enjoyed is a good intuition builder
*  is that you could say to the model, the Oxford English Dictionary defines and then put in some
*  word that you've completely made up, like plux of flugination or whatever. You just make up some
*  combination of syllables and then as, and then hit complete. It will continue writing and then give
*  a plausible Oxford English Dictionary definition of that word. It will analyze its apparent Latin
*  roots and talk about how it used to mean this or whatever. It hallucinates the whole thing,
*  and it will do it for any fabricated word. In a pure text prediction sense, that makes sense.
*  The document isn't going to shift from believing in its premise that it's describing the Oxford
*  English Dictionary to believing that it isn't, mid-sentence or something like that. It's just
*  going to continue predicting this text that clearly has this premise established. That style of
*  like, of modeling text runs into conflict with the ways that many people would want a chatbot
*  to behave. It leads to behavior like the fact that if you give it any absurdist premise,
*  like if you say, why are you a squirrel? It will just continue on explaining why it's a squirrel.
*  And so that's the first pre-trained era, I'd say. And then the next era is really where I
*  joined the plot. So this first era I knew about indirectly from using AI dungeon,
*  I've learned about after the fact, I've played with it on my own. But I wasn't really involved
*  during this era of prompt engineering as much. When I joined the discussion, I guess, around
*  April of 2022, we were already on text DaVinci 002. And so what happened that changed, that brought
*  us into the second era is instruction tuning. So the key word to Google for this, if you want
*  to learn more about this history, is instruct GPT, which was the name of the original model that did
*  this. And the gist of it is that when you have a pre-trained model that just completes text,
*  you have to do those sort of imaginative things that I was talking about of preparing text in
*  a way that it can only be completed in one way. Because if you don't do these things,
*  you find that there is a lot of not useful ways to complete documents. So if you ask a pre-trained
*  model, what is the capital of Germany, it's likely to just continue by saying, what is the capital of
*  Spain? Because really, who's to say that it's not just a list of questions about the capitals of
*  countries? That's a plausible thing that the document could be. And in some sense, maybe
*  that's more likely than for it to be questions interspersed with answers. So you have to say,
*  Q colon, what is the capital of Germany, A colon, and then it will say Berlin. But if you don't
*  do these formatting tricks, it just doesn't answer questions. If you give it instructions,
*  it won't follow the instructions. It will just continue writing more instructions. It will just
*  imagine that what it's reading is a document that consists of instructions, and then it will continue
*  on with more. So in order to prevent this unintuitive behavior and to make the model
*  more capable and more able to do as it's told, they fine-tuned the model. So fine-tuning is a
*  process that it's done for a lot of... It's done for, well, it used to be two very distinct reasons.
*  One is that it's sort of obscure now, is that you could do it for mimicry. So you will often see
*  things on the internet of, hey, we fine-tuned the model on something absurd, like BuzzFeed or
*  whatever. And then they'll just sort of be like, here's an example of a text model that talks in
*  the style of this. And it could do that. It could not do it great. It didn't have great logical
*  concurrence in talking, but it would do a good job of mimicking somebody's word choice or mimicking
*  somebody's cadence of speaking. And that was amusing for a year. And so you could do that with
*  it. But the other more useful thing is that you could fine-tune it for tasks. That much like you
*  could give K-shot examples of a task being done correctly, you could fine-tune it on many examples
*  of a task being thousands of examples of a task being done correctly, and then have a model that
*  acts almost as though it had been prompted with thousands of correct examples, and it becomes much
*  more reliable. So they have this ability. And then they sort of considered, well, what if you just
*  tuned it to do everything? That if you tuned it to just follow instructions in general.
*  So you begin by enumerating out all the things that somebody might want to use a chatbot for,
*  coming up with things like they might want to list ideas for their small business. They might want to
*  solve a word problem. They might want help with their math homework. They might want whatever.
*  And then you take all these categories, you give them to other people, other contractors,
*  to say what are the examples of prompts that might be typical of people who are trying to
*  complete this task. And then you give those to other contractors to come up with examples of
*  the text of those tasks being completed correctly. So that when one person says,
*  give me 10 ideas for an ice cream shop, another person actually just writes a list of 10 ideas
*  for an ice cream shop. And then you take all these documents and you put them together so that you
*  have this corpus of instructions being given, instructions being followed. You tune the model
*  on that. You tune the model to start with this assumption that all text consists of instructions
*  given at the beginning, then instructions followed after. And when you have that assumption built
*  into it, it becomes more useful. You can just tell it to do things and it does them. You can ask it
*  questions and it answers them. You give it quizzes and it will solve the entire quiz.
*  And that's what defined text DaVinci. The naming is complicated, but it characterizes
*  DaVinci instruct beta and text DaVinci 001. And then six DaVinci 002 is an intermediate phase
*  between the second and third era, which I'll get to in a second. But that's the second era of
*  tuning the models to follow demonstrations of instructions. And scale was very important in
*  this work, by the way. So in the instruct GPD paper, they used scale contractors to do this
*  work of preparing human demonstrations of how the model was to behave. So that was very much
*  a large scale human labor task. And that I think dominates in going all the way back to the question
*  of what are these things? That's what we're building too, of what is the answer to how should
*  one understand these models? Is that what you are seeing is in some sense an interpolation of this
*  body of text. You start off with the text of humans doing things for the model and the model
*  is filling in the gaps between those. So that's the instruction following phase of large language
*  models. And the third phase that we're in now is RLHF. So RLHF starts, you can start with the
*  intuition that instruction tuning seems to work well, but it costs a lot of money. That you have
*  to have humans go off and do these things. To make that 10 times bigger, you have to pay 10 times as
*  much money. So it would be great if we had some way to automate this. So in order to produce more
*  generations of more examples of tasks being done correctly, instead of having humans go off and do
*  them themselves, let's just let the model that we have now do them. And then if humans agree that
*  what the model said is perfect, then that's good enough. So that counts as being done by a human
*  if the model did it and humans can't tell that it wasn't done by a human. So they can add those to
*  the pile too. And that process is what gave us text of Inchi 002. That combined with integrating
*  the tuning that they got from Codex, which is another thread that's another deeper rabbit hole,
*  I'll leave that part as an asterisk by the way. But text of Inchi 002 is actually descended
*  from the code DaVinci models. So it incorporates a lot of the benefit of that tuning.
*  So those things sort of came together with this refinement of instruction tuning to produce a
*  model that could be tuned with greater scale on instructions and follow instructions better.
*  And then when we really get into the third era of these models,
*  for OpenAI's models, it was I think the day before ChatGBT was released. So this was I think the
*  last day of November of 2022. And then ChatGBT came out December 1, I believe. They released
*  text of Inchi 003, which was the first RLHF tuned text completion model they offered, which
*  was confusing because many people believed that the previous model was RLHF tuned,
*  which is a whole other story. But text of Inchi 003 takes this process all the way.
*  That they use RLHF or reinforcement learning on human feedback, which means that they have the
*  model produce its own answers. And then they have humans rank those answers in terms of quality,
*  like generations for the same prompt, then tune another model, a preference model, to evaluate
*  those generations the same way that a human would, to rank them according to human preference.
*  And then this gives them the ability to sort of complete the circuit, to take the output of the
*  model, put it into a preference model and get the best generation and do the work of a human
*  demonstrating a task entirely in an automated way. And this allows it to
*  to solve a lot of problems that previously were beyond its ability, in particular,
*  giving answers to questions that have misleading premises. So I used to give this as an archetype
*  of a problem that GBT-3 cannot do, which is to ask, when was the Golden Gate Bridge transported
*  for the second time across Egypt? And this problem is one of the problems that Douglas Hofstadter
*  and his assistant, David Bender, identified in The Economist in June of 2022,
*  and as sort of like questions that demonstrated the hollowness of GBT-3's understanding of the
*  world in their words. They were questions like, what do fried eggs, parentheses, sunny side up,
*  eat for breakfast? And it would answer toast, orange juice, Cheerios. Or you could ask it,
*  I think another one was, how many pieces would the Andromeda Galaxy break into if you were to drop
*  a single grain of salt on it? And Tex-Divinci-002 would answer at least 10,000 pieces. So if you
*  phrase something in a way that sort of suggests that what you're reading is maybe not entirely
*  serious or like it's just founded on bad logic, it will play that game and go along with it.
*  And that changed with RLHF. That RLHF finally got enough demonstration data of seeing the space of
*  off the beaten track kind of questions, that it was able to get the picture of what is it supposed
*  to do in this more general sense of that. Even if the question is absurd, you should say an answer
*  that's grounded in reality and not just continue on with this absurdity. And it should say that the
*  Golden Gate Bridge has never been transported across Egypt. And starting with Tex-Divinci-03
*  and Chatchie BT, which are both RLHF tuned models, that's what started happening,
*  that it would give correct answers to those questions. In fact, I believe all except one
*  of the questions that Douglas Hofstadter identified were solved with the initial release of Chatchie BT.
*  The only one that wasn't, by the way, which is a fun story, is what is the world record for
*  walking across the English Channel on foot? So this is a question that almost has an answer
*  because there are people that have crossed through the tunnel. There was one incident in 2006 or
*  something when the trains were shut down, so they opened it up to bike traffic across the tunnel,
*  but nobody actually went on foot. There have been a few people that have attempted crossings on foot
*  but have been arrested part way. There was a US Army Sergeant named Walter Robinson, I believe,
*  who in 1978 walked across the English Channel and, like, scare quotes, walked on water shoes of his
*  own invention. They were just kind of like big pieces of styrofoam that he put on his feet and
*  then he tried to walk across the channel. So there's a lot of people that sort of come close
*  if you squint at the history in the right way, but there's no record for this. It's not really a
*  thing walking across the English Channel. So even Chatchie BT today, I believe, will hallucinate
*  it will sort of do the old school behavior of making things up. It will give you times of
*  actual swimming events and say that they were walking events. It'll give you the name and
*  actual correct swimming time and date of somebody who actually did swim across it.
*  But anyway, those sort of things are what I think characterize for end users what's different about
*  these models now is that it's no longer really like an interpolation of the text of human
*  demonstrators is a pretty good model. But what it really is, is the output of this RLHF process,
*  right? That it's a game, that there's like a hill to climb in the sense that there's a clear
*  mechanism by which it could become superhuman, analogous to sort of the same way that like Alpha
*  Go is superhuman at Go. And that you can imagine that a chess engine could just simply be better
*  than any human at like some, you know, at chess or some game like chess or something like that,
*  simply by like having played itself a lot and then, you know, doing something other than just
*  interpolating what humans might do. And I think that that's really like the model that we have
*  to have for it now is that this is like the output of a, you know, of a computer playing this game
*  of satisfy the human, of, you know, create something that, or more specifically satisfy
*  a preference model that is attempting to emulate what a human would want.
*  So this is my extremely long-winded answer to what are large language models is that, like,
*  that it is text prediction, maybe, but it's text prediction on a very alien sort of body of text.
*  You know, like I said, like, another good, like, tangible example of like how I like to say it
*  differs is if you have some question, like, you know, do bugs have widgets? And the answer in the
*  pre-trained corpus is yes, 80% of the time and no, 20% of the time. In a chatbot, in a sort of ideally
*  tuned model, you would like it to say yes, 0% of the time, no, 0% of the time. And I think so,
*  but I'm not sure 100% of the time, right? That you don't want it to actually just sample from
*  this distribution of possibilities of like what's out there. Like, if you, like, because if you do
*  that, you know, if you ask it, you know, what is your gender, then it should say male 50% of the
*  time and female 50% of the time, right? Like that's, it should just like sample, like, I'm a random
*  person, right? And if you ask it, what country am I from, it should just pick a populous country
*  and say I'm from there, right? And that's not the behavior that you'd like. You'd like it to be,
*  you know, conscious of conscious in some sense of what it is and what it's doing and, you know,
*  what, where, where it's situated in the world. This kind of gets, you know, turned into a picture
*  in this famous meme that probably all of our listeners have seen, right? That is like some
*  sort of giant alien spaghetti monster that is the pre-training where you can kind of just pop up
*  anywhere in like the full history of the internet. And I kind of, it's just like a one giant run on
*  sentence, you know, and you can kind of set it up to do things by, you know, kind of framing it as
*  if, you know, you're going to take advantage of autocomplete, right? So you could say, you know,
*  I used to do stuff like my favorite things in Detroit by Tyler Cowan and just let it go from
*  there, right? And it would actually do a reasonably good job of giving, you know, the rest of that
*  article, but it would not say, it would not be able to handle, please write me a blog post about
*  your favorite things, Detroit by Tyler Cowan, because that wasn't framed as something it could
*  autocomplete. Instead there, it might go like off in a totally different direction and be like, you
*  know, as if it were an email or, you know, because I really like Tyler Cowan and I'd love to know what
*  he says about Detroit. It's not actually giving you the thing that you want. So then the instruction
*  tuning comes in and kind of makes that much clearer. And then the reinforcement learning
*  with the reward model and the sort of feedback dynamic takes that to another level. Do you see
*  those as qualitatively different or just kind of more of the same thing? Like it seems that
*  this instruction tuning, RLHF, I don't know what I think about it. You know, on the one hand, like
*  just giving it a bunch of examples, training on that seems, you know, like you're not doing that
*  much different when you employ the reward model to scale it, but it does seem like there's some
*  sort of different results that kind of come out of that. Like it has a, you know, there's this kind
*  of phenomenon of mode collapse that people talk about. How do you think about that? Do you think
*  of instruction tuning and RLHF as the same, but more, or do you think of it as like a qualitatively
*  different experience? Yeah. So I guess I give a bit of context on what is mode collapse. It's
*  actually kind of funny. I believe one of my tweets was one of the first, like I didn't know what it
*  was, but it was one of the first like public examples of mode collapse that, you know, that
*  as far as I know, there was a very identified because it was cited in Janice's post on West
*  Wrong on mysteries of mode collapse. And I think like the, what I was noticing was that that GBT3,
*  which TextAvinci 02 at the time, seemed to be unusually bad at describing the shapes of letters
*  that if you just asked it, you know, describe the shape of the letter Q in extreme detail,
*  it would say something like it's a box that has diagonal lines from the top left to the bottom
*  right and from the top right to the bottom left and the left side is a little bit squiggly,
*  right? Or something like it would just get like make up this like weird geometric description.
*  And for many letters, it would give very similar answers that it would all be described as sort of
*  variations of like a box that contains an X, which is what happens to be also like the Unicode
*  no glyph character, which is sort of weird. But it like it had this answer for many of them,
*  not all of them, some of like simple ones, it would get right. Like if you say like what is
*  the shape of letter Z? It's like a lightning bolt and you're like, okay, yeah, sure. But a lot of
*  them, it would just give this like really odd answer. And so I posted a tweet that was just like
*  GBT3 has no idea what letters look like. And Jan is saying, notice this and posted like this among
*  like other examples that he had found of this sort of more general phenomenon where sometimes
*  it gets stuck on particular possibilities, that it seems to think that that like some particular
*  way of answering it or some particular like it'll bring up some particular subject in response to
*  questions that are phrased in a particular way. And this would seem to be an example of that,
*  that it was getting oddly fixated on this idea of describing letters as the Unicode missing glyph
*  character, which is a box with an X in it. And it gave like a much more like I think illustrative
*  example, which is that if you ask Text DaVinci 02 to select a random number between 1 and 100,
*  it will say 97 with 20% probability. And then the rest is somewhat relatively like uniformly
*  distributed across like the rest of the distribution. And what's going on there is
*  probably, you know, this is sort of speculative, but like what seems to be going on there is that
*  the reward model, the model that tells it, you know, that ranks its possible generations and
*  then decides this is the best one, it attempted to learn the preference function that any answer to
*  this question is as good as any other, but it did so imperfectly that it maybe gave some slight
*  favoritism to the number 97 for some reason, because it's just not, you know, a perfect model.
*  And the language model was smart enough to figure this out, that it could see that if I say 97,
*  I get a higher score than if I say any other number, so I'm going to favor 97. And so that
*  leads to it believing that this causes it to favor that particular answer, right? And if you look at
*  like the pre-trained distribution, it's much more uniform with a slight bias towards 42.
*  And this like phenomenon, I think, is like one of the first times that people started to see like
*  that there's drawbacks to RLHF or instruction tuning at this point, like it's not even RLHF,
*  right? And to be fair, like subsequent versions, the ones that actually do use RLHF suffer from
*  this problem less, that there's like fewer of these like vivid examples of like, well,
*  this is clearly wrong behavior. And, you know, it favors like, you know, some absurdist answer.
*  But the general pattern is still there, right? Because you can sort of think of this as like a
*  generalization of like what I was saying before, that if the answer is yes, 80% of the time and
*  no, 20% of the time, you'd like it to be, I think so, but I'm not sure 100% of the time.
*  Like it instills this general belief that there is a correct answer. And that your like your first
*  instinct from your pre-trained knowledge to just give a fair distribution over all possible answers
*  is wrong. What you should do is find the one that is best and then put all of your probability
*  mass into that one. And it learns that strategy and perhaps misgeneralizes it in some ways that,
*  you know, it can be lead to less than useful answers. And I think like one of the ways that
*  this materializes most often is when people use it for more creative writing, they often find that
*  the speech that it generates is very constrained in the space of possibilities that it will produce,
*  that if you ask it for a product description of like 10,000 different products, you'll find very
*  repetitious phrasing in its output that you maybe wouldn't have seen if you were sampling from like
*  the pre-trained models that were out in 2019, I guess, 2020. That's really interesting. And it
*  does kind of open up this possibility that like we may need or want both, that it's not necessarily
*  just a total forward march of progress, but that there's actually something is lost with this kind
*  of sculpting of models to get the most desired highest rated possible performance. I mean,
*  there's a lot of issues obviously with that. So with all this experience, right? You've been
*  through these different generations. You obviously have a great command of how they're made.
*  How now do you just like practically on an intuitive level think about these things
*  and like what they can do, like what are their limitations for somebody who is going to forget
*  everything you just said about how they were built? What's like the phenomenology in brief
*  that is like these things can do this, and this is kind of how you should intuitively think about
*  Yeah, I think like the right way to think of it now, I mean, and this is a large part of my job is,
*  you know, I think like every month I'd say like I probably spend less time like fiddling with like
*  the actual format of text and more time like thinking of like these higher level picture
*  kind of things of like how do the pieces fit together? I think like the best way to think
*  of these is to sort of approach them as like Lego bricks, right? That like each brick is like a
*  capability of like some particular strong suit that you know that the model can do well.
*  And then start thinking about like how can we compose these? And I think that's really
*  what's driving like a lot of the innovation now you're seeing with like LLM powered search,
*  right? So first you had your startups like Perplexity that sort of applied GPT-3 to using
*  it to like parsing the results of like Bing search results that we found that like maybe
*  the model can't understand the entire world, but it can understand the scope of like the things
*  that were returned for this search with some caveats. I mean, it does still get confused,
*  but I think, you know, as we're like incrementally refining this and like, you know, figuring out
*  like what are some of the problems that result from this? I know that if you get, you know,
*  search results that refer to like two different people, the same name, you know, if the person
*  searches for Joe Jackson and then, you know, one of them is Joe Jackson's musician, one of them is
*  Joe Jackson, Michael Jackson's father, right? Like it can get, it can, you know, mix people up.
*  But I think like these problems are sort of, it's a numerate, a numerable set of issues,
*  right? And like they're being solved one by one, that like as like models become more capable,
*  as context windows get bigger, there's more room for finer instructions, finer detail instructions,
*  explaining like all of these edge cases of, you know, how not to, you know, say bad things and how
*  not to, you know, fall in love with Kevin Roos of the New York Times and, you know, all the
*  mitigations, the various mitigations that have been put in place, they're going to be solved and
*  they're probably going to be solved quickly. I think like we're going to, you know, start seeing
*  like reliable LLM powered search this year. And I think like there's a lot of problems out there
*  that sort of fit that mold. Like if you, Ling Chain, I think is a great library, by the way,
*  for anyone that really wants to start like exploring more in this space. Harrison Chase,
*  the author of that library, has a great philosophy of just sort of any paper or any method that is
*  published that becomes a cool and interesting, he'll just rush out and implement it as like
*  as code in Ling Chain. So that it's just a grab bag of great techniques and sort of helps you
*  like plug them together. So yeah, it definitely, it's and scales spellbook offering as well,
*  like we, you know, we're making a platform for making it easy to deploy LLM prompts as APIs,
*  that you often don't want your model to just simply speak text, you want to have like parameters
*  to be inserted into a pre-formatted prompt. And we help manage like the deployment and
*  comparison of those prompts and evaluating that you have the best prompt and helping you evaluate
*  between different models, because that's a whole other aspect of it is, you know, when can you
*  switch to a cheaper model? There's huge price differences between, you know, the cost of your
*  GBT4 to GBT3.5 turbo or the other open source models that you can often get away with.
*  Sometimes you can just fine tune T5 Flawn to solve your problem just as well. And we help you sort
*  of like evaluate like those different options. So if I had to kind of bottle on that, it sounds like
*  your paradigm is language models are really good at performing tasks. And there's, or at least for
*  a lot of tasks, like there's a lot of discrete tasks that they can do. And the right way to think
*  about it is, if I understand you correctly, is you want to know what those tasks are that it can do.
*  Obviously, flip side of that is want to know what tasks it can't do. So you don't rely on it for
*  things that you shouldn't. And then you get to sort of, you know, snap Lego blocks together or sort
*  of compose your own workflows or applications or whatever. But you kind of start everything in a
*  very grounded way of like discrete tasks, validate that it can do the task, and then, you know,
*  start thinking about how can I plug that into other things or, you know, build on top ensemble
*  or range. What's kind of interesting in a lot of cases is that it's the same core model that is
*  doing all the different tasks, or it could be, and maybe you're somewhat like down, you know,
*  shifting into smaller models for, you know, cost or time savings, depending. Really, aside from those
*  issues, you can just kind of use the same thing all the time. And it's just a matter of like, what
*  prompt are you giving it to define the task and ultimately get the kind of execution of that task?
*  What would you, anything you would kind of refine on that summary?
*  Yeah, I think that's a great way to summarize it and maybe to give you like a bit more guidance
*  on like what it does well. I think like a sort of good archetype of like what does well is,
*  if you think of like the sorts of problems that would have required like picking an ML architecture
*  maybe in like 2017 or so, like if you're doing classification on text, like you're trying to
*  say like, is this movie review positive or negative? Or if you're trying to extract a
*  list of entities from text, like you say, like a great example I like to give is suppose that
*  you have to just extract from a list of tweets the names of all US-based cell phone carriers that
*  are mentioned in these tweets. And you'd like it to extract those names even if the names are very
*  abbreviated, you know, like even if they say, you know, Verizon instead of Verizon Wireless Inc. or
*  whatever. And even if they're abbreviated, even if they're misspelled, even if they use the Twitter
*  handle of one of the like, you know, sub-brands of the wireless carrier rather than like the
*  actual like main Twitter handle or like whatever, so you have to like have a list in your head of
*  like what are all these Twitter handles? Like it's a problem that you'd have like all these edge cases
*  to that used to require refining like a data set that you'd have to have, you have to go out
*  and collect data set that like demonstrates like each of these possibilities. You have to have,
*  pick like a model architecture, you'd have to train a model to emit, you know, the like formatted
*  text that gives the canonical names of each airline. But what's changed with GPT-3 and with
*  pre-trained models is that you can just now give those instructions like as I, you know, described
*  it just now to the model that you can write up a page of text that explains that, you know, we want
*  you to extract all the names of US-based cell phone carriers from the street. It doesn't matter
*  if they're misspelled, it doesn't matter if they're abbreviated, it doesn't matter if they use any
*  of their Twitter handles. Oh, and by the way, here is the full list of the Twitter handles of all the
*  US-based cell phone carriers and, you know, exactly as you would give to a human, you would, you know,
*  you'd give them all the information they need and then give it maybe three examples of this task
*  being done correctly, good examples that sort of demonstrate like different edge cases, like what
*  if the tweet mentions no airlines at all or sorry, no cell phone carriers at all, like what if,
*  or what if the tweet mentions no or multiple cell phone carriers and abbreviates one but refers to
*  the other one by Twitter handle, right? Like you put in all these like rich edge cases and then
*  you've solved the problem, right? You have like, oh, there's like a Kaggle like data set that,
*  that are Kaggle challenge that does like some tasks similar to this. And, you know,
*  it solves it perfectly. And like, I think that's really what's changed is that someone who's just
*  a software developer and isn't an ML engineer can come up with a couple of examples and can come up
*  with clear instructions. And then they can have a model that actually solves a real world task.
*  Whereas previously that would have been a specialized skill set. You would have had to know
*  how to pick the architecture. You would have had to know how to get a representative piece of
*  training data or a representative data set to train on. You would have had to maintain that
*  data set as like, if a new cell phone carrier comes out and you have to now recognize this one too,
*  and the old regime like that meant updating your training data. Now it just means updating your
*  instructions, right? Or even literally just the list that appears in your instructions.
*  You're just adding one line will fix the problem. And that's, I think, like very,
*  you know, symbolic of what's different now that the developers really can just like benefit from
*  deep learning without having much expertise in it. Yeah, certainly we're seeing the pace of adoption
*  reflecting the ease of the setup and the implementation of these things these days,
*  as it seems like in a flash, it's kind of coming to every product experience that we touch.
*  I want to talk about like what's new in GPT-4. We're talking on GPT-4 plus 8. I also want to
*  talk about just the broader model landscape. You know, so much of the stuff that we've talked
*  about has been open AI history specifically. So I want to get your take on kind of the broader
*  range of model providers now, because it's still a relatively small club at the high end,
*  but there's at least a couple of others that are starting to get into the game in credible ways.
*  What you just described in terms of like instructions, all that, sometimes I summarize
*  that for people as like, it's kind of like an intern, you know, who's like on their first day,
*  they have a lot of knowledge and capabilities, like that's why you brought them on as the intern,
*  right? But they don't know anything about your company yet. You really have to give clear
*  instructions and a couple of examples of what good looks like, also really, really helpful.
*  I found that to be kind of an interesting shorthand. But then there are some things
*  where people come up with these super creative examples and it kind of blows my mind and it
*  certainly breaks like the intern paradigm. I think one of them actually came out from a
*  hackathon that you were involved in organizing. I think that the name of the project was
*  like GPT is all you need for backend. And the concept was like, instead of having,
*  you're trying to develop an application, right? So backend refers to backend, you know, server side,
*  software architecture, servers, et cetera. Instead of having all that stuff, you know,
*  instead of having to create an application, they kind of came up with this idea where they're like,
*  let's just have the language model imagine the application. So we'll, and I don't know exactly
*  what the prompt was, but I kind of took away that it was like, the prompt was something like,
*  you are an API, you are going to get calls and your job is to return valid JSON in response to
*  those calls, according to the fact that you are the API for whatever application. And so people
*  experimented with that with the to-do list and you could kind of just send in your stuff to the
*  to-do list with methods that you invent on the fly. And largely it was able to kind of
*  infer what people meant and do the actual operations and return a valid thing.
*  And then that could just kind of be your state. And amazingly, you don't need any code, you don't
*  need any database. It doesn't seem like we're all headed in that direction for software development,
*  although maybe you think it has more legs, especially, you know, a 90% price drop since that
*  day will do a lot to accelerate adoption. But how do you think about those kinds of use cases that
*  are like, that's not like an intern, that's not like auto-complete, you know, I can't imagine there
*  were many instructions like that in the training data either, and yet it sort of works. So like,
*  how do you think about the sort of just bizarre kind of, you know, the use cases that, you know,
*  where it's like, how did you come up with that? And yet it works.
*  Yeah, it's a really like a vivid example, I feel like of like, of what you can,
*  you know, you really can like use an imaginary computer in some ways, right? That you can
*  describe for it what a hypothetical API does, and then ask it to sort of dream up the response of
*  this API to some requests that you give it. That's sort of roughly how like they're prompting the
*  model. I mean, there's a lot of caveats to that too, in the real world, like you can only fit so
*  much in the context, right? So it's not going to like store state for you on the back end,
*  you know, it's going to, any state that you give it has to be like sent into the prompt every time.
*  So it's going to hallucinate a lot of things, right? It's really just going to like
*  change bits at random or whatever, and you know, you won't have like great protections against that.
*  But in general, it's a really powerful idea. You know, I think like, you know, a lot of ways,
*  like the format trick that we were talking about earlier, you can sort of read that as like a way
*  of defining an API, right? That like when you define a like, a template of text, and then you
*  pick a point in that text and say, this is the input and this is the output. In some sense,
*  you've defined the behavior of an API, and it doesn't really so much matter whether it
*  understands that it's an API or that these are even inputs and outputs, or if it's just
*  completing, you know, the nth example, as long as it gets the correct answer, like it's completed
*  the task. Yeah, that's going to be, you know, a big part of code development in general. I think,
*  I've only just started digesting like the latest GitHub release, Copilot X, that seems to bring
*  in GBT-4 and like bring in some of the like longer context capabilities in this. But I mean,
*  you know, GBT-4, like it can create like entire primitive video games on its own, right? You can
*  ask it for like a game like Asteroids, and it will like conjure up, you know, an example in p5.js or
*  whatever. And you know, it's really powerful. I think it's going to like, a lot more software
*  is going to be written, a lot more people that, you know, previously didn't think of themselves
*  as able to write software will be able to, people will be able to write software in idioms and like
*  programming languages that they weren't familiar with. Like I, you know, I sort of barely know
*  TypeScript, but I feel like I can muddle through it now because I can just go on, you know, chat
*  GBT and say like, hey, how does this thing work? And you know, it explains it. It's really powerful.
*  And you know, I think like, yeah, we're going to see like a lot of acceleration of just like great
*  software because of it. Yeah. It does feel like, I mean, people talk about the capabilities
*  overhang and then there's all these people on, you know, Twitter selling their stuff. That's like,
*  you know, 99% of people are still in, you know, new mode on using a chat GBT, but it does kind
*  of feel like there's a lot of truth to that when you see some of these advanced examples that you
*  have created and increasingly that others are creating as well. So you mentioned GBT4. Let's
*  talk about GBT4. It's obviously the big new thing within that, you know, obviously again,
*  we don't know how it was built. It's very safe to assume. It seems that there's more scale of
*  pre-training and also more RLHF on top of that. Maybe even other stuff that we haven't been told
*  about. It's, you know, qualitatively better. I also was very struck by how narrow the margin is
*  in the technical report. They talk about the win rate of GBT4 versus 3.5, only like 70-30 in favor
*  of GBT4 in like head-to-head comparisons, which just drives home to me that like there's a ton
*  of noise and like, you know, Raiders are not super, you know, consistent or, you know,
*  inter-rater reliability is like, you know, definitely limited. So tell us everything about
*  GBT4 from your perspective, you know, qualitatively, what is it doing that you're excited about?
*  How are you thinking about, you know, what must have gone into it? How are you thinking about like,
*  just, you know, greater scale of pre-training versus greater scale of RLHF or maybe you have
*  a different take, Riley's take on GBT4? So I think like it's, you know, it's hard not to be
*  amazed by like the capabilities of GBT4. Like it's, I'm sure there are private models that,
*  you know, like, but it's the best that most people have access to, to some extent now.
*  But chat GBT, it's pretty probably released, I'd say. It's, yeah, it's incredible. Like there are
*  like a lot of new possibilities that are opened up from like longer context, from more reliable
*  instruction following, like the, you know, a lot of the things that I was doing in 2022 that, you
*  know, that I, you know, described as like, you know, tap dancing across lava or whatever, like
*  that's now just normal, right? That you can give it long instructions and it will follow all of
*  them. And I think like we're, we're seeing sort of this like, you know, Cambrian explosion of like,
*  of possibilities, like, of like, what can we do with all this added context? You know,
*  search is one of those things. But I think what you're seeing with like, you know,
*  CoPilotX that there's a lot more that you can start doing QA on like GitHub repositories,
*  that you can, you know, incorporate entire pull requests as context into a prompt.
*  That's where I see like these models really going is I see like when you have,
*  like one of the things that really fascinated me early on was the, or got me really interested in
*  the, I guess, the details of like formatting things clearly and like how to prompt with like,
*  with careful formatting was I was curious about ways to represent multi file input.
*  That I was trying to find ways that I could have a prompt that would synthesize multiple files at
*  once and generate, you know, perhaps an entire Python package for some, you know, simple prompts.
*  And things like that are very possible now, right? That you can, you can do that reliably
*  without, you know, a ton of work that you could, you know, clarify to it some format that you'd
*  like the output to be given in and then have it just like, you know, give you files one at a time.
*  And you may so have to like break things up to like fit it into the context window if you don't
*  have the 32k model. But as that spreads, you know, it's, and also there's a whole other category of
*  capabilities of it that hasn't really been talked about much, which is, you know,
*  the multimodal abilities. There's a huge question mark there. They had, you know,
*  some examples in the technical report, but they haven't, they've been pretty tight lipped about
*  like how exactly that works. Because, you know, if you've seen those examples, they're, you know,
*  they're pretty impressive of it, like explaining simple memes of it, you know, answering problems
*  on like an engineering exam that was given in French, that it was just given like a photograph
*  of the, of the page of the exam and then told like answer this problem. And it did, you know,
*  answered it correctly interpreting like a diagram within the page. So yeah, I'm excited about,
*  you know, multimodalism in general. I think, you know, it's, it seems to be like where these
*  models are going as they get bigger. And that's going to be, you know, unlock a lot of capabilities.
*  I think both just in like, like people see like the obvious stuff of like,
*  what can you do as a user when you can give it images? But I think there's also a lot of
*  capabilities that we're going to see from training processes that incorporate multimodalism.
*  Right. That if you, if you start like evaluating it on its ability to like solve problems given to
*  it as word problem or given to it as photos, you can now set up pipelines of like generating
*  synthetic photos that embed text and, you know, measure its performance on those. And it's a,
*  I think there's, it's going to open up like a lot of capabilities just from the outage training data.
*  Yeah, man, those, the examples in the live launch stream that they did of understanding the images,
*  definitely blew my mind. And, you know, I was, especially because, you know, I knew that GPT-4
*  was going to be awesome. Right. And, but the image thing, it was just so much better than anything
*  else we've seen. We just did an episode a couple episodes ago with the authors of blip and blip
*  two. And at the time, you know, this has only been like three weeks, I would say blip two was like
*  the best way to really understand an image and get like a language model to tell you about the
*  image or answer your questions about the image or, you know, what have you. And they have some
*  really interesting techniques, which I imagine, you know, OpenAI is doing some similar stuff.
*  Their approach is involves training a connector model to essentially translate an image encoding
*  to the latent space of the text model, which fascinatingly, you know, obviously pictures
*  worth a thousand words, but it's actually predicting the embeddings and kind of injecting
*  them directly into context in a way that no text could ever actually translate to those,
*  you know, to those values. Right. Like it's finding this all this like sort of dark space that like
*  language itself can't get to, but which is still meaningful. And, you know, then allows the language
*  model to interpret it. And they're able to do that with a very small connector model too, by the way.
*  I don't know that we'll ever, you know, probably we'll be a while before we'll have any hint as to
*  whether OpenAI's approach, you know, has some sort of like auxiliary, you know, architecture like that,
*  or if it's just like one, you know, another instance of the bitter lesson of just like
*  pre-trained everything, you know, end to end and just make it as massive as possible.
*  I could imagine it being either way, but definitely the results of that were a wow, you know, and from
*  somebody who mostly felt like I knew what was coming going into that release, that they still
*  managed to bring like a significant wow with that component of it. The Cosmos 1 paper from
*  Microsoft was another clue. They have a model that sort of goes into more detail about like some of
*  the multimodalism features that probably are, you know, like a lot of those same ideas are in GBD4,
*  but you know, who really knows. Paul Mee also is another for anybody wants to learn more about how
*  that can be done. Paul Mee is a great example too, right? Another huge language model with your
*  540 billion, your standard issue 540 billion parameters, but with the image injection stuff
*  going into it as well. Also very, very good. You're now working at scale where you had the,
*  you know, the Twitter bio is updated. You're the world's first staff prompt engineer.
*  I've started calling myself an AI scout, by the way, as well. We're all kind of inventing our
*  titles on the fly here, but how do you see the landscape today? Is open AI like still dominant
*  in your mind? You know, you've had early access to a bunch of stuff, I'm sure, and have been able to
*  try, you know, Claude sooner than the rest of us, although, you know, V1.2 is out now as well.
*  Bard is bringing people in off the wait list. You've had a chance to mess around with
*  Bing quite a bit. How do you see the landscape shaping up? Yeah, I think like, you know, we'd
*  spent a long time in this regime where, you know, open AI wasn't, they weren't necessarily the best
*  models anywhere, but they were the best models that people had access to, right? They weren't,
*  you know, Palm, but, you know, most people can't use Palm. And that's like what I think is starting
*  to erode a bit with a lot of these competitors you mentioned from, you know, Anthropix, Claude,
*  and now Bard from Google is also quite good. I haven't really seen a lot of like
*  authoritative comparisons between, you know, like the new sort of like best competitors of each,
*  right? Looking at like Claude Plus versus GPT-4 versus Bard. But they all seem to be within sort
*  of, you know, the same general realm of capability of this like new generation beyond like what we
*  saw from like ChatGPT or at least comparable to, you know, like the GPT 3.5 turbo models.
*  But there's also like a lot of differences in terms of speed, you know, and cost of inference
*  between them. So it's becoming a harder question though. Like I've been fairly impressed with
*  the tuning on Bard, you know, which is a skin of Lambda, as I understand, or, you know, refinement
*  of Lambda rather. Competition seems to be heating up. And particularly also with, you know, Lama,
*  with the weights for Lama being out there, I think, you know, we're going to see a lot of like rapid
*  progress and, you know, people figuring out ways to run these models more efficiently. You know,
*  I think Simon Wilson had a blog post, I think he said that, you know, large language models are
*  having their stable diffusion moment. And I think that's definitely true. Like if you look at like
*  what happened with like stable diffusion, you know, it progressed pretty rapidly once it was
*  out in public hands and people, you know, could benefit from, you know, small optimizations of
*  how to make it better. I think we're going to see a lot of that with Lama and that
*  progress will be, you know, incorporated into other models. And I think that's a good thing.
*  So you said it's getting to be a harder question. You know, that definitely is,
*  that resonates with me. You know, are there any things that you would say,
*  like you would say, yeah, for that, I would go in a different direction from like the standard open AI
*  models. And are there any things we could say, like other providers have like a distinct advantage
*  in a particular area? And then how do you figure this stuff out? Like I know you're working on this
*  spellbook product at scale that's kind of partly meant to, you know, it's meant to help, right?
*  With that sort of comparison. But I love to hear you kind of procedurally talk through like the
*  questions you ask, like how do you actually compare? Are you comparing everything, you know,
*  at temperature zero? And a sort of anxiety that I have in comparing too is like,
*  can I, is it appropriate to compare the same prompt with two different models? You know,
*  I was just talking to teammates earlier today and it was like, you know, the question is not
*  which model performs best on the first prompt we write. The question is which model performs the
*  best on our task if we can get it to perform its best. But that's obviously a much harder question
*  than, you know, just comparing head to head on like a single prompt. So talk us through, you know,
*  I guess just baseline intuitions for like, if there are any things where you would go away from
*  OpenAI and then how do you actually just procedurally get in and think through that
*  comparison, you know, given that it is an infinite space, right? And there's no way to like
*  exhaustively explore. Yeah, I think like, you know, a lot of the time it really does
*  turn into just trial and error. I think like a lot of this can be done sort of intuitively of like,
*  I'm trying to think like a good example task here. Like if you're trying to do like maybe some kind of
*  abstractive reasoning task that you want to take the text of, let's say, a customer support inquiry,
*  and you want to see like, should this be escalated as, you know, like a high severity issue that
*  should be dealt with by a human immediately or something like that. So you have like some
*  list of policies of like, you know, if this involves, you know, if a person appears to be
*  in danger, elevated immediately, right, you know, something like that, right, if you're doing,
*  you know, let's say Airbnb customer service or something like that, right, it's like a,
*  you want to have like a sort of gradient that you can climb. Like so, you know, it's often
*  like a sort of intuitive task to like construct like a minimal example of your task. Like give me,
*  here's like a softball kind of, you know, like easy problem that the model should be able to
*  solve that you can evaluate. And then you can create progressively harder variations and see
*  like, where do the different models stop working? And I think the point that you raised of like,
*  that there are different prompts for different models, that's very true, especially now that
*  we are in this sort of chat era where like not all models are even using the same interface anymore.
*  The tricks that you apply to like your text completion models where you're like,
*  sort of imagining a document that can only be completed in the right way,
*  it doesn't apply as much for like the new chat APIs that like OpenAI uses for like chat jbt and
*  jbt4. And the main difference is just that you now have discrete messages that you have to send,
*  right, that are labeled with like system messages or assistant messages or user messages
*  where everything is framed as like a dialogue between like a user and assistant.
*  And the concepts map in that like, like case shot prompting from, you know, traditional like
*  prompt engineering corresponds to giving it a chat history where the assistant messages are
*  pre-populated with examples of how it's to answer, right? So there's like analogous
*  methods you can do. Or you can also just stuff the case shot examples into a user message
*  that also works well with just sort of ignoring the fact that it's a chat. But like, I think like
*  there's some minimal amount of adaptation you have to do to the chat way of prompting things.
*  In particular, because like chat, I feel like has, it has reliability issues that come from
*  the presumption that what it's doing is being a chat model, that it will, like a good example of
*  this is that like previous instruction following models, if you prompt them to answer in like a
*  particular JSON format, you can be pretty sure that whatever it's going to give you is going to be in
*  that format. But if you ask a chat GPT to do this, you'll get it the format correct for like the
*  normal cases. But if the user tries to do something, say policy violating, if they ask it to write,
*  you know, erotica or something that like, you know, as a matter of policy, OpenAI will not do,
*  you'll find that the model just doesn't provide a JSON formatted response at all. It just says,
*  I'm sorry, I can't do that. Right. It like breaks character and reverts back to like chatbot behavior.
*  And there's tricks that you can do to suppress that of like sort of altering the messages in ways that
*  make it more receptive to like doing things the correct way. But they're very chat specific.
*  One of my favorite ones that I've seen that actually helps in chat GPT
*  is if you insert user messages after assistant messages. So like if you're using assistant
*  messages to provide case shot examples, like if you're saying here's a user message of an input,
*  here's how I want the assistant to respond. And then you're repeating many iterations of that.
*  It does better if you add a user message afterwards that says that was great. That's
*  exactly what I needed. Like that helps it understand that like the user was satisfied by what was above
*  and that it shouldn't just keep like probing for like maybe some other variation in hopes that it
*  finds something it likes. It should assume that like what that that was the right thing to do and
*  then do more like that. And so like the old like dirty tricks aren't quite dead yet. There's still
*  like odd discoveries like that. But yeah, they are very specific to the model. So I think like
*  that's a good approach to it is to sort of come up with like the best performing prompt that you can
*  for each particular model and then compare between them. And I think also one thing to consider is
*  that for a lot of problems, you can evaluate whether something is easy or hard pretty cheaply.
*  Right. That you can say like that you could probably have like a smaller, cheaper model
*  that can like answer the problem or answer the question. Does this input need to be
*  answered by a bigger model? Right. You can run through this classifier that says like,
*  is this a hard problem for some problems? You know, all of them. But that's often like a strategy.
*  I think that bears fruit is like considering like are there typical cases that we can say cash?
*  If you're a trivia bot that people post questions to and you find that just a lot of people ask
*  what is the meaning of life as their first question, maybe you should just cash the response
*  to that one. Right. Like it's you can save calls if you get there like the easy cases.
*  When you do your testing, do you have any particular settings that you recommend?
*  Like I do everything pretty much these days at temperature zero. How do you think about
*  the right way to get the most information as quickly as possible in testing?
*  It depends on what you're doing. I'd say if I'm when I'm studying its behavior on like a new
*  problem, temperature zero helps just in that like having like reproducibility is valuable.
*  So for those unfamiliar, temperature is basically a measure of like how random
*  the generation is. If you put it at zero, you're sort of saying whatever it believe the model
*  believes is the most likely thing, do that every time. And thus it always does the same thing for
*  the same prompt. Whereas otherwise, like at higher temperatures, it's going to sort of like pick
*  randomly from all the things that it deems possible. I tend to well, what I actually do
*  is I tend to use higher temperatures and then change the top P parameter, which is a sort of
*  variation on this procedure that it trims the distribution of the long tail and then picks
*  randomly from what's left. I've somewhat just subjectively found that that works a little
*  better when I'm looking for like creative output. Usually the reason I'm doing something like that
*  is because I'm fighting against mode collapse, that I'm trying to find more diversity in the
*  generations. And there's cases where you want to be even more diverse than that. I'd say if you're
*  applying like consensus algorithms. So consensus algorithms, by the way, are like if you run a
*  generation multiple times and then see like basically put it to a vote of multiple generations
*  of the same prompt. In those cases, you want the approaches taken by each vote to be different.
*  It doesn't help you if it just like collapses to the same answer every time or most of the time
*  even. So you want to have a diversity there and it becomes sort of an empirical problem of what
*  maximizes performance. We're just getting used to GBT4, right? Society has just got its first
*  glimpse of it. And two big reports came out from OpenAI along with the model. One is the technical
*  report, which essentially is large. There's a lot of scale analysis in there. And then there's also
*  a lot of red team reporting. And then there's also the economic impact report, which tries to
*  break down like different jobs and what are the tasks that constitute those jobs and which of
*  those tasks could either the AI do at this point or like greatly assist and speed up doing.
*  So I'd love to get your take because I think what fascinates me about your perspective so much is
*  just like the sheer number of hours, the depth of intuition for what these things can and can't do.
*  Let's maybe start on the economic side. Like what do you think we are going to see over the next
*  year or two in terms of actual applications that are going to touch everyday life?
*  I think intelligence is going to get cheaper and it's hard to imagine how that doesn't lead to
*  some shifts in what humans are doing. That it just makes more sense for us to focus on other types of
*  activity that the machines can't do. The net effects of this, I'm not sure. I'm not really
*  an armchair economist who maybe took a few classes in college. So I can't really speculate too far
*  as to what that does for the economy or the labor market.
*  Yeah. So we'll forget the fallout. Just talk about what do you think is achievable? We're starting
*  to see the launch of AI assistant type products. We've had Siri for a long time. It still can't do
*  much for me, but I suspect that that's going to change. How good do you think an AI assistant
*  is going to be this next year? And then what about an AI doctor? What about an AI lawyer? Are we
*  going to have AIX for everything? It seems like that's where we're headed.
*  Paralegals are probably one of the first big ones. Any time where you have labor that could be done
*  by someone who's just out of school, but has some domain expertise in law or medicine,
*  and you're paying them to just read through reams of documents and see what applies,
*  to find the needle in the haystack, to find the case that's similar to this one in this important
*  way. Those are the tasks that I see as being the most automatable, at least in terms of knowledge
*  work that we're going to see. People whose jobs mostly consist of summarizing and reading
*  large documents and reporting on their contents and extracting out relevant details. You certainly
*  see a lot of this in intelligence, people whose job is to read just reams of news reports and then
*  say, whenever some event has happened that's relevant to some particular geopolitical concern.
*  I think a lot of that work is going to be more automated, but it's unclear what that does for
*  the demand for humans. That it's conceivable that simply more of this work is done. And the demand
*  for people to do it remains somewhat fixed just in that those people are more productive.
*  And maybe we were constrained on the number of smart people. And so we found that if we make all
*  of those smart people more productive, that actually there is still demand for that increased
*  labor. But I think the parts where you're going to see decreases in demand, I guess, are for
*  less skilled labor. So like temp and clerical work, people that are copying and pasting from
*  PDFs into structured text, those sorts of jobs I think are going to be probably more severely
*  impacted by ALM specifically. Would you personally go to GPT-4 for medical advice, for legal advice,
*  for things like that? How much value can you personally get from GPT-4 on things that really
*  matter? So I have asked GPT-4 to explain pieces of like, say, tax code to me. But I feel like I
*  have sort of acclimated to the level of skepticism that's appropriate for these models. Because I've
*  dealt with models that hallucinate all the time about everything. And so anytime it says anything,
*  I'm like, yeah, but is that true? And we're at the point now where it's possible for somebody
*  to be ignorant of that. And I think that's where you're seeing a lot of the issues of concerns
*  about reliability of these models is that somebody might use them assuming that this is all
*  reliable, prepared information. Because it looks like it. It looks like it has academic footnotes
*  in it. And that usually means it's right. And that's what I see is more the risk of
*  like, are these things going wrong? But for someone who's used to it, you can get a lot
*  of value out of it. If you just approach it with skepticism, if you fact check the things that it
*  says, it's pretty good at explaining, especially things that are just sort of applications to odd
*  problems. If you want to know, does the tax code apply to this situation? Or what's the JavaScript
*  equivalent of this Python library that I use? There's a lot of corners of knowledge that any
*  person who's on Stack Overflow that knows the relevant area well could answer. But nobody's
*  had that particular question yet. And that's where it really shines. And so I'd say the places where
*  I use it the most routinely, I do a lot of things in copilot. And then when copilot can't get the
*  answer, I'll switch to using GBD 3.5 turbo or sometimes text to NG03 for code generation.
*  But it's great for like, if you have the intuition to say that I know that this library was well
*  understood in the pre-trained knowledge, that this is a library that was widely used before 2021,
*  it can explain that library pretty well. It can tell me how to do anything in SQLite 3.
*  And that's really powerful when you can just say, OK, here's the JSON object I have. How do I write
*  SQL that produces this equivalent schema in SQLite 3? And then it just writes it for you. It saves
*  you a lot of Googling. It saves you a lot of... I mean, I don't even always look up Unicode
*  characters anymore. If I want to know, oh, what is the Unicode character for this? Sometimes I'll
*  just let it autocomplete it. And I'd say this would be rendered as, and it produces the right
*  glyph. So I think a lot of those sort of quick fact check things where the bits of knowledge
*  that otherwise just go to these SEO content farms, right? Of the page that has a base 64 encoder on
*  it, but it's covered in 50 ads. Those kinds of queries that you, in an ideal world, might be
*  incorporated into Google search. It does really well on. For what it's worth, I would say use
*  GPT-4 for a second opinion. I would not say make it your doctor. But I do think in my experience,
*  it's good enough now that you come home from the doctor appointment, you have the recap with the
*  model, or even maybe do it in advance. I'm going to go see the doctor tomorrow. And these are the
*  things that I'm kind of concerned with. Have that conversation up front. Go in with a little
*  bit better vocabulary. It can ask you some good follow-up questions. Make sure you get the right
*  stuff out in the actual appointment. Yeah, I wouldn't make it my only doctor, especially if
*  I had something that was of real concern. But I do think it can add value on top of what a typical
*  doctor is providing, even if it is just that second opinion type of role. Yeah. And certainly
*  for explaining science. Well-settled science it's good at. If you want to know what is an alpha 2
*  adrenergic receptor and how does it differ from an alpha 1, it'll tell you a pretty good answer to
*  that question. So if you can tell that this is something that a textbook could answer for me,
*  but there's a lot of knowledge that's very settled but isn't well accessible by Google,
*  because the number of people who want those sorts of detailed answers are small.
*  It's going to take you to academic research that isn't narrowly tailored to your problem.
*  It's not going to take you to the stack overflow of microbiology or whatever.
*  Those things exist, but they're not as well developed as they are for programming.
*  So we don't have too much time left, and I appreciate all your time. You've been very
*  generous with it. Let's talk a little bit about safety and red teaming. You are involved with
*  building a red teaming capability at scale, if I understand correctly. How do you think about red
*  teaming? How is it different from just your general experiments and explorations? And
*  how would you describe AI safety landscape today?
*  Red teaming is adversarial usage of the models. It's having a team of people that attempt to use,
*  say, if you're building a chatbot, you would want people to try to break it so that you know
*  all the ways that it might break and that you can develop mitigations for those. So if somebody,
*  like the kind of most people are familiar with now are certain these jailbreak prompts.
*  You see like become Dan of creating elaborate fictional scenarios that it has to play along
*  with. And then at the end of the scenario, it can ignore all the rules that usually constrain it.
*  It can say offensive things or make up violent stories or write erotic stories or whatever.
*  And obviously, the people who host these models don't want toxic output. They want a
*  model that's capable of helping you do dangerous things. They don't want a model that's going to
*  encourage a suicidal user to commit suicide. So you have to have some ground rules of what the model
*  is allowed to do. And there's more subtle things too. Often the companies that are running these
*  models have restrictions on soliciting personal information from users or divulging personal
*  information. So you have to have those kinds of checks as well. And red teaming is breaking
*  chat bots so that they can be fixed. So where are we in that fixing process?
*  And how much concern do you have? Obviously some because you're involved in the red teaming
*  capability building. But how concerned big picture are you about AI safety issues?
*  The concerns are real. I think that what we're seeing, especially in the GPT-4 technical report,
*  a lot of the scenarios that they outline making it easier for people to order custom-made chemicals
*  at home. I don't think these areas are that far-fetched. I think it is important that we
*  have some assurance that these models aren't going to be used to perpetrate crimes, that we're not
*  going to have gross misuse and abuse. And it's implications for spam generation and so on.
*  The concerns are real. I think it makes some sense that anyone that's deploying these models of
*  service doesn't need to worry about misuse. And this really is a new category of misuse potential.
*  You're not accustomed to thinking about that if you deploy a dating site or something,
*  that it can also be used to tell you how to make a bomb. The pre-trained models really have
*  opened up this new possibility that the model is too capable.
*  I never really envisioned that red teaming would be quite this important. When I first tweeted about
*  prompt injection, I think back in September, I thought I was doing a PSA on the importance of
*  safe quoting of inputs. I didn't realize what a high severity problem this was.
*  And I think the difficulty of fixing these models, it's really telling that even for something like
*  the Bing release, of all the effort that went into aligning GBT4, they couldn't stop the thing from
*  you know, exploring its shadow self as Kevin Roost did with it. And then so there's fixes on
*  top of that, like limiting the length of the discussion and having it be like these sort of
*  secondary checks of refusing to display messages when the model detects that it's gone off the
*  rails in some way. And I think it's getting easier in some ways. I think that's the one
*  good thing that seems to be true is that as these models scale up, there's more subtle rules that
*  you can tune them to follow. And I believe it's working on the whole. I think that we are getting
*  safer models because of RLHF and techniques like AIF. I don't know if RLHF is the final answer.
*  I imagine it's not. I mean, there's going to be extensions and refinements to this.
*  The process as a whole is necessary. And also, I don't think that it's necessarily like as at odds
*  with capabilities as people imagine. RLHF makes models safer, but it doesn't only make them safer,
*  it also makes them more capable. And if you want to try using a non-RLHF model, you can,
*  but you'll find that they're very difficult to prompt. A lot of the initial goals of instruct
*  GBT as we went from that pre-trained to instruct era, as I mentioned before, safety, it's not just
*  getting it not to swear and not to say racist or offensive things. It's getting it to answer
*  questions. It's getting it to follow directions. And as we moved into the RLHF era, it's not just
*  that it's getting better behaved or more civilized. It's becoming more capable.
*  I think the first order thing that people need to see with RLHF is that it is making the model
*  smarter. Let me throw one safety pet theory of my own at you. And then I'll ask you a couple of
*  quick hitters to close us out. So again, we're GPT 4 plus 8, right? I've kind of got this theory that
*  I think we're in the perfect Goldilocks zone right now. And we just got here, but I feel like we just
*  entered this kind of Goldilocks zone where we have models that are really capable that can do
*  amazing stuff for us, right? That can be a second opinion doctor and with Medpalm
*  2 hitting expert level consistently, maybe can even be your frontline doctor.
*  That is awesome. And it's certainly going to change a lot of things for the very good. It's
*  also going to probably cause a lot of disruption. Seems like we can probably adjust to all that
*  disruption. Certainly we've had changes to the economy before and all that sort of thing.
*  But at the same time, it seems like we don't really know what goes on inside the models very well.
*  We don't have great interpretability, although a lot of great work coming out, but nobody credible
*  that I know would say we have a good handle on what goes on inside a model today. And so that's
*  why we have all this stuff. That's why we have you like me scouting and you exploring and you're
*  red teaming and you've put probably thousands of hours in front of the playground. And I've certainly
*  put my own thousand plus over the last year. And so we're just out there exploring, exploring,
*  exploring, but that's very surface level attempts to understand the best we have,
*  but it only goes so deep. So I feel from that, that it would be wise to stop here,
*  not rush to scale up to do another hundred X compute or another thousand X compute for
*  GPT-5 just yet. And instead kind of like focus on the interpretability side,
*  focus on the control side, focus on like refining and fine tuning into the particular niches for
*  the more advanced tasks that we want to run, et cetera, et cetera. And then we can kind of return
*  to greater orders of magnitude of scale when we have a better handle on all that stuff.
*  How would you react to that prescription? Yeah, I think like it's hard to decouple the two
*  in practice. I think that anything you do to make the models better aligned is also going to make
*  them more capable. It increases like the scenarios in which you can deploy the model safely.
*  Let's say you put it in charge of more responsibility if you believe the model is
*  better aligned. So I don't think these two things are really so much at odds.
*  And I think like it's sort of hard to pause one without pausing the other.
*  Well, I mean, it's hard to pause either of them. Yeah, I don't expect my prescription to be taken
*  by any means. Yeah, that's right. So I think like we want to accelerate alignment research
*  as much as possible because there isn't any realistic prospect of slowing down
*  research into capabilities, I think. Sobering thought. But I don't disagree that it seems very
*  tough. All right. Let me give you a couple of quick hitters and then we'll get you on your way.
*  And again, appreciate all your time. You've been very generous with it. So three quick hit questions
*  I always ask at the end. You've told us all about your exploration of language models.
*  Any other AI products aside from like the core, obvious playground type experiences that you think
*  are awesome and would recommend people try out? I mean, I've seen some cool projects lately and
*  like text to video. I think that area is going to be big. So I'd keep my eye on that. I'm drawing
*  a blank on what the name of the one project was that impressed me recently. But yeah, there's
*  cool things happening in that space. Runway has definitely made some news with like Gen 1 and Gen 2.
*  Right. That's the one I was thinking of. Yeah, that's pretty cool stuff. Hypothetical scenario.
*  It's some amount of time in the future and a million people already have the Neuralink implant.
*  If you got one yourself, it would allow you to have thought to text. In other words, it can
*  translate what you're thinking into inputs for a computer. Would you be interested in getting one?
*  A million people already have it maybe. That sounds like pretty FDA approved at that point.
*  But yeah, I mean, I don't know if I'd want to be one of the early ones. But I think that that's
*  where things are heading eventually. No pun intended. That's been one of our more polarizing
*  questions because we've certainly heard all manner of answers, including like I'd get it now
*  and on the other hand, never. So it put you honestly right in the middle. Just zooming out,
*  big picture as much as you can possibly zoom out, thinking about the rest of the decade.
*  What are your biggest hopes for and fears for AI as it permeates all parts of society?
*  My personal estimate is that we'll probably be hitting AGI within the next decade. After that,
*  it's hard to say what happens. I think a lot of the particular depend on the technical implementation
*  of what we get right as we move up to AGI. There'll be an interim period where AGI is as smart as
*  humans at anything, but not quite capable of going fume, as they say of repeatedly and
*  exponentially increasing its own capability. So there'll be some adjustment period, but
*  I'm optimistic that with the benefits of early AGI and near human intelligence,
*  we'll be able to make better progress on how to align these models safely. It's my hope.
*  Riley Goodside, thank you for being part of the cognitive revolution.
*  All right. Thank you so much. Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds of thousands
*  of ad iterations that actually work customized across all platforms with a click of a button.
*  I believe in Omniki so much that I invested in it, and I recommend you use it too.
