# Stability AI’s Emad Mostaque and Slow Ventures’ Sam Lessin Debate Investing in AI
**Cognitive Revolution "How AI Changes Everything":** [June 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOOYJONenWU)
*  I think a key question of this is like, you know, people say hallucinations.
*  I was like, what does that mean? Well, I mean, it doesn't get every single fact completely right.
*  Chant GPT is probably like 100 gigabytes down from like 10 trillion words. The fact you can get
*  anything right is an absolute technical marvel that no one's really sure exactly how that happens.
*  What if you had an AI tutor for every child? What does that look like? What if you had 100 AI
*  tutors for every child? For the first time, every single person can have hundreds of characters that
*  like and support them all the time. Basically, you log into social media or whatever, and you're
*  like, Hey, I'm Sam. It's like, cool. What type of people is that? Who do you want to follow? It's
*  like, who do you want to follow you? For example, there aren't enough therapists in the world,
*  you know, and it is regulated industry. But at the same time, there is a gap for therapists,
*  just like you have the meditation apps kind of step in. And they created calm, they create
*  these other things that were huge. Hello, and welcome to the cognitive revolution, where we
*  interview visionary researchers, entrepreneurs and builders working on the frontier of artificial
*  intelligence. Each week, we'll explore their revolutionary ideas. And together, we'll build
*  a picture of how AI technology will transform work, life and society in the coming years.
*  I'm Nathan Labenz joined by my co host, Eric Torenberg. Hello, and welcome back to the cognitive
*  revolution. Today's episode is a super interesting one on a number of levels,
*  as we're hosting a discussion between two super influential technology thinkers. Sam Lesson,
*  former VP of product at Facebook, now early stage technology investor and writer,
*  and Imad Mostak, founder and CEO of Stability AI, whose work at stability, highlighted, of course,
*  by stable diffusion, has already been incredibly influential, but has also come under intense
*  scrutiny in the months since he raised $100 million at a $1 billion valuation. This conversation
*  started on Twitter with a short essay that Sam wrote, arguing that AI is mostly a bad investment
*  for VC. Imad responded and suggested a podcast on the topic. And Eric and I were naturally happy
*  to volunteer to host. Both Sam and Imad talk fast. This is a 1.5x speed episode for me, down from
*  the usual 2x. And both had a lot to say. So we mostly let them speak directly to each other
*  before I jumped in at the end to ask some concrete questions. I think regular listeners
*  to the show will know that I definitely share Sam's point of view around investing in AI.
*  AI may well disrupt society at large, but it doesn't seem likely to disrupt many existing
*  SaaS markets between now and then. There will, as Sam says, always be exception. But for someone
*  whose focus is on looking for those early stage companies with 100x potential investment returns,
*  I think he's quite right that there'll be few and far between, at least at the model and application
*  layers. For what it's worth, though, I do think Sam is quite wrong to limit his thinking about
*  LLM function to the no real intelligence, just association between words paradigm.
*  There is now ample mechanistic interpretability work that shows quite conclusively that AI models
*  are indeed grokking much more than statistical correlation. But that's a topic for another
*  episode. For today, the subtext of the conversation seemed to be this question. Will Stability AI
*  prove to be one of those exceptional, highly successful startups, deserving of its unicorn
*  status and valuation? From my standpoint, the answer may depend on your definition of success.
*  Stability is as much a movement as a company and has already left an indelible mark on AI
*  open source culture. Their impact goes beyond the groundbreaking stable diffusion, including major
*  data set releases such as the Lyon 5 billion image data set, various language models and accompanying
*  open source RLHF libraries which enable further downstream training and customization, and many,
*  many other projects across a wide range of modalities. They've also established themselves
*  as tremendous identifiers of and supporters of talent, including another upcoming guest,
*  19 year old PhD, Tanishq Matthew Abraham, who just published a literal mind reading paper
*  that converts fMRI data into reconstructed images of what the person saw. Truly mind blowing work.
*  But perhaps more important than any of that has been a mod's unique ability to articulate an
*  inspiring vision for the future of AI. While the positive vision of AI that we tend to hear when
*  we hear one at all often centers around the possibility of large and powerful AGI's, of which
*  there might only be a few, presumably built and owned by leading technology firms. A mod has not
*  only signed the AGI pause letter and the extinction risk statement, but has articulated a very
*  different positive vision for a panoply of smaller AI models, mostly presumably derived from the open
*  source standards that he and the team at Stability are creating, but all highly specialized for
*  specific purposes and localized to specific contexts and culture. This is an extremely
*  appealing notion to billions of people around the world who don't want to be beholden to American
*  or for that matter Chinese corporations for their access to AI. A mod has been criticized recently
*  for allegedly exaggerating certain claims and affiliations and for some operational problems at
*  Stability that resulted in people sometimes being paid late. And while some of that may well have
*  happened, I will say that I've followed a mod quite closely now for at least a year and have
*  generally found him to be very reasonable. He has, for example, always recognized the reality of
*  open AI and Google's modes and has projected that open source models will continue to lag leading
*  to lag leading closed source models by a year or more. All of this seems quite right and reasonable
*  to me. Given a mod's comments about the centrality of stories, I think it's safe to say he understands
*  the task of developing a positive vision for AI, a vision that others can really buy into as a core
*  part of his role and strategy. This is quite different from other AI CEOs who often seem to be
*  sharing their plans more for your information than for your input. And it really does seem to be
*  working. I've joined the discords of many Stability affiliated projects and have been very impressed
*  with the quality of people and conversations that they contain. So whether Stability will ultimately
*  deliver a great return for the investors who bought in at that one billion dollar valuation
*  is for me not the most interesting question about the company. I'd be very surprised if they failed
*  outright given the quality of talent that they have. And so the question that matters more to me
*  is simply what impact will they have? Will their push toward decentralization prove democratizing,
*  destabilizing, or both? If you fear centralization of power and you want to see a rich ecology of
*  AIs develop around the world, you might expect their contribution to be extremely positive.
*  If on the other hand you fear chaos and see AIs as invasive species colonizing niche after
*  niche and ultimately perhaps competing with humans, you might feel quite the opposite indeed.
*  For my part, as you can probably guess, I expect the outcome will ultimately be a bit of both.
*  Throughout this conversation you'll hear just how much change both Sam and Imad take for granted
*  as they think about the future. Culture, entertainment, and relationships, they agree,
*  are in for a shock. The Global South may well have leapfrog moments in education and even medicine.
*  Online communities may come to contain AI characters that we can't even identify as non-human.
*  Given the magnitude of all these changes and the resources and talent that Imad has amassed,
*  the inspiration he's provided, and the tremendous global need that AI seems so well suited to fill,
*  I think stability has a real chance not only to become a great company, but to help shape a global,
*  universal basic intelligence standard, a potentially historic development.
*  How humans ultimately wield the new power that Imad and others unlock,
*  and whether we can control AI long term at all, is much harder to predict,
*  but can ultimately only go one way or the other.
*  Now, I hope you enjoy this fast-paced conversation with Imad Mostak and Sam Lesson.
*  I think that large language models and a lot of the AI stuff that we're seeing kind of start to
*  get consumerized right now and become real, it's super cool. There's no question about that.
*  There are absolutely going to be great product experiences improved by it,
*  and opportunities to create more efficiency, create better interfaces. I am not negative
*  on how some of this stuff will find its way into consumer product experiences and make things
*  better. My wife's company, the publication of the information, we've already deployed a bunch of AI
*  stuff that makes search for the information go from absolutely terrible to pretty good.
*  There's a bunch more stuff coming that will get better. I'm not against that. I do think
*  the things that I keep in mind, one as an investor, is I think the case about why a bunch of this
*  technology is going to make Meta and Amazon and Google and a bunch of big players, a assload of
*  money are clear. I think the idea that it is a wedge or an angle that's going to allow a bunch
*  of companies from zero to come out of nowhere and then become wildly profitable or compete with those
*  guys, types of big players, I think is much more sus, as they would say. It's because to really
*  take advantage of this stuff, you need a ton of distribution, you need a ton of data. I really
*  see a lot of what I've seen is opportunities to extend innovation that already exists versus
*  completely reshuffle the deck. That's my big thing. I am very bullish on crypto long term.
*  Crypto is undeniable, whatever you think of it, a deck reshuffler. AI, and what we're seeing,
*  is not a deck reshuffler from my perspective, it's an extender. People come pitch me, we're going to
*  be the Adobe of AI. I'm like, Adobe is going to be the Adobe of AI from a deployment. I think
*  it's a very tough one to see. Will there be exceptions? Of course there will be exceptions.
*  There are always exceptions, but I think as a team thing, I think it's hard. I'd also say as an
*  investor, a seed investor, which is how I earn my daily bread, I'd say that the opportunities
*  to deploy a few million dollars, turn over a card and have an experience, like, oh my God,
*  there's something here. Now let's have a series A investor put a ton more money in and see it scale
*  up. I think there are few and far between. And because everyone's so excited, everything's way
*  mispriced. And so for me as an investor, I think it's an extremely hard market to get excited about.
*  What else can I say? I mean, look, I do think that the elephant in the room, which I'm sure we can
*  discuss or not, is for the companies that have gone out so far, we'll talk about chat GPT, I think
*  there's huge regulatory problems which are becoming clearer. And it's not about the machine
*  is going to eat us all. I think that's a load of crap, right? And I've been on the record for quite
*  some time being very, very negative and cynical about kind of a lot of those narratives. I mean,
*  at the end of the day, token guessing, guess the next token is not a fundamentally dangerous
*  piece of technology. I do think that the copyright issues are deeply real and complicated. And
*  there's a bunch of other challenges that these guys are going to face that, again, because the
*  world has a general viewpoint of like, fool me one shame on you, fool me twice shame on me,
*  is the era of from social media to Uber to whatever, I think people are going to be way
*  more quick reactive to what's going on from regulatory environment here, I hope, than
*  that historically. But I don't know, that's a ton of ground. And I don't know, where do you want to
*  go? Yeah, no, there's a ton of ground. I think there's this question of, is this a disruptive
*  or sustaining innovation? And there's a question of what this is. You have the classical big
*  data, and then you extrapolate it to sell you ads. And that was good old internet. And he created
*  these kind of behemoths in matter and Google in particular. But then you have the application
*  of computer vision and these other things largely to the incumbents. So value was captured there.
*  I was at your mobile and mobile is a great example of like, just double down, right?
*  Yeah. And that's why kind of Facebook's first shift mobile was good. Next shift to matter.
*  Maybe they'll rename themselves special or something. But, you know, this becomes very
*  interesting because like these models something a bit different. So like we'd stable diffusion
*  to the hundred thousand gigs of images and the Apple was a two gig file. And it was four of the
*  top 10 apps on the App Store in December. We're having that as the entire backend, you put words
*  in and images pop out and it makes pretty pictures of your face, right? But then they all dropped off
*  and they disappeared because there are more features than apps that are cool features.
*  But they weren't kind of product experiences. That is exactly what happened when the apps
*  were launched. Right. You had like fart apps as number one for $5.99. There's a brief moment
*  where it's cool and you're experimenting with it and you have these kind of poops, right? But they're
*  not. Yeah, they're like poops. Yeah, you're right. Exactly. Literally. It's not real because you have
*  to have the user experience and build products like normal. But where I feel right now is that
*  we're at the primitive stage and very boring interactions. One to one interaction is very
*  boring. I think it is again, very surface level without any memory and it's ephemeral and fleeting.
*  My thing is probably the iPhone 2G, iPhone 3G bit, we're just getting copy paste because what's
*  happened is you've got technology that's gone from research and is now starting to go into
*  engineering. What are the design patterns for this? How is it implemented? Was it good for?
*  I think a key question to this is like, you know, people say hallucinations.
*  I was like, what does that mean? Well, I mean, it doesn't get every single fact completely right.
*  Chat GPT is probably like 100 gigabytes down from like 10 trillion words. The fact you can get
*  anything right is an absolute technical marvel that no one's really sure exactly how that happens.
*  You know, it's like Pied Piper from Silicon Valley. That Wiseman stool would be even more
*  intense if you could press all that knowledge. Because what these really are, they're reasoning
*  machines, they're not fact machines because we've got two parts of our brain. Are they
*  reasoning machines? Aren't they guest the next token machines? I think that's a really fundamental
*  thing. I think my model and the easiest way for most consumers to think about this, I think
*  basically accurate, right? It's like, there's no actual intelligence to these systems, right? All
*  they're doing is saying, okay, based on all the words I've seen in the graph of language that
*  I've been able to observe, here's the most likely next token. And that's really cool to be clear.
*  That's like super useful. But calling that intelligence is a real stretch in my mind.
*  Well, I think it depends on your definition of intelligence. Like are you applying the
*  free energy principles of Carl Frieston and where everything's just intelligence from energy kind of
*  dropping to its last state or different definition of intelligence. I think what I look at it is like
*  this. One to one is getting the next token for language models, for image models, they're
*  diffusion based and that generate all sorts of other architectures. But it's about output and
*  what can it do? So one on one, it's a bit dumb, it doesn't have memory. You have the MetaPaper by
*  Cicero, whereby they had eight language models interacting with each other. And it outperformed
*  humans in the game of diplomacy. You know, you just like all that good old AlphaGo type stuff,
*  which used reinforcement learning. Is that intelligence? Probably still not, but it can
*  augment intelligence. That's something that we've been focusing on a lot because you can use it for
*  actual intelligence augmenting things. You can use it for reasoning things. Give it a PDF and say,
*  well, on earth, this is PDF talking about. You can do that right now. And that's a useful thing that
*  reduces frustration. I used to invest in video games. I used to look at time to fun flowing
*  frustration. I look at things like, you know, this podcast we're doing in a year, it'll be
*  automatically transcribed and edited and added to our knowledge base through next token prediction.
*  Does that require a GI? No. Yeah. Although interesting. Let's talk about this podcast.
*  I think it's a really interesting case. You know, in the early days of Clubhouse, when Clubhouse
*  was ripping, I used to like go after Paul all the time. And I wrote about this being like,
*  you're so stupid for not recording this stuff. Oh, I was like, look, here's the reality. These
*  conversations in class are drivel, right? Like 99% of them is crap and I don't want to listen to
*  it. However, if you've created a magical pump that says the internet is full of SEO shit and
*  Wikipedia, we have a magic pump of people wanting to talk to each other live. Here's the thing,
*  people want to talk, no one wants to listen. But if you transcribe and record it all and you can
*  create an index out of it, and then all of a sudden you have this meta, this next generation
*  search engine, but that's fucking interesting, right? Here's the problem. We're bossing at the
*  time, which I think turns out to be totally wrong, given where AI is coming. He's like,
*  yes, Sam, but like there's no way to index it and blah. I'm like, there will be, like,
*  there's clearly going to be, right? We're just, and it turns out I'd like to, you know,
*  because I like saying I told you so. Like I told you so. Like there are definitely a way to do that
*  now, right? And like that would have been super sweet. I think would have created. Here's the
*  problem though, is with a lot of these visions of like, oh, well, we'll just like take all the
*  recorded podcasts, right? And then kind of put a front end in time of them and like compress them
*  down and be done is there's no economic model to that. And maybe we can get into business models
*  for a second. That's going to make sense for anyone to publicly share anything, right? Like
*  the way, the reason that like people put things on the web was because they were getting paid for it
*  in one form or another, because the whole ecosystem of Google, right, created was a trade. It was,
*  okay, like you get to index this shit, but you're going to send me traffic and I can monetize it.
*  And like, you know, the publishers got snowed by that for a while, right? And like almost lost,
*  almost went away until they figured out paywalls, right? We're doing this now because it's kind of
*  fun and bullshit and we'll learn, right? But we're also kind of doing it. At least I'll do it. It's
*  like, eh, I'll post it. Maybe someone will follow me out of it. It's a fun hour to spend with
*  interesting people, right? But there's an economics to it in some form, social or financial capital.
*  This model, I actually think that the interesting thing about AI, if you take that view, what you
*  would think is interesting is like, it's already going to crush the information economy of the web,
*  right? I think that if you roll it forward, like this conversation will not be in the public domain,
*  right? Going forward, because there'll be no, there'll be no social economics to it. It'll
*  just be a compression on top of it. And if anything, AI, again, if you take the model of,
*  oh, it'll take a bunch of podcasts and compress them down into tweets, right? Will end up kind
*  of collapsing on itself if you need people, which you do, right? To ultimately be the source of
*  truth and information about the world. I'm super that point a bit, but I'm not sure I entirely agree.
*  Because you know, sometimes it's fun to shoot the shit. And Tony, you do have podcasts,
*  they've got their ads and things like that. But I think the attention economy is a very interesting
*  element to this, particularly because these models are based on attention. So the differential with
*  these models versus previous is that you have the attention is all you need paper where it's like,
*  from an information theory perspective, information is valuable in as much as it changes state.
*  So you take this whole podcast and compress it down to a few tweets. That's all you need to see.
*  But sometimes people want to see the full kind of thing. No one really wants to see the whole thing.
*  Oh, no, they do. They do. Sometimes it's quite fun to kind of do it. Because, I mean, let's say the
*  Christianson thing or they dropped to be done, right? You have a functional component, a social
*  component and an emotional component. You know, what does everyone want to go to a concert? You
*  know, what do people want to have collectors items things? Products have different aspects and
*  different elements to it. People still read full books. They don't kind of read the summaries of
*  book. They don't read the simulacrums of it. I mean, like, look, to me, there's there's there's
*  two different again, this gets into some old Facebook stuff. But like, I think we can talk
*  about let's take financial economy out of it and just talk about like informational and social
*  economies. There's the entertainment economy, right? For sure AI is going to crush the entertainment
*  economy, right? Like, there's no question about that, right? Like, you start with porn and go on
*  through and the reality is, is that, you know, we went from, you know, People magazine to your
*  friends and your friends are more interesting than People magazine and gets with more and
*  less than your friends as professional friends who are like hotter and funnier. And guess who's
*  more interesting than hot, funny, professional friends, it's going to end up being actually,
*  as it was a more tick tock was it turns out algorithmically, find the best person from the
*  universe, you'll find some niche that's better. What's better than that synthetic, right? We will
*  get to the point where say, hey, like, there will be like a hotter, funnier, more interesting,
*  more personalized AI thing, which is derived, like, I totally buy that, right. And I think that's
*  why actually, it's been funny to watch some pretty interesting influencers who are smart,
*  be like, oh my God, this is the end of the world for us, right? I agree with that.
*  Information is a very, very different beast, right? And entertainment though, right? Because
*  the value is not like engagement. That is actually, in the broad sense, the attention is everything
*  where it's totally raw, right? Which is like, that is for sure true if you're trying to optimize for
*  entertainment and is not true, right? If you actually need to know what's going on in the
*  world, right? Or you need to like, you're dealing with the real world and that interface between
*  the real world and the digital world, where the systems have no knowledge of what actually is
*  truth is to the point where I think this probably that argument falls down the most.
*  Well, I mean, maybe this is why, you know, if you say that kind of hallucinations are kind of core
*  and it's the creativity machine, media is where it's more impactful, where the truth isn't the
*  element there, right? What's happened a little bit to date is a few of the AI companies wanted to
*  talk about themselves as information machines, and they realized they can't, right? And so they'll
*  be like, we're not, instead of we're creative, don't trust us for facts is like, fine. And I agree,
*  they'll be useful entertainment machines. But I do, I think that goes into the whole like, what are
*  we actually talking about here? What are the actual value is? And like how scope is, which is not,
*  again, it's not zero. It's just not like everything. Most of our societies are based on stories,
*  you know, like all of my view on finance, pretty much all of finance is securitization and leverage
*  telling stories. And then how did you tell them? Like, and we can see the power of stories as they
*  move around. So Silicon Valley Bank was a story that was true and led to an $18 billion outflow
*  like that. All of us are kind of familiar with that. Probably listen to this podcast.
*  I think it's pretty cynical to say it's all in the stories. I mean, it's like, I think there are
*  there's reality in the world. Like the economy is not based just on storytelling.
*  No, I mean, the dollar is a story. The economy is based on the dollar.
*  And so you have the Fed confidence, you have confidence in the stock markets,
*  it's kind of layers of these things. And then you have this technology,
*  you need trust, that's for sure true. And trust, I mean, ultimately goes all the way down to like,
*  is there a military behind it, which is somewhat of a story. And that I agree with. But I think
*  that's like, a pretty abstract view, right? Like, companies earn cash flows, they're real or not
*  real, they release products, they do work, that's real or not real. It's not just storytelling.
*  What is the multiple? Maybe it's because I'm a former hedge fund manager. So I always looked at
*  what was the incremental story for a stock that just to the multiples and other things?
*  Sure. I agree that if you look at the world of multiples, you say, why do you get multiple
*  expansion or compression, right? And that's based on people's feelings about the world and future
*  cash flows, right? And in theory, that that is a lot of storytelling. I don't think that's actually
*  the vast majority of the economy, right? That's the stock market. So I think that separating out
*  what is the stock market from what's the economy is pretty important. Hey, we'll continue our
*  interview in a moment after a word from our sponsors. Omnike uses generative AI to enable
*  you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that actually work customized across
*  all platforms with a click of a button. I believe in Omnike so much that I invested in it, and I
*  recommend you use it to use cog rev to get a 10% discount. And I think this is the important thing
*  we separate it out and we see where does this technology affect? So when does it go to the
*  incumbents versus startups? Are these things kind of fundable, right? And so we have one area of
*  media. We can discuss that very concretely. I think it will have a massive impact on media.
*  At Stability, we have leading media team, right? And so we have agreement there, but we can dig
*  into that. The other area is a lot of these things are language models. Right now they're
*  chat bots and it's like, it's nice, but Bing is not the top search engine. It's not even top 20
*  on the app store, right? Because it's still a terrible experience relatively speaking.
*  Yeah. So even though some people like, well, I use it for all the things, you don't really,
*  you know, chat GPT grows really fast and it's useful for things like doing your own work.
*  But do you really use it that much? So what I find interesting is really looking at where
*  companies are trying to go beyond the basic search patterns and have the classical kind
*  of feedback loops with engaging content and see how that grows. So I think mid journey is a good
*  example of that whereby David delivery built a community, took it to like 14 million people
*  and is making money hand over fist because he built even that discord is freaking weird,
*  a good experience on existing infrastructure, Facebook app style. But how many of those have
*  you seen looking across the entire AI space? Most of the stuff right now is terrible.
*  But again, I totally go with who gets the value, right? And I think like,
*  let's talk about the internet because we actually agree on the entertainment thing. Like,
*  you know, world of closed loop, it's all about what's the most engaging thing and attention is
*  everything, right? Yes. Like these systems are like quite assuming that you don't end up getting
*  into hell, which I do think is a really big problem around human creativity and copyright
*  and a bunch of other points of legal leverage on these things. I agree that you can make really
*  compelling cases and it's going to hurt a lot of the human entertainment industry, right? That I
*  agree with. But the question is, who's going to win it? Is it going to be the Hollywood studios?
*  Is it going to be, you know, is it going to be the existing publishers who just start adding
*  incrementally more of this stuff in et cetera, or is it going to be new startups or new people?
*  You know, look, there's always exceptions to the rule, but I think almost the entire pie is going
*  to be the people who have the distribution, they have the IP, they have all the pieces they need
*  to just plug this shit in. Well, but I mean, maybe we can look at it in terms of the consumption of
*  content went to zero with streaming and kind of all these things that led to some winners coming
*  because you have Netflix, you have Spotify, et cetera. The creation of content basically goes
*  to zero with this technology as well. We may see, I believe in a few years, who will feature films
*  using this. Yeah, but I guess you can own and distribute those, right? And like the reality is,
*  I think it'll be the Hollywood studios, because they have the distribution, right? Like if you believe
*  that's kind of the distribution mechanism, but there's a whole ecosystem that can build around
*  that things like D-Neg, things like Industrial Light and Magguk, do you need that when you have
*  rendering, you know, at scale? To be clear, I think the single, I think you could totally see
*  changing or evolving is going to be the factory, right? So like, you know, meaning like, yes,
*  whether are there capital investments that people have made that will become less relevant because
*  of AI? Absolutely. There's no question. Will you almost certainly still have human writer rooms for
*  the foreseeable future? For sure, right? Like is what I would be. So there's going to be hybrids.
*  I just, I think saying that, but my basic point is that IP matters, distribution matters, like there
*  are things that matter. I agree with you that the factory plumbing in some of these places gets a
*  lot less valuable if you have better AI tooling in certain places. I just don't mean it matters.
*  Well, I think it's a bit of a disruptive innovation for that side of things, increasing the pace of
*  output. So Pixar can do six movies a year rather than two. So the question around the industry is
*  so a few weeks ago I was at Cannes and they gave a talk. So I used to be a video game investor and
*  player and I was like, the video game industry over the last 10 years has gone from 70 billion
*  to 170 billion. The average score has gone from 69% to 74%. Movies are 40 billion to 50 billion.
*  The score is 6.4 on IMDB. Are you going to be able to make better movies and have a bigger market
*  then? In which case there's more room for people to make money or is it going to be a case of
*  it cannibalizes itself? There's some key questions around kind of media, right? And media consumption.
*  In the end of the day, the media consumption thing, though, again, depending on how you want
*  to factor to look at it, it really just comes back. There's 24 human hours in a day, right?
*  And the reality is where time spent, it shifts as it comes to this stuff. For sure, time spent
*  dramatically into social, right? Off of other things, right? When that thing. Will social get
*  more compelling with AI? Absolutely, right? And so will more attention shift into Instagram because
*  of it? Absolutely. Do I believe there's going to be another platform that comes out of nowhere
*  and swipes Instagram because the cost of production goes down? Nah, right? Like, do I believe that
*  some new studio is going to come out and take out Pixar? Nah, they'll just make a few more films,
*  right? And that's cool. I'm not against that happening. I think that's completely fine and
*  people will make money on that in some places. The cost of production and therefore the war of
*  content gets more intense, for sure. You'll get to a point where like, if you don't use this stuff,
*  you're going to get fucked. But like, just because the competition level rises, doesn't necessarily
*  change the scorecard very much about how these things go. So this question of do you use legacy
*  systems or do you use new systems such as runway ML, such as one of dynamics, and some of these
*  other ones that are engineered differently? I think there's a lot of kind of legacy stuff where
*  you used to Photoshop and you used to continue to use Photoshop and now they're introducing features
*  like infill. But is there room for a ground up kind of interface? And we see that sometimes kind
*  of a character. And my assertion is broadly no, but there will be exceptions. And the broadly no
*  is going to be, it's just, it's not to your point about innovative, about is it a sustaining or is
*  it disruptive? It's like, Photoshop will get it 95% right. They already have everyone's payment on
*  file. They already have the infrastructure. This is not like the internet. People like, in the
*  internet, there was a bunch of companies that were fundamentally unprepared for this, right?
*  I do not think that most of the incumbents are fundamentally unprepared for this.
*  Yeah. And you know, there's a question of do you create brand new markets? So I was an early
*  investor in Ria, the Chinese kind of Twitch, and there was two hours a day on average per user.
*  Now on Character AI, I think it's still number two on the app store. We're seeing two hours a day on
*  average of usage, which is some insane kind of engagement metrics. It's quite nice when you have
*  a chat with it. But there's a question, can that become then a product or a network? I think that
*  we may be looking at some of the wrong areas here because what you have is you have the consumer
*  experience, the media experience and enterprise experience. I think one of the things that's most
*  interesting for me in terms of where money could potentially be made is actually the regulated
*  experience. So at Stamility, we make open models, open source, but actually what we do is open
*  auditable models for enterprise, private data, and documents, et cetera. So we've got a whole bunch
*  of stuff that doesn't have any web crawls, et cetera, employed via Bedrock and others. But I
*  think that's valuable data. So one of the things we do is kind of education. And that's where I look
*  at some of these areas and they've been the main contributors to US inflation and CPI education and
*  healthcare. And I'm like, you can do something different there. And maybe that's where a significant
*  amount of value will be. I mean, I think it's sad from the Silicon Valley story if the answer is
*  well, the money's all going to be made from regulation. I don't disagree with you for what
*  it's worth. Disrupting regulated industries, which is different. I do believe that someone's
*  going to make a lot of money on AI regulatory compliance. There's no question. AI insurance.
*  There we go. Easy one. A hundred percent. There's a bunch of things that are really sad things
*  that you have to do and people will make money on. There's no question that people will find niche
*  markets. They're super boring and not the type of thing I want to be involved in. But yes,
*  some enterprise investors will make bank on whatever Europe comes up with certifying your
*  models are compliant in GDPR 8.0 to deal with fucking data request removals. That will happen
*  as kind of the stuff happens. I'm pretty uninspired by that. I think that's pretty sad.
*  If the net income of new opportunities in AI is just going to be opportunities to interface
*  with government and rein it in, it'll be sad. Yeah, but like I said, regulated industries.
*  The example I have there is education and healthcare. One of the things we work with
*  a range of charities and multinationals on is deploying tablets into entire countries in Africa
*  with AI that teaches and learns. You give every kid a tablet, the young ladies illustrated primer.
*  What does that do to an entire nation? The only thing that's been provably to work in education
*  is the bloom effect, the two sigma effect. Right now, our kind of sister charity Imagine Worldwide
*  has been deploying the global X price for learning, adaptive learning. And we're teaching 76% of kids
*  literacy and numeracy in 13 months and one hour a day with older kids teaching younger kids.
*  I look at this technology and I'm like, there are certain areas where there is a gap, but nothing
*  could fill before. What if you had an AI tutor for every child? What does that look like? What
*  if you had 100 AI teachers for every child? I get it. And like, I do think that we can always
*  go back to the industries that tech has been trying to disrupt for a million years. And like,
*  for lots of structural reasons has not and say, ah, but now with this new tech will disrupt it.
*  I look forward to the years of debate in the, we'll talk about the US between the teachers unions
*  and people trying to deploy tablets for AI. We can say, oh, no, no, no, we're going to do it in
*  Africa, skip the regulator, like the teachers. But I'm just saying it's like, yes, there's always hope
*  that the next wave of technology will somehow on stick a bunch of problems. Technologists hate
*  because of the regulatory or the structural issues with them. But I have no confidence that this one
*  is meaningfully different. But I mean, this is the question structural issues, right? Regulation is
*  one thing. You look at kind of BGUs, some of the other Indian kind of education companies, you look
*  at the Chinese ones across emerging markets. Maybe it will be the case here. And this is what I
*  believe that much of the productivity enhancements aside from maybe coding and things like that,
*  which we can get onto, and the biggest leaps will happen in the global South, because they left to
*  mobile. And there's a whole mobile economy and massive companies created from that. What if they
*  make a leap to intelligence augmentation with this technology? Because right now they can't service
*  that. Now they could potentially service it, given the decreased cost of creativity of engagement and
*  other things from education to health care to other things. I think if your argument is that
*  there's a bunch of countries outside of the US that have lagged in a bunch of infrastructure
*  effectively, or ability to like execute certain things in education, etc. That will be able to
*  allow the cell phone have like a leapfrog moment and move forward. Yeah, I don't object to that.
*  I think that's basically true. Again, it goes back to the thing where like, I'm excited about kind of
*  the US I think lives in the future, relatively speaking to most other people and countries.
*  And like, I think the thing most people are excited about is how AI changes the top of the
*  top. I agree with that. So I think if your argument is it doesn't change the top of the top,
*  but it does kind of catch up a bunch of the third world, I do think that there are places that will
*  be true. Well, so let's look at the top of the top then. So I think Microsoft put out that 50% of all
*  code is AI generated on GitHub now from copilot, etc. And there's 40% improvement in efficiency.
*  I mean, my top coders really enjoy it because they train their own models,
*  because they have code models too, and they are showing more and better code. What do you think
*  about it with respect to that industry? Because that's obviously a large industry, which is
*  technologically disrupted. The only thing that I actually think is fucking awesome for chat GPT
*  effectively is a call it stack overflow 2.0. It's fucking great for that. And like, you think about
*  why is it great for that? Like, why? I think it is the perfect problem for the existing technology
*  we have. You have a shitload of open source code that these models can look at. Plus, you scrape
*  all of stack overflow, which is a stack overflow. And that goes back to the whole copyright issue,
*  as well as the issue of where some of the inputs come from, but most of the copyright issue.
*  Plus, the nice part about computer code is that it's test driven in a lot of cases. Either it passes
*  the fucking test or it doesn't pass the test. So you have the perfect data set of digital only
*  self-contained reality, which I totally agree chat GPT is great at. And frankly, I'm the type of
*  person who like, I code but I would never consider myself an engineer. It makes coding for me so much
*  more fun because all this shit I don't want to deal with like, what the fuck is this random error?
*  What package do I have to install to manage this? It's all great. Now it does lie and it does make
*  up the wrong answers. It's not perfect. But I fully agree that the copilot s thing is very powerful
*  and like a really great specific use case. And I do agree that like talking about business models,
*  or you know, what happens is like, like Stack Overflow is the poster child Stack Overflow is
*  the Yelp of this generation, right? You know how Yelp had this like huge lawsuit with Google,
*  it's gone on forever, because Google basically just stole their results, right? Like Stack Overflow
*  is going to be that of this because they are screwed, right? And like, it is a great example
*  of a place where the tech is better because it was basically left. Yeah. And you know,
*  it becomes very interesting as well, because now what you have is regulatory arbitrage,
*  like the good old double Irish with the Dutch sandwich on taxation, whereby Israel and Japan
*  have said you can scrape anything for any reason, which is kind of crazy, international or otherwise.
*  So maybe scrape in one area, trade in another, and you serve it up in a different country.
*  So I think this technology is kind of inevitable. But then what is the implication of that? Like,
*  my take is that as we move through the next kind of five years or something like that,
*  the nature of coding will change. Like I started coding, what, 22 years ago, we had like Assembler
*  and Subversion and stuff like that. Kids these days have it so easy with GitHub, you know, and
*  all these libraries. What does it look like in a few years when you've got these technologies
*  that you can describe something and start building apps? You know, what does the whole ecosystem look
*  like again, when the creation of these things? It will just make them much less valuable, right?
*  Like, it is what it basically comes down to. And what is remaining valuable is distribution and data,
*  right? Because like right now you can be a great engineer, solve a problem, whatever,
*  and there's like value. You can create a product that's actually worth something. If everyone can
*  make products, this is just theoretically, that are like cost nothing, right? Or really easily.
*  Then like there's just no leverage in that anymore. And again, this goes back to who wins,
*  who wins with people with distribution data, right? That's the answer. Like, if I'm existing. Now,
*  to your point of a regulatory arbitrage and data, I think this is really, I think, the sad part about
*  a lot of this AI stuff. Everything is going private, right? Like that's what the net of
*  this is going to be is like any, anything that has historically been an open data set or people
*  are able to say like, okay, well, like I'll share this, but in return, I get traffic or notoriety.
*  And that's like a fair economic trade over, right? And so what's going to end up happening is
*  walls are going to go up everywhere. Everything's going to go private. And that's going to be the
*  interesting question about where you end up from all this stuff from an economics perspective,
*  the next few years. For what it's worth, this has happened many times before, right? Like this is
*  not the first time in human history this happens. That people, if you look at a news industry,
*  people are always like, oh, like the news industry used to be so great and then whatever, it's like
*  bullshit. It's like the number of times that the history of news, basically you had growth and
*  distribution, right? Things get super spammy. The elites retreat to private newsletters,
*  like in its cycles. It's happened like six or seven times. And like, I think this is going to
*  be a hard, in some ways, I think the biggest thing is that I'm very confident of is that AI will be
*  the death of the public web and will be the death of a lot of open information, specifically because
*  of what you said, right? Which is that just will not, that it's going to be too valuable and too
*  important. The reality is AI doesn't need any more information because of your short learning.
*  But it does, it doesn't for entertainment. And that's why I think entertainment is screwed. I
*  think it absolutely, the Oracle problem in crypto, where how do you keep a system, a digital system
*  in sync with reality and being meaningful is exactly the same problem that AI has, which is
*  it can go in any direction it wants as long as the data is self-contained. The second it's not,
*  and it's trying to be synced to reality or a real world, it does need more data. It does need to be
*  continuously updated or all drifting in whatever direction, you know, it can't garner his attention.
*  But then, you know, you have public broadcasting data, you have some of these other things as
*  well, whereby the Oracle problem becomes a lot easier to do when you can do retrieval,
*  augmented models and other things like that. I mean, there are sources of verifiable data
*  for leasing. Maybe it comes down to the use case. My main point is that they're going to
*  be increasingly cut off, right? If there's no economic model for supporting them and they're
*  all getting abstracted and scraped by the model. I would disagree with this. So, you know, like
*  I made it deliberately open so that we could highlight how bad scrapes are. I think they're
*  unsafe as well. And we're the only company to loss rocked out. But we work with multiple governments
*  of national data sets and national models using broadcasts of data and other things like that,
*  that are continuously updated as national infrastructure. Because I think these models
*  are a form of infrastructure. They're a weird type of primitive. They're like a mega codec type thing
*  where stuff goes in, stuff comes out. But people do want to have relevance and updates. So I think
*  you will have an open version that is updated continuously. But then maybe again, that's where
*  value is. Which parts of information go private and are served up through models and who is providing
*  them? Is this financial data? Is it this? Is it that? And what is the quality of these fine-tuned
*  models? Because what you just described as well is a bit of an Armageddon for consumer apps in a way,
*  right? Because it goes down to zero. So now what becomes useful is that then the Apple takes a
*  massive leap forward because they've got this identity structure and they have all the data
*  they can do apps quicker than anything else. Yeah, except for the fact that Apple's entire
*  shtick about encryption and privacy is going to make it literally impossible from the plan.
*  I actually think Apple's role in the future of this stuff is going to be one of the most interesting
*  big tech questions because they have positioned themselves so hardcore against all the things you
*  would need to get leverage right from AI, that it's going to be very interesting to see how they
*  navigate. Google, fine. Meta, fine. But I am very skeptical of what Apple's AI approach is going to
*  be. Or I will say on the flip side, they're incredible at government relations and PR.
*  So if they have to figure out a way to totally recant on all their encryption and their
*  approaches to this type of stuff and have a new model where they somehow are the privacy heroes,
*  but also doing AI, I'm very curious how that's going to work. They can keep a
*  encryption and they can keep a customized model because again, you don't need to take everyone's
*  data to train it. You have a generalized model. I think you have local models, many models on your
*  local device with a general model behind it. Exactly. I think in practice, we'll see how it
*  plays out. It works with an embedding layer potentially, but it is kind of very interesting
*  because again, the technology doesn't matter. It's the use that matters. What use can you get
*  out of it? So yesterday they had the thing whereby they said, oh, it learns automatically
*  with a little ML model in there. It learned through a small embedding layer. They don't talk about
*  the technology that much because Apple always just talks about what the use actually is.
*  But I think the question is, what is disruptive? What can engage more? What could attract more?
*  And so I think that you've got apps coming down there, which is why the bar generally rises.
*  I think we see this with technology as it goes. The bar generally rises and so attention becomes
*  even more difficult where it does come down to distribution. But I mean, what's your take on the
*  nature of morality in this type of age? Because these things are good at optimizing for morality
*  potentially, right? Like again, you can build better content. You can build better engagement
*  once you get the bottles down. And that is the start of many of these apps.
*  Yeah, I just think virality is a war, right? In a lot of ways. So like, look, I think,
*  you know, in the end of the day, it's like, will newsfeed get more compelling for people? Absolutely.
*  Right. Will ads get more compelling for the individual? Absolutely. Right. Like, there's
*  no question these things are true and the existing players will get the vast majority of the pie of
*  that type of stuff. You know, I do think you'll tend towards more and more niche interests, right?
*  So like, let's talk about like porn for a second. Like porn is always fascinating. It's like a
*  leading edge thing on this type of stuff. It's like, you can go on Reddit and sign the weirdest
*  fucking porn in the world of all these sub communities that like have filtered into these
*  like weird things that they're interested in, right? AI will make this 10 times weirder, right?
*  And like, or if 100 times weirder, right? And like people are just going to keep filtering. Now,
*  why does this like weird filtering happen? Right? Like, I mean, there's a bunch of reasons and
*  different things. I think part of it, moving away from porn for a second, the broader ecosystem,
*  people are desperate for a sense of purpose and place, right? And like the reality is the internet
*  makes you feel very small because there's millions of people just like you. And that encourages
*  people to seek out right size communities that are smaller and smaller with AI, right? I think the
*  interesting thing will be when it comes to attention and things like that is look, for the first time,
*  every single person can have hundreds of characters that like and support them all the time,
*  right? Like the math of it all, right? You know, used to be okay, like you're trying to find a
*  community that's the right size and knows you that you have a price and you're valued in,
*  right? But like, it's hard to you're not necessarily the hero, right? So you go find
*  out a smaller niche or different niche where you're more of the hero or like you create a
*  spin of it and try to lead that, right? I think a future where like, basically you log into social
*  media or whatever, and you're like, Hey, I'm Sam. It's like, cool, what type of people is it? Who
*  do you want to follow? It's like, who do you want to follow you? Right? And like you end up with
*  like hundreds of AI characters, or frankly, I think what's more likely is it the mix of humans
*  AIs and you're not really sure which is which, but they're caught, they're the ones commenting
*  on your posting, like you're fucking great. But like, here's a cool question or whatever. Like,
*  I think that's the world we're going to end up on is like more and more segmented niches, right?
*  Where the ultimate end would be the her model where it's like, you just have one AI girlfriend.
*  I'm not sure we'll go there. I think that's really hard to pull off. And I think like this,
*  that's a tough thing. But if you told me that like, in the future, you know, on Twitter,
*  good example, you know, everyone has 100,000 followers, right? You're not exactly sure who's
*  a person and who's a robot, right? And they all fucking love you. And it makes it super compelling
*  and you feel great. Like that's a very plausible future. Oh, man, birth rates are going to do that.
*  And you see that chart of young male virginity under 13, the US for the Washington Post,
*  they went from 8% in 2008 to 27% in 2018. Did you see what happened with replica on Valentine's
*  Day this year? So replica was originally an app that was designed to be your mental health buddy,
*  right? Until they did realize you could charge $300 a year for erotic role play. Until the 13th
*  of February, 2023, when they get a message from Apple saying shut this off. So on Valentine's Day,
*  they shut that off. And then 68,000 people joined the Reddit the day after and said,
*  why'd you lobostomize my girlfriend? You know, like, it was quite a massacre.
*  That's where we're going. And look, there's a whole history. I mean, again, like, we'll go back to
*  porn for a second. Like the whole it's always fascinating. It's like such an interesting
*  base human thing. But it's like, look, it's like the whole dynamic of like, you know,
*  you know, how Tinder has affected sexual inequality, right? It's like, fascinating.
*  Like, there's all these really interesting studies on this, like technology has a deep impact on this
*  type of stuff, right? But if people ultimately want care about validation, titillation, whatever
*  it's going to be, there's no question that place one place you, you and I will agree is that AI
*  does dramatically shift the power on these things, they will end up with weirder subcommittees.
*  And he's saying, here's my question to you, though, we talk about power dynamics, I still think,
*  and in this, I might be wrong about I will admit, because it's a little bit of a niche, weird
*  industry. But my bet is that Pornhub is still the winner. I actually assume they're the biggest
*  porn company, like I or whatever Reddit is, it's like the place porn is doesn't shift the
*  platform's own shift. It's just going to be like, weirder, weirder stuff, and more and more AI
*  generated. I don't know. I mean, to be honest, Pornhub is an app, so MindGeek is the company
*  behind it. They were just bought by ethical capital partners. Because, you know, life is weird.
*  Reddit could be a big winner of this. But I think, you know, I've been already like Reddit is already
*  just full of porn, right? So it's like, I just assumed more for I'm sure they're gonna be very
*  smart about this, you know, and engaging porn. But really, what you're saying is going along AI
*  wifes, you know, like, this kind of loneliness that they fill in, that could be a good investment
*  team. Because again, you have the whole hololive stuff that then emerges to these engaging people.
*  I think it's gonna happen. But I don't think it's a good investment. And like, let me just go back
*  to like, just because it's gonna happen doesn't make it a good thing to invest in. And like,
*  to me, it's really unclear where the leverage is in that, right? Like, it's like, you're,
*  you'd have to believe that somehow you're going to have dramatically more compelling characters
*  than like the next company also provide. Right? Or you'd have to believe that like, I just don't
*  know, there's any lock in, I think, and I don't think there's any like other and so it's really
*  unclear, just because it's gonna happen doesn't make it an investment.
*  Well, I think there is kind of if you kind of look at hook dynamics, there is kind of that trigger
*  reward kind of dopamine rush and lots of stuff that you invest into each character. So there's
*  probably gonna be a lot of first mover advantage here. On the other side, you have the licenses,
*  you have the IPs that can be brought to this, like not on the porn side, but there's a whole
*  gamut from porn to your mental health buddy, right? I mean, I think ultimately, if you're basically
*  saying, is there a solution to loneliness and solution to making you feel good, there's a whole
*  gamut of different things that can happen here, where you've got IP wave, but these other things,
*  again, the example I think that comes from that is the hollow life influences, they're going up
*  like that. Not to push you with it. I mean, it sounds like you're agreeing with me, which is
*  like the leverage is an IP, right? Or the leverage is in distribution, right? For this type of stuff,
*  because the pure tech stuff to it, it's like, yes, there'll be good jillions of, you know,
*  virtual girlfriendy, whatever things, but it's not those are not platforms you can invest in. And
*  they're not really valuable, even if there's a lot. I think bringing it all together is something
*  that will take time. So I think there will be a lot of first and mirror advantage. So like with
*  stability, again, data distribution, a key, right? So my thing is take the best of open,
*  which we stimulate, and we fund lots of build the stable series of models of every data and
*  distribution to it. So open data, licensed data, national data, and then we take it through cloud
*  system integrators on prem, and I take a share of all that revenue. So I agree, that's kind of
*  pulled to a good business. But what I'm saying is, I don't believe in this particular area,
*  going from poor at one end to mental health, buddies in the other end, there are established
*  distribution networks. I think there'll be a lot of opportunity there for first mover advantage.
*  Sanyam Bhutani In the history of investing,
*  first mover advantage has generally turned out to be a pretty bad investment.
*  Okay, maybe not first mover advantage, let's say, first proper entity advantage that takes advantage
*  of classical good company dynamics. There aren't good companies there yet.
*  Jason Bahl Yeah, maybe. Again, I think it's a little
*  hard to know exactly. There's a huge spectrum here. It's hard to like exactly react. But I would say,
*  look, I think we're agreeing that like, entertainment is gonna get more entertaining,
*  right? And too hard to produce, right? I think we're agreeing that IP is very valuable,
*  and maybe it's more valuable. So maybe the answer is, buy Disney stock. Because Elsa is going to be
*  a way cooler character when she like, that's kind of obvious. And like, I think we can all agree on
*  that. I think what is not clear to me is outside of the IP plays outside of the existing distribution
*  plays, like, what IP what AI really unlocks is a new disruptive vector for this type of stuff.
*  Because I don't I do think that there are some pure AI type things you can do. I mean, we'll
*  talk about the AI girlfriend thing is just unclear what the payoff is there, right? Because they don't
*  have any modes. Well, I think if you look kind of you can scale a certain type of human endeavor,
*  shall we say, for example, there aren't enough therapists in the world, you know, and it is a
*  regulated industry. But at the same time, there is a gap for therapists, just like you have the
*  meditation apps kind of step in. And they created calm, they created these other things that were
*  huge. Now this is more engaging. So I think one of the areas to look at is where can you not find
*  enough people that can fill in some of these things and then build good experiences around that if
*  you're looking at companies that can come to the fore, because there isn't an existing solution.
*  This is why, like I said, for me, I look at the global south, I'm like, there's lots of gaps.
*  I looked at kind of here. And there's again gaps, where are the gaps that you want to go,
*  because you can basically create a market, you can fulfill a key customer need. And so again,
*  I looked at mental health in particular. And that goes again from the porn AI wife's all the way
*  through to proper mental health kind of therapists, there's a huge gap in that particular market. And
*  there's a huge chasm of loneliness. And a lot of products that could be built, they're generally
*  useful. And that can go quite fast enabled by this technology where they were not enabled
*  by the soul. I think this has been fascinating. I have kind of a handful of concrete prediction
*  questions that I kind of want to get you guys on record with if you're up for it and see if you
*  have similar concrete predictions are different. And then we can obviously check back in on in the
*  future. How does the market for inference shape up? And for a jumping off point? How do you think
*  it might look different from the current cloud infrastructure market? I think it's going to be
*  the vast majority, but I think it's like GPUs to assets with Bitcoin mining. Because these are big
*  research artifacts that apply to it. But the output is a little tiny pile of binaries. And that's not
*  a complicated thing to run inference on. They seem French to you on Amazon cloud, you see kind of
*  the TPU v5s and others. I think there'll be more and more customized solutions as you move from
*  that research to engineering bit. And then the cost competition goes massive in a few years time.
*  Over the next few years, I think there'll be a shortage, everyone will try to use this technology,
*  there would be enough. And then eventually, it'll move towards the edge. Because I think there's just
*  orders of magnitude optimization that we can do from here. Yeah, I mean, this is a little bit
*  beyond my direct wheelhouse. But I think in the end of the day, what I'd say is like, I highly
*  suspect because the distribution is indifferent, right, and the patterns aren't different. And any
*  of this stuff that you're going to see is everything from chipsets, all the way through
*  to cloud providers, things look basically the same as they do today. Everyone's just making more money.
*  Yeah, I think inference is also interesting because in the cloud, you just move to wherever
*  the cheapest inferences for these models. And so it's quite a mobile thing. So you've got Nvidia
*  coming hard for that reason. Question two, what happens to the price of primary care medicine in
*  the United States over the next 10 years? Unfortunately, given the issues, I think it's correct.
*  It should go down. The regulatory capture is far too strong. And there's something major, major
*  happens. Question three, you guys both have kind of said there's a ton of junk out there. It seems
*  like broadly, we're not expecting that many major incumbents to be disrupted. What would you guess
*  would be like the most likely incumbents to be disrupted if you had to pick some? Stack overflow?
*  I think they'll pull by 1.6 billion by process, right? Whoever owns that. I mean,
*  I think the process is probably fine. You know, you've seen disruption in Chegg and other things.
*  We didn't really get into this, but I do think that some SaaS companies with less switching costs
*  will be at risk from some of these higher context window companies where you can put 10,000 words
*  and instructions in, because some of them are relatively basic in that way. Actually, for
*  Wordsworth, I think we once again, mostly agree. The only thing I think is at risk are things like
*  Zapier, right? Or some of these like kind of like, and it's kind of a 50-50 because they also get
*  way more powerful. But I think there's a bunch of SaaS tools that probably end up looking more
*  like features where they used to look maybe like companies because of AI. But real incumbents,
*  like public big multi-billion dollar companies, I mean, I don't think any of them are really at
*  risk. I think they're all just going to get stronger. I think a bunch of startups or series
*  A companies are going to get swiped out or all of a sudden not going to be able to grow, right?
*  Because I think the big guys will just get better faster. Will the big tech companies that are
*  currently open sourcing, for example, Meta, Salesforce, will they continue to do so or will
*  they stop? Well, I think Meta has moved to non-commercial open source for all their open source.
*  Now, Salesforce is kind of continuing to do full open source. I think it's just very difficult
*  because the regulatory environment become tougher and tougher and it's not core to their business
*  to open source. I think that it would be 100% driven by business models, right? So like Meta,
*  if you think about it, is incredibly well positioned, should generally the level of AI
*  continue to grow in the world, right? If you think about it, it's like the way they're going
*  to monetize that is having dramatically better ads, right? And like dramatically better content
*  in a bunch of ways. And so I think they have a heavy incentive. Think about it to like keep
*  open sourcing it. They want the talent, they want, you know, the reason companies also open source
*  is like, there's like a real internal external interplay, right? In terms of how you build an
*  ecosystem that attracts great talent. So I think it'll still keep happening. But I think the list
*  of people who are supporting open source stuff will shrink, right? If that makes sense, as people
*  get super competitive about this stuff and the battle lines are drawn. If you had a billion dollar
*  company, you know, of any kind, could you come up with a story? Could you identify a type of company
*  that should not, you know, where it wouldn't make sense or let's even frame it more decisively,
*  where it would be defensible to not be investing, say at least a million dollars in figuring
*  generative AI out today? In other words, is there anywhere where this is not relevant?
*  I mean, I'm sure there is, but nowhere I can think of offhand. I think it's relevant just about
*  everywhere, just because you always get a level of productivity increase. But you know, as Sam said,
*  for a lot of industries, this is a stating innovation. It's just the next stage as opposed
*  to massively well changing, shall we say. What happens to the marriage rate and the birth rate
*  in say, the United States, as AI companions of all sorts become available?
*  It clearly goes down everywhere. I mean, like look at South Korea, they're at 0.8 now on their
*  fertility rate, thanks to video games and a few other factors. There are negative and positive
*  ways to spin this actually, like I think I personally, I have the negative take on this,
*  like I think that's the future and a bunch of other things. But here's the reality. It's just
*  a simple economics thing, which is like if the world is more entertaining, then like that makes
*  doing unentertaining hard long things like having kids and raising them like less appealing. Right.
*  It's like Tinder, Tinder is going to hurt the birth rate. Like AI is going to hurt again,
*  it's a sustaining innovation, which is technology generally is going to hurt the birth rate.
*  Yeah. And then you see places like Japan where you've got declining birth rates,
*  really embracing this because they want the productivity increase, which is the other flip
*  side of this. So it'd be more productive, less people. Yeah. I mean, that's the irony that you
*  talk about a lot in the diamond age you referenced earlier, like a really long-term sci-fi story is
*  pretty simple, which is like a highest, highest, highest level, like technology will drive there
*  to be fewer people. And then because there are fewer people, we need more technology. Right.
*  And like it becomes a symbiotic thing. That's the really sad part. I mean, like it's all sort
*  of people thinking about like, oh shit, like the entire human population is going to fall off a
*  cliff. Right. It's because we're like entertaining ourselves to death.
*  Do you think any AI leader, you know, open AI right now, or somebody who takes, you know,
*  the leading position from them in terms of having the best model can sustain super high gross
*  margins for a few years into the future? Based purely on the AI? No. It needs to be
*  distributed and data. I think the proprietary side, it's yes, unless it's super data unique,
*  you're going to zero. I think that you have Google and open AI as uneconomic actors,
*  and that's incredibly difficult. You know, so just to unpack that, you mean that basically
*  they won't allow, they don't intend to make a ton of money on this and they won't allow many
*  miles to either because they're going to provide it at cost. They don't care about, yeah, they're
*  quite under cost to get the data. You know, again, they have different business models. Google cost
*  shifts all the time, right? This is why I went to the other side for open models to private data
*  and standardizing that. No one's making money on open models alone. Well, I mean, there is a way.
*  There is a way. So basically what I do with my business model is standardizing it and then
*  providing all the services around it as a blueprint for my partners to take forward. Yeah, I mean,
*  like there's a consulting Nexus version of this, like that you can probably pull off again,
*  consulting models. I think, again, I was saying you're pursuing, but very difficult.
*  I build the models. I give it to my consulting partners and they take it forward. That's why this
*  is my theory of stability has been a partial theory. It's obviously a lot of facets to the
*  organization, but I kind of view stability as the provider for like the non-aligned countries,
*  if you will, like those that are like, we definitely don't want to buy from
*  corporate America. We want to own our own. We want control. Those folks seem like they have
*  nowhere close to the resources domestically to build their own systems, but they do have kind
*  of a point of pride and also just practicality, right? Like if you're an African government and
*  you want to get your own legal system into a language model, you know, who's going to do that
*  for you? That feels like a real sweet spot for stability. How much of the future do you think
*  is kind of serving that kind of third set of countries? No, I mean, look, we're creating
*  subsidiaries and dozens of countries, bringing all the top family offices for data and distribution
*  and national models and national data sets based on broadcasted data. We take a subset of that,
*  make that open, and we've got the rest of that for our commercial side.
*  So I think the Global South is the focus for us. Plus, there were these big multinational companies
*  building dedicated teams with them because we're the only company in the world that can build you
*  a model of any single model to your type. Is that sustaining? Who knows? But it's a decent business.
*  And so my thing was build a decent business, doing decent stuff, doing something different
*  to other people. I'm sure there'll be more competitors, but again, let's see how it goes.
*  Omniki uses generative AI to enable you to launch hundreds of thousands of ad iterations that
*  actually work customized across all platforms with a click of a button. I believe in Omniki so much
*  that I invested in it, and I recommend you use it too. Use Cogrev to get a 10% discount.
