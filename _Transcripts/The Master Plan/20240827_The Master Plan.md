# VIDEO John Gardner Confronting CREEP Over Secret Campaign Donations 1972
**The Master Plan:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CBgg76RNfpQ)
*  In partial response to a court suit brought by Common Cause, the so-called citizens lobby,
*  the president's re-election committee agreed this week to reveal the details on some previously undisclosed financial contributions.
*  Last night, shortly before a court-ordered deadline, the information was made public.
*  ABC's David Schumacher reports.
*  The Republicans offered to send their list of contributors over to Common Cause by special messenger,
*  but John Gardner said no thanks. He'd come by personally to pick it up.
*  We're here to see Mr. Moore, Mr. Powell Moore.
*  Mr. Moore?
*  Yes, John Gardner, Michelle Rogovin, Ken Guido to see him.
*  Okay, fine. We'll meet him right out.
*  Mr. Moore did not come right out, but a security man did, and he tried to block photographers.
*  Well, we've been asking the press people to get out of here. Just don't touch me.
*  Okay, wait.
*  All right, don't touch me.
*  The security man finally gave up, and so did Gardner.
*  After waiting in vain for 25 minutes, he walked back to his office, leaving lawyers behind to pick up their list,
*  reporters elbowing lawyers for their own copies.
*  That's it.
*  Back at Common Cause, a quick total for Chairman Gardner, just under $5 million.
*  Heading the list, Chicago insurance man Clement Stone.
*  A million dollars reinforcing rumors he's about to be appointed ambassador to Great Britain.
*  Next, $800,000 from Richard Scape of the wealthy Mellon family.
*  Arthur Watson, former ambassador to France, gave $300,000.
*  John Mulcahy of New York, host to the president on his trip to Ireland, 255,000.
*  Not all the names were as well known as DeWitt Wallace of Reader's Digest or John Whitney Payson of the New York Mets,
*  and Common Cause volunteers searched their files for background.
*  The executive committee of W.T. Grant Stores.
*  Okay, he's good for...
*  See that, $1 million for Clement Stone.
*  Anything.
*  Yeah, okay, take this over to the next station.
*  DeWitt Wallace, Wallace.
*  Forgotten for the moment in the excitement that the Republicans still have not identified their contributors for the month of March,
*  the month the committee to reelect the president pushed hardest for big money.
*  The court suit on that is still to come, but there was enough information on hand for now to keep the lights at Common Cause burning through the night.
*  David Schumacher, ABC News, Washington.
