*  Let's imagine for a minute it's January 1973. You're in your car driving home after a long day.
*  Let's say it's a wood-paneled Buick.
*  You're stressed about work. You're scanning through radio stations, but all of the news coming out of Washington is bad.
*  Nixon, days away from his second inauguration, is trying everything he can to distance himself from a growing scandal.
*  Senate Democrats have chosen North Carolina's Sam Ervin to investigate the Watergate bugging case.
*  The committee would have full subpoena power and a half million dollar budget.
*  There are new protests every day.
*  Free our system! Free our town!
*  What do we want?
*  Need a home!
*  It's exhausting. So you flip the radio over to the AM dial. You find WARM 590, a station that serves northern Pennsylvania and parts of New York.
*  Mr. Businessman, have you read the Powell Memorandum?
*  You're thinking, the Powell Memorandum? What the hell is that?
*  It just might be the most important single document regarding the free enterprise system ever written.
*  Who is this guy they're talking about? Lewis Powell?
*  The same Lewis F. Powell, who is now a member justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, prepared an in-depth study entitled Attack on American Free Enterprise System.
*  Okay, so this is a recreation, but we based it on the actual word-for-word transcripts of a series of radio editorials that WARM 590 presented on the topic of...
*  A growing menace in this country, which threatens to choke to death our system of free enterprise.
*  You rev the Buick engine and squeeze the steering wheel. The speaker describes how this new threat is not from your typical commies and radicals.
*  No, no, no. This new enemy is even more dangerous.
*  People in college classrooms, people who reach the public through radio and television and newspapers and magazines, people in our own community.
*  Their numbers aren't all that big yet, but their weapons are powerful, an ability to talk, to write, and to influence public opinion.
*  They match this with an almost religious devotion to one goal, destroy free enterprise in America.
*  You, in your Buick, are the Mr. Businessman this editorial is talking to.
*  You work hard. You pay your taxes. You think the American system is pretty great.
*  This Powell memo they're talking about is stirring something in you.
*  You realize it's time to get off the sidelines and join the fight.
*  In the last episode, we told you about how Lewis Powell came to write his manifesto, and we ended with the question, did it actually mean anything?
*  Was it just Lewis Powell's early version of an angry Reddit thread that went into the ether?
*  Or, as some claim, was it much more?
*  Did oligarchs and activists use it as their step-by-step blueprint for the takeover of major American institutions?
*  Well, after two years of research and the discovery of some documents that have never seen the light of day, we finally have the answer.
*  We all know the history of the many social movements in the 60s and 70s.
*  Civil rights, the environment, women's lib.
*  But in this episode, we're going to tell you about the movement you've probably never heard of, the Powell memo movement that began the process of legalizing corruption in America.
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Masterplan.
*  If you've been listening to Masterplan and thought this stuff sounds familiar, it's because today we live in a world controlled by money, and it's corrupting everything from the food we eat to the movies we watch.
*  And each week on Levertime, we expose how they did it.
*  I'm Arjun Singh, and every week David Sirota and I host Levertime, the Lever's weekly business and politics podcast.

*  When we left off in the previous episode, Lewis Powell's memo had been leaked to the media and it stirred a minor controversy because the FBI did not include it in its report to the senators voting on Powell's Supreme Court nomination.
*  I'm here with our producer Jared Jekang-Mayer.
*  So Jared, fill us in on what happened to Powell after the memo became public.
*  So that was in the fall of 1972, and Powell had only been on the Supreme Court for less than a year.
*  And in his personal papers, I found letters from business executives and other high-profile friends offering their support and some of them asking, hey, can I get a copy of this memo?
*  But Powell was always careful about maintaining the appearance of impartiality.
*  He called it part of his, quote, sterilization as a judge.
*  And he would always refer inquiries to his buddy, Gene Sidner, over at the Chamber of Commerce and say, go get copies from them.
*  And as we've said before, Powell never addressed the memo publicly, right?
*  No, he didn't really need to because the controversy only stayed in the news for a couple of weeks and then basically went away.
*  Powell never talked about it, and it doesn't seem like he was ever even asked about the memo for the rest of his life.
*  Like it almost never even happened.
*  Yeah. And it was frustrating because when I was at the Powell archives digging through his papers, I could see these little snippets, these references where you could tell something more was going on.
*  Meetings, campaigns, things that had been set up around the memo.
*  At the Chamber of Commerce?
*  Yeah. And I looked there at the public archive for the U.S. Chamber, and it goes back more than 100 years, but I couldn't find much.
*  I had to start looking further afield at other archives and libraries around the country, just connecting the dots between people who might have been involved at the time.
*  And eventually I came up with a pretty clear picture of what transpired in the years after the Powell memo was leaked.
*  You mean the vast shadowy conspiracy?
*  Yeah. Well, it does involve the names of powerful people that you would probably recognize.
*  To be fair, some of these figures were already part of the conservative movement that was emerging in the 1970s.
*  But it does seem like the memo came at the exact right moment in time to steer many of these folks in the same direction.
*  The business roundtable, the head of Procter & Gamble, Charles Koch, Roger Ailes.
*  Dude, dude, dude, are you about to say Pepe Silvia?
*  Because this kind of feels like it's that scene in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia where Charlie covered the office walls with those sheets of paper connected with red lines.
*  Pepe Silvia, this name keeps coming up over and over again.
*  Every day Pepe's mail is getting sent back to me. Pepe Silvia, Pepe Silvia. I look at the mail. Well this whole box is Pepe Silvia!
*  David, have you been spying on me in my basement?
*  Okay, but you're right. This is all very expansive and interconnected, and a lot of names keep showing up.
*  So for the purpose of this episode, I want to hone in on three previously unknown gatherings that were specifically focused on the Powell Memo.
*  We're going to go from Florida to Dallas and then to D.C.
*  Okay, so let's start in a place where everything seems to break bad. Florida.
*  Walt Disney World is more than just a place. It is a complete vacation destination where guests may stay as long as they like.
*  At the Polynesian Village, there is a leisurely atmosphere of the South Seas and trade winds.
*  Orlando, March 1973. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Public Affairs Committee organized a three-day conference at Disney World's Polynesian Hotel.
*  And it was the first big meeting of a group called the Task Force on the Powell Memorandum.
*  Come on, man. There was actually a Powell Memo Task Force, and they met at the Polynesian Resort in Disney World, like, for real? For real, for real? For real.
*  The Great Ceremonial House dominates the scene in a setting that is lushly tropical.
*  And for each guest, there is a feeling of coming to a tiny island in the South Pacific to stay and play.
*  I'm imagining newly planted palm trees and white sand beaches. The tiki torches are burning. The Cinderella Castle is off in the distance.
*  The super futuristic monorail is gliding along an elevated track. And in the middle of all this magic and joy, you're telling me there are a bunch of stuffy white dudes in wide lapel 70s suits wandering around the lobby of this new hotel?
*  And imagine that everyone is clutching their copies of the Powell Memorandum.
*  So how did this happen?
*  Well, the main coordinator behind this gathering was a guy named William G. White. He was the top lobbyist in Washington for United States Steel, one of the biggest steel producers in the world.
*  He was also picked to serve as chairman of this newly created Powell Memo Task Force. We'll talk more about White in a minute. But first, I want you to check this out. It's a roster of other Task Force members.
*  OK, let's see. There's I'm looking here. OK, there's Richard Jenks, president of CBS. There's Jay Van Andel, who co-founded Amway with the notorious Richard DeVos.
*  Let's see. There's top brass from Phillips Petroleum. I also see a bunch of executives here from JCPenney, 3M, the American Medical Association, General Motors, deans from a couple universities.
*  This is a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, but not like your local Chamber of Commerce.
*  This isn't a gathering of mom and pop shops from Main Street America.
*  This is like the elite of the elite, the masters of the corporate and political world hanging out at Disney World.
*  It really is a small world, David.
*  And you've got to read this, too. Here's a copy of the actual agenda.
*  So it looks like attendees were first greeted at a reception aboard the Eastern winds, an authentic Chinese junk ship that apparently doubled as a floating cocktail lounge.
*  As their spouses and families took in a hula performance or hit the water slides, the corporate guys got down to business in the Micronesian conference room.
*  One session was called interpreting business, a think tank session on how to, quote, enhance the image of business.
*  They also exchanged ideas for how to sway public opinion through, quote, economic education, which was a big theme of the Powell memo.
*  OK, so then there's a nine a.m. to noon session on political action.
*  It was a workshop focused on the Powell memo's recommendations to increase political effectiveness and, quote, what more the chamber and business community can do to develop more political clout, political clout.
*  Another core message of the Powell memo. And it was the most pressing topic of this meeting.
*  Now, let's go back to the organizer of this event. U.S. Steel lobbyist William White.
*  This wasn't some everyday hack.
*  One observer described him as, quote, the dean of the corporate Washington establishment.
*  And White was not just a fixture on K Street.
*  He was the ringleader among a new breed of corporate public affairs specialists.
*  These were guys that brought together lobbying, legislative know how, legal pressure and media skills, all in service of growing clients, political influence.
*  And the lobbyists know the truth.
*  The easiest way to pull strings in Washington is to control politicians with campaign money.
*  And here's where it gets really interesting. Midway through the conference, White left the Polynesian hotel and jumped in his car.
*  I bet it was something like a wood paneled Buick.
*  And jumped in his proverbial wood paneled Buick and headed to the Orlando airport for an important pickup.
*  He wasn't picking up bags of dirty cash like in episode two.
*  White was there to give a lift to his longtime friends Jerry and Betty.
*  Jerry was once an obscure Republican congressman from Michigan.
*  But at this point, he was on a glide path to something much bigger.
*  I, Gerald R. Ford, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office of president of the United States.
*  Yes, that Jerry. Gerald Ford, who is still in Congress, but later that year will become vice president.
*  And soon after that, president.
*  Officially, Congressman Jerry came to Florida to take part in another work-related junket on the invitation of William White.
*  A junket paid for by U.S. Steel, of course.
*  But instead of heading to a golf course, Gerald Ford was going to the happiest place on Earth to schmooze and collaborate with the Powell Memo Task Force.
*  According to the conference schedule, the honorable Gerald R. Ford was the official speaker at the luncheon on Friday.
*  But there may have been an ulterior motive for his participation in that day's session, strategizing about the upcoming congressional elections and about how to deal with legislation that was problematic for the master plan, the Federal Election Campaign Act.
*  So remember back in episode two, we told you that Ford signed the amendments seeming to make Fika even stronger when he became president.
*  So this is right before that, when they are discussing those amendments.
*  When Ford did sign those amendments, it was seen as a big win for the reformers, not the master planners.
*  They are at Disney World.
*  And for the most part, Fika was a win for common cause and the reformers.
*  But the master planners were desperate to get around Fika's restrictions on corporate funded political action committees that funnel money to politicians and political parties.
*  This Powell Memo meeting at Disney World was where they perfected their plan.
*  I got a letter for you to read, David.
*  This was written by one of the attendees a week before he went to Disney World on behalf of his boss, John Merrill Olin.
*  Olin, the wealthy industrialist. We'll talk more about him later.
*  In this letter, the executive writes about the Powell Memo task force in intimate detail, especially their lobbying effort to amend the regulations around corporate campaign donations.
*  He wrote, quote, We should be able to get many companies to follow our own pattern of political fundraising.
*  He's talking about political action committees, PACs.
*  And without getting too far into the weeds, the corporate guys at this Orlando meeting wanted an exemption to an older law that was standing in the way of huge multinationals like the Olin Corporation from dumping money into corporate PACs.
*  The effort was being opposed by common cause and a senator from Wisconsin named William Proxmire, who was threatening to filibuster.
*  Check out this line, quote, I have suggested to some of my corporate associates that we might contribute to a special fund to have Senator Proxmire get a few more hair transplants, provided the operator drills a little deeper this time.
*  OK, so they're like joking about murdering Senator Proxmire, basically, or at least lobotomizing.
*  Yeah. And we know that Ford was there.
*  We know that amending FICO was a major item of discussion at the meeting.
*  And we know that the meeting took place right before Ford's keynote speech to the Powell Memo Task Force.
*  So let's review. While drinking Mai Tais at Disney World's Polynesian Hotel, the master planners are specifically scheming to end restrictions on corporate PACs.
*  And they're schmoozing directly with Gerald Ford, the then House minority leader on his way to becoming president.
*  And then guess what? A provision killing those restrictions ended up in the FICO reform bill that Gerald Ford first dealt with in Congress and then later signed into law as president.
*  Wow. What a shocking coincidence.
*  Remember what Ford said in episode two when he signed the bill into law?
*  All the compromises that were necessary in the process.
*  I guess now we know where some of those compromises came from.
*  So under the guise of post-Watergate campaign finance reform legislation, the master planners from this Powell Memo meeting ended up creating their first corruption loophole.
*  And as soon as that law took effect, there was an immediate explosion in campaign spending by corporate America.
*  No more secret bags of dirty cash smuggled through airports, a la Nixon.
*  The chamber wanted all of its members to write checks for millions of dollars to totally official, totally legal and extremely powerful business PACs.
*  But back to Disney World, the master planners honed their plan to keep the money flowing into politics.
*  But what else did they decide?
*  Well, the vision laid out in the Powell Memo was so multifaceted and expansive that they realized that executing it would be really hard.
*  It needed to be more sophisticated and broad based than any effort previously undertaken by the business community.
*  It probably seemed super daunting.
*  Yeah, well, if you're going to wish upon a star, you know, this is a place to do it.
*  But either way, they got down to work.
*  The documents we unearthed show that the task force members, there were about 50 of them, were divided up into subcommittees for each of the core tenants of the Powell Memo.
*  You had communications, education, political action and judicial action.
*  They were instructed to spend the next several months intensively analyzing and considering Powell's words.
*  They were told to, quote, to reach beyond to blue sky their thinking and not to limit themselves just to the Powell Memo as they develop their ideas for the chamber.
*  Remember that key line in the Powell Memo?
*  Strength lies in organization, in careful long range planning and implementation, in consistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of financing available only through joint effort.
*  In other words, to borrow a phrase from the civil rights movements of the previous decade, they needed to do some coalition building and spread the gospel.

*  Follow it all with new episodes every weekday on the NPR Politics podcast.
*  The mid-20th century was fertile ground for political manifestos.
*  It seemed like you couldn't walk 10 feet without tripping over some pivotal work inspiring a new social and political movement.
*  There was the Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan for the feminist movement.
*  Rachel Carson's Silent Spring for the environmental movement.
*  There was Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals.
*  There was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter from Birmingham Jail which became a galvanizing text for the civil rights movement.
*  And don't forget the granddaddy of them all, The Little Red Book by Mao Zedong.
*  They always carry Chairman Mao's works with them and study them everywhere and anytime.
*  But this was the challenge for corporate conservatives in this era.
*  They didn't have anything like The Little Red Book.
*  And this was a problem for them.
*  Although I do like the idea of the conservative mystique.
*  Well, they did have books like Barry Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative.
*  And they did have figures like William F. Buckley on TV and radio.
*  But if they were going to create a movement to counter the left, they needed something that would not only inspire the insiders and power brokers and elites.
*  But also something that would motivate the masses.
*  And this is why I'm skeptical about whether the Powell Memo was leaked to the Washington Post without the knowledge of the top leadership at the Chamber of Commerce.
*  Because right after the memo went public in 1972, you see that the Chamber is immediately publishing it and distributing it far and wide.
*  They mailed thousands of copies to members.
*  They printed it in their official magazine with an elaborate design treatment like it was some mysterious quasi-religious text that must be read.
*  It really was kind of like the conservative movement's version of the anarchist's cookbook.
*  It was kind of like contraband, a publication that everyone had heard about but wasn't on the newsstand.
*  And even though the Powell Memo was never an officially published book, according to the Chamber's estimates, hundreds of thousands of copies of it were circulated.
*  Reaching millions of Americans and sparking numerous discussions and speeches and articles, it was an underground bestseller.
*  And by early 1973, activity around the memo was intense.
*  So intense, in fact, that at the same time Gerald Ford was at Disney World delivering his keynote address to the Powell Memo Conference,
*  it turns out there was another event, a rival event, about the Powell Memo that was happening at the Marriott Hotel in Dallas, Texas.
*  At the same time?
*  The same exact day, March 30th, 1973.
*  I want to show you this. These are notes taken by a man named John A. Howard.
*  Howard came from the world of academia and he was the president of Rockford College in Illinois.
*  He was an influential figure in the emerging conservative movement at the time.
*  This Dallas meeting looks like it was organized by members of something called the YPO.
*  The Young Presidents Organization. It was a social club for executives and owners of smaller businesses and it's still around today.
*  In early 1973, the YPO orchestrated a series of gatherings, Powell Memo parties, if you will, for members who wanted to fight the fight.
*  That sounds like a hippie love-in for angry middle managers.
*  Yeah, pretty much. And Howard was one of the attendees at the Dallas meeting and he saw the Powell Memo as a way to build a new ideologically driven movement.
*  At the YPO meeting, there was a focus on the part of the Powell Memo that talked about the seeming paradox of how...
*  Most of the media, including the national TV systems, are owned and theoretically controlled by corporations, which depend upon profits and the enterprise system to survive.
*  So at this Dallas meeting, the assembled businessmen start asking, why couldn't corporations leverage their power as advertisers to shape the news coverage from media outlets they sponsor?
*  And on this topic, Howard was impressed by a young TV producer who had helped Richard Nixon get elected.
*  He noted, quote,
*  Hang on, hang on, hang on. Don't say the name yet. Can we get some more ominous music here?
*  Okay, there we go. Okay, go ahead.
*  That young man's name was Roger Ailes.
*  I don't believe anyone will ever be elected to a major public office again without the skillful use of television.
*  Roger Ailes.
*  Roger Ailes.
*  Roger Ailes.
*  Wait, wait, like THE Roger Ailes?
*  Yep, Roger Ailes, the founder and former CEO of Fox News.
*  Here's what John Howard wrote about Ailes' presentation. And, David, you should read this part.
*  Okay, let me take a look.
*  Quote,
*  Wait, wait, whoa, whoa.
*  This is pretty annoying.
*  Yeah, and John Howard loved this idea.
*  At the time, Ailes was an up and coming TV producer turned political consultant.
*  loved this idea. At the time, Ailes was an up-and-coming TV producer turned political
*  consultant. His ideas about shaping public perceptions through media, it found a receptive
*  audience at this Dallas meeting, as well as other meetings that he attended about the
*  Powell memo.
*  Dear listener, if you've ever looked at the Republican Party of today and wondered,
*  how did country club Republicans and the grand old party of Abraham Lincoln wind up in bed
*  with hard-right libertarians? And how did Fox News become the obnoxious bullhorn of
*  the conservative movement? This is the moment when those coalitions started to form. The
*  Powell memo served as the connective tissue.
*  And to be clear, the hard-right libertarian faction was different from the Chamber of
*  Commerce crowd at Disney World.
*  The libertarians had previously felt marginalized in the Republican Party. While the pro-business
*  Republicans at Disney World wanted favors from the government, the libertarians were
*  anti-government ideologues who wanted to tear it all down.
*  We're talking about direct descendants of the robber barons of the Gilded Age who were
*  committed to the destruction of the federal government bureaucracy that was expanded under
*  the New Deal. But in 1973 and 1974, you had these convergences, some bigger and more formal,
*  some smaller and more intimate, where the Powell memo served as a unifying document.
*  Its promise of freedom and enterprise went viral among both groups and brought them together.
*  So how did something go viral before the internet? It's not like this was at the airport bookstore.
*  No, it wasn't something you could get at the newsstand. The Chamber of Commerce sent the
*  memo to its members directly and then it spread organically from person to person, probably
*  using snail mail and lots of Xerox copies.
*  Imagine some vice president of a company opens up his mailbox and finds a copy of the memo.
*  He loves it so much that he makes a copy.
*  Then the memo arrives at the mansion of wealthy industrialist John Olin, who inherited his
*  fortune from his family's chemical and munitions empire in the 1930s.
*  So Olin is like, oh my God, this guy, Lewis Powell, this guy is saying everything that
*  I've been thinking.
*  Olin would go on to dump hundreds of millions of dollars into conservative think tanks,
*  media organizations, and become a main backer of a conservative legal group called the Federalist
*  Society.
*  We'll talk about the Federalist Society in depth later in this series.
*  Then the Powell memo shows up in Wichita, Kansas at the estate of Charles and David
*  Koch.
*  The Koch brothers.
*  I don't even think we need to explain the impact of the Kochs, but the Koch brothers
*  are recognized as some of the biggest financiers of conservative politics.
*  Their father built an empire in oil and gas, and they inherited his business along with
*  his hardcore libertarian ideology.
*  And Charles, we know, found inspiration in the Powell memo.
*  In 1974, he read an excerpt of the Powell memo to a group of like-minded conservatives
*  and said he didn't think it went far enough, actually.
*  So he co-founded the Cato Institute, another think tank dedicated to stuff like deregulating
*  campaign finance.
*  These guys really took to heart Powell's urging to play the long game, to invest money
*  in creating alternative institutions to shift the country in a whole new direction at every
*  level.
*  Another copy gets made.
*  Now imagine the memo arriving at the estate of Richard Mellon Scaife, the mogul who inherited
*  his family's oil and banking fortune.
*  Wait, wait.
*  Scaife's name came up in episode two.
*  He was one of Nixon's secret donors who got exposed by that common cause lawsuit.
*  $800,000 from Richard Scaife of the wealthy Mellon family.
*  Yeah, and after reading the Powell memo, Scaife began a decades-long mission to funnel hundreds
*  of millions of dollars into conservative causes and organizations.
*  That includes the Heritage Foundation.
*  Yes, exactly, and this brings us to our last figure.
*  A copy of the memo arrives in Golden, Colorado at the headquarters of Coors Brewing Company.
*  Joseph Coors, a grandson of the company's founder, told a historian that the Powell
*  memorandum stirred him and made him realize American business was, quote, ignoring a crisis.
*  So he tapped his family's brewing fortune for a venture led by Roger Ailes, which laid
*  the groundwork for what would evolve into Fox News.
*  But his biggest investments were put toward making radical changes to the intellectual
*  and policy landscape of Washington, D.C.
*  He became one of the first and biggest funders of the Heritage Foundation, which was founded
*  in February 1973.
*  For listeners who vaguely recognize the name of the Heritage Foundation, it's probably
*  because the organization and its policy agenda have been touted by Republican presidents
*  for the last four decades.
*  You don't have to trust me on that.
*  The 2024 Republican vice presidential nominee, J.D. Vance, explicitly said that, writing,
*  quote, the Heritage Foundation isn't some random outpost on Capitol Hill.
*  It is and has been the most influential engine of ideas for Republicans from Ronald Reagan
*  to Donald Trump.
*  And Vance wasn't exaggerating when he wrote that.
*  Here's Ronald Reagan in the 1980s.
*  I mentioned the things that were on the minds of conservatives at the moment, the importance
*  of the Heritage Foundation, the remarkable work of Joe and Holly Coors and so many of
*  you in this room in bringing to Washington the political revolution.
*  And here's what you've been hearing in the news about Donald Trump.
*  The conservative Heritage Foundation leading this draconian and at times extreme policy
*  plan project 2025, a 900 page sort of wish list or proposal for the second term.
*  And just as such an incredible job, and they're going to lay the groundwork and detail plans
*  for exactly what our movement will do.
*  So there it is.
*  Another direct line from Lewis Powell's manifesto to the present era.
*  In this case, from the Powell memo in 1971 to project 2025 today, the Powell memo inspires
*  oligarchs to fund the Heritage Foundation and the Heritage Foundation then became the
*  author of the agenda of the entire conservative movement all the way into this current moment
*  that we're now living through.
*  But back here in 1973, this was all still underground.
*  Just a bunch of ideologues, eggheads, activists and oligarchs cross pollinating with one another.
*  So the question for the master planners at this early moment in the 1970s was how do
*  they take the Powell memos ideas and start implementing them?
*  How do they begin infiltrating the courts and infiltrating American culture?
*  That's where we're going next.
*  Hackers and cyber criminals have always held this kind of special fascination.
*  Obviously I can't tell you too much about what I do.
*  It's a game.
*  Who's the best hacker?
*  And I was like, well, this is child's play.
*  I'm Dina Temple-Reston and on the Click Here podcast, you'll meet them and the people trying
*  to stop them.
*  We're not afraid of the attack.

*  Let me set the scene.
*  It's November 12th, 1974, 19 months after the meeting at Disney World with Gerald Ford
*  and the meeting in Dallas with Roger Ailes.
*  The last leaves are dropping off the trees and Richard I'm Not a Crook Nixon is gone.
*  I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow.
*  Congressman Jerry from the Disney World meeting is now President Gerald Ford, and he's given
*  Nixon a get out of jail free card.
*  A full, free, and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the United
*  States.
*  At this point in 1974, Lewis Powell has settled into his job on the Supreme Court, developing
*  a reputation as a reasonable moderate, and the general public has forgotten about the
*  leak of his memo.
*  The Powell memo task force, however, has been busy implementing the recommendations of the
*  memo.
*  And here at this meeting in 1974, there was likely a deep sense of urgency.
*  Just days before the gathering, the Master Planner's Republican allies in Congress saw
*  historic midterm losses in the post-Watergate election, sweeping in a new wave of liberal
*  reformers.
*  Earlier, I said I wanted to talk about three important meetings.
*  This is the third and final one.
*  It doesn't have tiki torches and Mai Tais.
*  This gathering is being held at the Chamber of Commerce's headquarters in Washington,
*  D.C., located right near the White House.
*  And I found the actual seating chart.
*  Check out the names around this table.
*  Let's take a look here.
*  Okay, there's William Baruti, President of the conservative think tank, the American
*  Enterprise Institute.
*  And he's sitting next to Barton Cummings, the bow tie wearing head of one of the nation's
*  biggest advertising agencies and chair of the ad council.
*  I see Gene Sidner, the Richmond, Virginia businessman who first got Lewis Powell to
*  draft his infamous memo to the Chamber of Commerce.
*  And two seats away from him is John Howard, the president of Rockford College who attended
*  the Dallas meeting.
*  Of course, there's a representative from Jay Van Andel who co-founded Amway with Richard
*  DeVos.
*  And all around the table, you can see top brass from pro-industry lobbying groups.
*  The Council of Better Business bureaus, the National Association of Manufacturers, and
*  the newly formed Business Roundtable that, along with the Chamber of Commerce, would
*  define a new power structure on Capitol Hill for decades to come.
*  So Jared, did you find audio from the meeting?
*  Sadly, no.
*  But I did find the typed out speakers notes from the presentation.
*  So how about we do another reenactment?
*  All right, through the magic of podcasting, let's go now into the room where this secret
*  meeting took place.
*  Who controls the British crown?
*  Who keeps the metric system down?
*  No, it wasn't quite like the stone cutters on The Simpsons.
*  No purple robes or weird symbols.
*  These VIPs were probably all wearing suits and ties.
*  As the men settle into their seats, everyone turns to the head of the table to listen to
*  the convener of the meeting, William White, the U.S. Steel lobbyist who'd coordinated
*  that previous meeting at the Polynesian Hotel and who'd just finished assisting with his
*  friend President Gerald Ford's transition into the White House.
*  All right, gentlemen, let's get started.
*  White begins by explaining how, after a year of closely studying the Powell memo, the Chamber's
*  Board officially approved a plan of action around the conclusion that there were, quote,
*  "...four mandatory areas in which business must concentrate its efforts if it is to achieve
*  acceptance with the general public."
*  Yeah, you heard that right.
*  America's corporate titans are sitting at a giant table in a Roman-columned fortress
*  just one block from the Oval Office where their pal Jerry is now literally the leader
*  of the free world, and somehow they perceive themselves as the victims struggling for acceptance.
*  Imagine Darth Vader and the Emperor at the control panel of the Death Star lamenting
*  that they're unpopular and have no power.
*  Anyway, White addresses the big question.
*  How are things progressing with the master plan?
*  Quite well, it seems.
*  The room goes dark and a beam of light from a slide projector shines onto the screen.
*  White explains how the task force's lobbying helped convince Congress to amend the new
*  election laws to allow for corporate PAC spending just as they had planned back at Disney World.
*  Congress has enacted most of the reforms we sought, and notably we helped to stave off
*  that drive for public financing of Congressional races.
*  Now White moves on to the next issue, judicial action.
*  You may recall that the Powell memo recommended mimicking Ralph Nader's focus on the courts,
*  filing lawsuits designed to get specific policy outcomes, and amicus briefs pressuring judges
*  to deliver specific rulings.
*  Since expanding the program, the Chamber has participated, or is in the process of doing
*  so, in 13 cases.
*  White brags that the Chamber has participated in cases over things like whether unemployment
*  benefits should be paid to striking workers, or changing the guidelines for how chemicals
*  can be discharged into waterways.
*  We have been successful in gaining our point of view in important instances, and we expect
*  these judicial actions to be one of the most far-reaching and productive elements resulting
*  from task force recommendations.
*  White says the Chamber has educational programs, symposiums, and conferences going on nationwide.
*  To create a rapport and a better understanding of our private enterprise system among youth
*  and educators.
*  They're giving lesson plans to teachers.
*  A new package of audiovisual materials to increase economic understanding that includes
*  slide presentations about profits and productivity.
*  Our profits kit is a best seller.
*  White mentions a pilot television program with the Texas Council on Economic Education.
*  Entitled Everybody Knows What Profit Is, the entire series may run to 30 films with a budget
*  of $5 million.
*  Sounds like must-see TV!
*  Their media outreach effort is massive, now including
*  70 television stations, 225 radio stations, and 300 newspapers.
*  Just like the one on AM radio that we heard at the top of this episode.
*  White concludes,
*  A lot has happened since last November, but of course much more needs to be done.
*  Okay, so here's the question.
*  What then was done after this meeting?
*  What specifically?
*  Well on the media front, they launched an operation to change the hearts and minds of
*  normie Americans.
*  One guy in that room, a powerful advertising executive named Bart Cummings, spearheaded
*  a massive PSA campaign through the ad council.
*  Wait, I thought ad council ads weren't political.
*  I remember them being really mom and apple pie kind of stuff.
*  Like Smokey the Bear.
*  Right, but in the 1970s, Jerry Ford's administration partnered with Cummings and the ad
*  council to do a comically ideological ad campaign promoting capitalism.
*  The ad council's membership included corporate giants like Procter and Gamble, Mobile Oil,
*  Exxon, and William White's own U.S. Steel.
*  Again, this campaign was all done in partnership with the U.S. government.
*  Architect Dolores Gould, what's your IQ?
*  138.
*  And your EQ?
*  EQ?
*  Your economics quotient.
*  Oh, I don't know much about economics.
*  The ad seemed ripped right out of the Powell Memo itself, touting the American economic
*  system.
*  Who makes the American economic system work?
*  I don't know.
*  Right.
*  And that's a problem.
*  Yeah, and the ad sponsors had a solution to this problem.
*  More Powell Memo inspired propaganda.
*  They put up billboards, ran magazine ads, and aired radio spots.
*  Cummings and the ad council highlighted all of this as one of their best PSA campaigns
*  ever for how effective it was in building the American public's support for free market
*  capitalism.
*  And remember the film projects that the Chamber of Commerce said it was putting into production
*  as part of the Powell Memo task force?
*  Well this is one that the Chamber released in 1976 for the 200th anniversary of America's
*  founding.
*  Happy birthday USA.
*  Narrated by Jimmy Stewart.
*  What do you get for a country that has everything?
*  Well almost everything.
*  Government bureaucracy is becoming a paternalistic monopoly that is burying us in paperwork and
*  red tape.
*  It stifles initiative and it erodes the basic self-reliance which is our American legacy.
*  So Jimmy Stewart, the guy who in 1939 played an earnest government reforming outsider in
*  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, he was working with Washington insiders in 1976 to convince
*  the public that the government is the problem?
*  If allowed to continue, it could bring an end to freedom and enterprise.
*  Okay so in less than five years a secret manifesto has mushroomed into a nationwide celebrity
*  studded multimedia propaganda machine that's literally reshaping how Americans think about
*  capitalism.
*  But what about the plan to legalize corruption?
*  How's that going?
*  Well they're definitely working on it.
*  You heard that they helped weaken FICA but they weren't stopping there.
*  Remember this part of the Powell memo?
*  Neglected opportunity in the courts.
*  The master planners knew that they had to solidify their agenda in the courts.
*  Right around this time the Chamber of Commerce began building the foundation of what would
*  become the National Chamber Litigation Center and other groups that now routinely secure
*  favorable court rulings on stuff like campaign finance.
*  An example of one of those new Powell memo inspired groups is the Pacific Legal Foundation
*  which becomes a litigation powerhouse thanks to an early boost from this guy.
*  Some time ago I talked about an organization called the Pacific Legal Foundation.
*  It's a non-profit public interest law firm which dedicates itself to upholding the Constitution
*  and protecting the public interest against such special interests as the so-called welfare
*  rights groups, government bureaus, and those ultra-environmentalist organizations which
*  would deny you and me the right to swat a mosquito.
*  This is Ronald Reagan.
*  Thanks for listening.
*  By the end of 1974, after all these secret meetings, the master plan's key pieces are
*  now in place.
*  The Supreme Court now includes the author of the Powell memo.
*  The president is a guy who attended the meeting to organize the memo's implementation.
*  The public is being immersed in the memo's ideology.
*  And now outside organizations like the Pacific Legal Foundation have been built.
*  And they're ready to begin moving the justice system towards legalizing corruption.
*  Now it's just a matter of finding the right opportunity.
*  And here in the mid-1970s, that opportunity is about to present itself.
*  We'll hear arguments today in Buckley against Vallejo and others.
*  Counsel, you may proceed whenever you're ready.
*  That's next time on Master Plan.
