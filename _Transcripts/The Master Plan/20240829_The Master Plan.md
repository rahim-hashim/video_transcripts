# Lewis Black Reads the Powell Memo! From Master Plan Podcast, Episode 3
**The Master Plan:** [August 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3slU7l5Y5mY)
*  Okay, I want you to imagine that it's 1971 and you're Lewis Powell and you're at the
*  grocery store in Richmond, Virginia picking up a carton of Marlboro cigarettes.
*  Hang on, Powell didn't smoke.
*  Hmm, interesting.
*  Guess he knew the cancer data after all.
*  Anyway, so you're Lewis Powell and you're buying a carton of milk and you're waiting
*  in line at the register, daydreaming about how much you hate commies and hippies.
*  And there on the newsstand, you spot the latest issue of Fortune magazine.
*  So you start leafing through it.
*  And who do you see being heralded in a nine page profile?
*  Consumer advocate Ralph Nader.
*  Ralph Nader.
*  Ralph Nader, that crusader for consumer protection.
*  In 1971, 37 year old Ralph Nader was on fire.
*  His legal crusades made him literally a celebrity.
*  He was involved in everything from exposing corporate fraud to exposing political corruption,
*  including Nixon's dairy scandal, which you heard about in episode one.
*  Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, filed suit today charging that the administration
*  and the dairy industry illegally set up political front organizations.
*  Ralph Nader charged today that General Motors had violated the federal automobile safety
*  law.
*  If you think about what Nader's done all by himself in Detroit and in Washington and elsewhere,
*  Multiply that by say 15 times.
*  If you could have firms of people who were doing this kind of thing, you'd be changing
*  the equation of power in the state.
*  So if you're Lewis Powell in this imaginary checkout line at the grocery in Richmond,
*  Virginia, and you spot your nemesis, Ralph Nader on the newsstand, you're now having
*  an apoplectic meltdown.
*  This guy you can't stand is now so famous that he's being profiled in your business
*  And now he's mounting a new crusade to pass the campaign finance laws that could stop
*  you and your corporate allies from buying the politicians you need to get the policies
*  you want.
*  Okay, so maybe it wasn't in a grocery store, but we do know that this 1971 fortune piece
*  on Nader is the thing that really drove Lewis Powell over the edge.
*  So what's that mean, over the edge?
*  So Powell goes and meets up with a longtime friend who also lived in Richmond, a guy named
*  Gene Sidner.
*  He had served in the Virginia State Senate, was extremely pro-business and was the CEO
*  of a chain of department stores.
*  But most importantly, Sidner had recently become chair of the Education Committee of
*  the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and he had high-level connections with the group's leadership in
*  Washington, D.C.
*  If any one organization could turn the tides on what Powell saw as the country's biggest
*  It would be the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the most powerful business lobbying organization
*  in Washington.
*  Yeah, but first he needed to convince the Chamber to go big, bigger and more audacious
*  than they had ever gone before.
*  So Powell got to work writing, and by the end of the summer, he'd completed this 34-page
*  typed document, complete with section headings and footnotes.
*  Wait, wait, wait.
*  Did he use his dictaphone?
*  Please, Jared, tell me you found Lewis Powell recording his memo.
*  No, and believe me, I literally spent a year trying to find it.
*  It was my white whale.
*  I mean, if you would have found that...
*  It could still be out there.
*  But we came up with the next best thing.
*  We found another famous Lewis who could capture the outrage dripping from the text of this
*  memo.
*  Can you hear me?
*  Talk to me.
*  No, I can't see you at all.
*  Not a fucking thing.
*  Hello?
*  Talk to me.
*  Oh, come on.
*  This is crazy.
*  Wait, wait.
*  The comedian, the guy who literally plays the anger emotion in my kid's favorite Pixar
*  movie?
*  Yes, exactly.
*  We got Lewis Black to read Lewis Powell's memo for us.
*  There you are.
*  Unbelievable.
*  All right.
*  All right, hold on.
*  I'm going to close the door here.
*  Ready?
*  All right.
*  Let's do it.
*  Confidential memorandum.
*  Date August 23rd, 1971.
*  From Lewis F. Powell Jr.
*  As you'll hear in his memo, Powell was a man who was extremely deliberate in his choice
*  of words.
*  No thoughtful person can question that the American economic system, variously called
*  the free enterprise system, capitalism, and the profit system, is under broad attack.
*  And for this, Powell chose language that was explosive.
*  The broad shotgun attack on the system itself.
*  There are constant rifle shots which undermine confidence and confuse the public.
*  This is language meant to stir emotions.
*  Business has been the favorite whipping boy of many politicians for many years.
*  This is language that defined a common enemy.
*  Perhaps the single most effective antagonist of American business is Ralph Nader, who,
*  Thanks largely to the media, has become a legend in his own time and an idol of millions
*  of Americans.
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa.
*  Hold on.
*  What happened to the Lewis Powell that everyone described as Mr. Nice Guy?
*  I can't imagine him ever saying a harsh word to anyone.
*  Well, this is Mr. Angry.
*  Powell is basically sounding an alarm about hippie barbarians at the gate.
*  If our system is to survive, top management must be equally concerned with protecting
*  and preserving the system itself.
*  This wasn't just a rant, though.
*  Powell had a plan to address the problem, a plan that could be executed by corporate
*  America.
*  It had just a few simple steps.
*  Step one, spread conservative ideals in higher education.
*  The campus, as these bright young men from campuses across the country seek opportunities
*  to change the system, which they have been taught to distrust, if not indeed despise,
*  they seek employment in the centers of real power and influence in our country.
*  I see.
*  Just bright young men, huh?
*  Yeah.
*  This is peak Mad Men era.
*  Powell said the chamber can change the campus by funding various programs, including
*  a staff of scholars, staff of speakers, speakers bureau, evaluation of textbooks.
*  Then we get to step two, change the media.
*  Television, the national television network should be monitored in the same way that
*  textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance.
*  Powell wrote that infiltrating radio was also important, as was scholarly journals, books,
*  paperbacks and pamphlets, paid advertisements.
*  Next up, step three, the neglected political arena.
*  Pump money into politics and elections.
*  Businesses must learn the lesson long ago learned by labor and other self-interest groups.
*  This is the lesson that political power is necessary, that such power must be assiduously
*  cultivated, and that when necessary, it must be used aggressively and with determination,
*  without embarrassment and without the reluctance, which has been so characteristic of American
*  business.
*  The chamber of commerce should consider assuming a broader and more vigorous role in the political
*  arena.
*  And finally, step four, the most important section by far, an area where Powell had unique
*  expertise, take over the courts.
*  The judiciary may be the most important instrument for social, economic and political change.
*  Powell saw the legal system, especially the Supreme Court, as an underutilized front where
*  business could be much more assertive.
*  Perhaps the most active exploiters of the judicial system have been groups ranging in
*  political orientation from liberal to the far left.
*  Powell wanted businesses to use the courts offensively to create a legal environment
*  that was more favorable to their interests.
*  Powell told business leaders to rip a page from the playbook of consumer advocates like
*  his nemesis, Ralph Nader, who made his name filing public interest lawsuits.
*  The Powell memo advised corporate executives to pursue their own lawsuits to challenge
*  regulations and decisions that they felt were harmful to business interests.
*  The American Civil Liberties Union is one example.
*  It initiates or intervenes in scores of clauses each year and it files briefs, amicus curiae,
*  in the Supreme Court in a number of cases during each term of that court.
*  Even if the chamber wasn't directly involved in the lawsuits, Powell suggested that business
*  groups should be more active in filing amicus briefs, special legal documents submitted
*  by outside parties who want to influence judicial rulings.
*  The greatest care should be exercised in selecting the cases in which to participate or the suits
*  to institute.
*  But the opportunity merits the necessary effort.
*  And then, like any good business plan, Powell brought up the most important factor, money.
*  And lots of it.
*  This is a vast opportunity for the chamber if it is willing to undertake the role of
*  spokesman for American business and if in turn business is willing to provide the funds.
*  Powell wrote that for a massive program like this to be successful, it must be a long-term
*  with significant staffing and resources which would require far more generous financial
*  support from American corporations than the chamber has ever received in the past.
*  He concludes the memo doing his own version of Karl Marx's Workers of the World Unite
*  sign off.
*  Only he implores corporate leaders to get on board and start cutting checks or face
*  extinction.
*  Really, it's more of CEOs of the World Unite.
*  But this would be an exercise in futility unless the board of directors of the chamber
*  accepts the fundamental premise of this paper.
*  Namely that business and the enterprise system are in deep trouble and the hour is late.
*  Louis F. Powell, Jr.
