# Episode 1 Milk Money  Master Plan
**The Master Plan:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1s4-wB3pzQI)
*  This is corruption. This is bribery. Don't let it stand.
*  This corruption is an American issue.
*  We live in a corrupt nation. A nation corrupt to its bones.
*  We have reached a saturation point of corruption at the federal level.
*  It is corrosive on society because nobody has any trust or belief
*  or puts any legitimacy in our institutions anymore.
*  When I say the word corrupt, what jumps into your mind?
*  Maybe you think about a file on your computer's hard drive not working
*  or the blue screen of death. The file has been corrupted.
*  The DX has corrupted my system.
*  Maybe you think of some faraway regime on the other side of the world
*  where government officials get rich while everyone else starves.
*  Somalia has held the title of being one of the world's most corrupt countries for the past decade.
*  Maybe you think of something from pop culture, like the Nevada senator
*  and the godfather demanding a bribe from the Corleone family.
*  Or maybe you think of the wire's walking bribery machine, Clay Davis.
*  Shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit.
*  If you're a Republican political junkie, this is probably what comes to mind.
*  Burisma, a Ukrainian natural gas company, paid Hunter Biden millions of dollars
*  to serve on its board of directors.
*  And if you're a Democratic political junkie, I'm guessing you think of stuff like this.
*  Trump told the group that they should donate a billion dollars to his presidential campaign
*  because if elected, he would roll back environmental rules that he said hamper their industry.
*  Corruption in politics is the process of using money to break the machine of government,
*  so that the machine no longer benefits the public.
*  It only benefits the wealthy and powerful.
*  Now, there's the corruption of, say, a cop taking a bribe to rip up a speeding ticket,
*  or a government official diverting public highway funds into their own pocket.
*  This kind of petty corruption is bad.
*  But greedy individuals will always exist, which makes this kind of small-time graft inevitable,
*  even in the best-run governments.
*  But then there's systemic corruption.
*  The kind of corruption that's become so pervasive and so common
*  that you start to assume, oh well, that's not even corruption.
*  That's just how things work.
*  Deep down, you sense that there's a glitch,
*  but it's hard to pinpoint the problem when you see it everywhere.
*  It is all around us.
*  You can feel it when you go to work,
*  when you go to church,
*  when you pay your taxes.
*  This is the deep, systemic corruption that now pervades America.
*  And you get a glimpse of it every time you hear about how much money
*  is flooding into politics and elections.
*  Morgan, billionaires spending a record $880 million in the midterms.
*  Spending projected to reach, get this, nearly $11 billion.
*  Judy, we are seeing a storm of campaign spending.
*  An ultra-secretive Chicago industrial mogul
*  has quietly given $1.6 billion to the architect of the right-wing takeover of the courts.
*  This kind of all-consuming corruption does not occur naturally.
*  It's not inevitable.
*  It is created by people who want to trap us inside a system of bribery,
*  graft, and dishonesty because that serves them.
*  So who exactly designed this dystopia we're now immersed in?
*  The Lever's team of investigative journalists has spent the last two years
*  digging into archives and lost audio, searching for that answer.
*  And we've finally found it.
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Masterplan.
*  In this first episode, we'll eventually go back 50 years
*  to start exposing the epic story of how corruption was legalized in America.
*  But first, let me tell you where this story started for me.
*  Can you pinpoint the exact moment when you realized how corrupt and fubar everything was?
*  I can. It was after a pre-dawn bus trip to Canada.
*  Sarah Conjue joins us live now from the U.S.-Canadian border in Highgate with more on the story.
*  Sarah?
*  Roger, it's a matter of consumers paying one price here in the U.S.
*  and a different price just 40 feet from where I'm standing.
*  It was the year 2000.
*  I was a few years out of college following my dreams of good government and progress
*  that I'd seen on the West Wing.
*  I scored my first big job in politics working for a then obscure New England congressman
*  who'd started busing seniors to Canada in search of lower-priced prescription drugs.
*  So then the question comes, why is it that the same exact prescription drug
*  manufactured in the United States of America is sold here in Canada or in Mexico or in Europe
*  at far, far lower prices than that product is sold in the United States?
*  That is insane.
*  He was right. It is insane.
*  And he had a plan to fix it.
*  A bill that would allow American pharmacies to buy cheaper drugs from Canada
*  and sell them to Americans at the lower world market prices.
*  It was a common sense idea that seemed popular in both parties.
*  Some Democrats even started campaigning on the issue in the 2000 election.
*  I worked for one of them in Montana, a farmer running for Senate
*  who was organizing similar bus trips to Canada.
*  We didn't ask people when they got on those buses for Canada if they were Republicans or Democrats
*  or libertarians or vegetarians.
*  We only asked them if you would like to make a difference.
*  We said that we would embarrass Congress into action.
*  And over a year ago when we started these trips,
*  Congress had never heard about the problem about prescription drugs.
*  Now everybody's got a solution.
*  The pressure campaign worked.
*  More lawmakers from both parties sponsored the bill.
*  It got votes in the House and Senate.
*  It passed Congress and President Bill Clinton signed it.
*  To 25-year-old me, it seemed the system had worked.
*  There was a problem.
*  The public pressured its government.
*  The legislative machine went to work.
*  And the wrong was righted.
*  America, fuck yeah!
*  But then the hammer came down.
*  Congressional plan to reduce Americans' medical costs today ran smack into a roadblock.
*  I remember hearing the news.
*  I was in my tiny D.C. apartment.
*  Secretary of Health Donna Shalala, in a letter to the President,
*  has now scuttled the plan by citing serious flaws and loopholes
*  which undermine the potential for cost savings.
*  The trickery was grotesque.
*  Lawmakers issued their press releases touting the passage of a bill
*  that promised to lower the cost of prescription drugs.
*  But the pharmaceutical industry had been funneling millions of dollars to both political parties.
*  And lobbyists got their allies in Congress to slip a loophole into the bill.
*  Then the Clinton administration used that loophole to kill the program
*  before it could ever go into effect.
*  Since she couldn't certify that American consumers wouldn't get lower prices,
*  she didn't want to hold out false hope
*  and be involved in something she thought was not legitimate.
*  The Clinton White House made this announcement right after Christmas,
*  when everyone was on break.
*  The kind of timing often used in Washington
*  to make sure nobody notices something bad is happening.
*  The whole thing reeked of corruption.
*  And today, the price of medicine continues to skyrocket.
*  Last January, prices of more than 800 medications went up.
*  It hurts those without insurance, and even those with it.
*  My innocence was gone.
*  After a few more years on Capitol Hill,
*  I left Washington, D.C. bitter, bruised, and disgusted.
*  I felt like Rowdy Roddy Piper in that old cult movie, They Live,
*  when he found sunglasses that let him see all the monsters destroying society.
*  I wanted some justice,
*  which was the perfect attitude for becoming an investigative journalist.
*  I have come here to chew bubble gum and kick ass.
*  And I'm all out of bubble gum.
*  Oh, shit!
*  I started firing out stories that exposed politicians
*  who were taking money from health care giants,
*  Wall Street banks, and defense contractors.
*  I wrote a few best-selling books, hosted a radio show,
*  and launched the investigative news site, The Lever.
*  I even helped come up with the story
*  for the Oscar-nominated movie called Don't Look Up,
*  which featured a corrupt White House
*  letting its top donor try to profit off a comet
*  that was hurtling towards Earth.
*  This comet actually contains almost $140 trillion worth of assets.
*  Fuck 40 trillion.
*  What do these trillions of dollars even matter if we're all going to die?
*  Oh, no! What if we're rich and we're safe?
*  I'm proud of what I've accomplished in my reporting on corruption,
*  but over the years I also started to understand
*  that each instance of corruption was a symptom of a whole system
*  created by a master plan to legalize corruption in all of its forms,
*  from buying elections to bribing public officials with gifts and campaign cash.
*  Over the next 10 episodes, we're going to expose the blueprint
*  that created this system,
*  and we'll expose it by doing the thing that journalism used to do all the time.
*  Show me the money.
*  Show me the money!
*  Show me the money!
*  No, not that. This.
*  Follow the money.
*  What do you mean?
*  Just follow the money.
*  Why follow the money? Why expose this master plan?
*  Because your life is worse than it should be
*  thanks to the corruption of American democracy.
*  Trouble earning enough to pay your credit card bill and your rent?
*  You can thank the corporate donors who delivered cash to lawmakers
*  who then blocked a minimum wage increase,
*  blocked rent control, and blocked the cap on credit card interest rates.
*  Are you one of the 112 million Americans who struggle to pay for health care?
*  You can thank the health insurance companies,
*  who funneled millions of dollars to lawmakers
*  to make sure they keep America as the only industrialized country
*  without government-guaranteed medical care.
*  Sweating climate change?
*  Look no further than the mountains of money that fossil fuel companies give the lawmakers
*  to let those companies continue incinerating the atmosphere.
*  I think back two decades ago to those bus trips up to Canada
*  and all those seniors trying to get the medicines they needed to stay alive.
*  Those seniors were victims of a system of corruption
*  that's been legalized over decades.
*  Now you may be wondering, if corruption is so bad,
*  why would anyone want to legalize it?
*  Because the oligarchs, operatives, and opportunists
*  who are executing the master plan don't like democracy.
*  They want minority rule for themselves.
*  And they understand that in a properly functioning
*  one-person, one-vote democracy,
*  they would never be able to gain control of the political system
*  and then enact the self-enriching and ideologically extreme policies they want.
*  They understand that to get their way,
*  they must be allowed to buy elections, legislation, court rulings, and public policy.
*  This master plan started about a half century ago,
*  so that's where we're going next.
*  After the break, we're taking you back to the year 1971,
*  just before this master plan was hatched.
*  It was a time when we almost got this problem of corruption under control.
*  It was an era when hope and progress flowed like milk.
*  The year is 1971.
*  Hot pants were hot, bell bottoms were swinging,
*  and peasant tops were all the rage.
*  Progress is in the air.
*  There are thousands of protesters descending on Washington
*  to demand the end of the Vietnam War.
*  The Lorax is a brand new bestseller,
*  and disco is just starting to emerge on the music scene.
*  Even stuffy old Washington, D.C. felt like a place where things were possible.
*  In less than a decade, public pressure had compelled lawmakers to create Medicare,
*  Medicaid, civil rights legislation, voting rights legislation,
*  and the Housing and Urban Development Department.
*  The United States government had officially declared war on poverty.
*  A Republican president had signed legislation creating the Environmental Protection Agency.
*  A new super agency to pull together all the federal efforts now underway
*  and to come up with some new ones.
*  President Richard Nixon had also signed the Clean Air Act
*  and pledged to end the Vietnam War.
*  Congress was working on all sorts of other groundbreaking bills, too.
*  Initiatives to improve standards in industries from energy to agriculture
*  to nursing homes to consumer products.
*  They extended the Voting Rights Act for another five years.
*  This whirlwind of legislation marked an era driven by the notion
*  that government could fix the nation's greatest problems
*  and be a partner in protecting consumers.
*  Compared to today, the United States in 1971 seems like another planet
*  in another galaxy, in a whole other universe.
*  It would be an understatement to say that things were going well for the reformers.
*  But there was still one problem that hadn't been fixed, maybe the biggest one of all.
*  The problem of money.
*  Dirty, sweaty, corrupting money.
*  Though the big successes of the New Deal, the Civil Rights Movement,
*  and the Great Society Eras had overcome some of that corruption,
*  big money was still everywhere in politics
*  and had the potential to jam up all of this amazing progress.
*  In the mid-20th century, corruption scandals periodically rocked Washington,
*  and one scandal even resulted in the resignation of a Supreme Court justice.
*  So the public was becoming more and more aware of the problem.
*  What Americans might not have known is that by the early 1970s,
*  one of the biggest corruption problems of all
*  was right there in the Oval Office, secretly recording everything.
*  These are organized. They're edible. They're militant.
*  This is from President Richard Nixon's newly installed recording system.
*  The audio is a bit muffled, but what you're hearing is the southern twangy voice
*  of John Connolly in the Oval Office telling Nixon that the dairy producers of America
*  are, quote, organized, adamant, and militant.
*  Connolly was a Democrat and the former governor of Texas who survived multiple gunshot wounds
*  when he was sitting in the car as John F. Kennedy was assassinated.
*  Connolly has recovered, and now here in 1971, he's the Treasury Secretary
*  for Kennedy's arch-nemesis, Nixon.
*  This secret recording took place long before Watergate.
*  Nixon is only halfway through his first term as president,
*  but he's already brainstorming with Connolly about ways to raise campaign cash for his re-election.
*  Connolly has a big idea. Milk.
*  Connolly said the milk lobbyists are, quote, amassing an enormous amount of money
*  that they're going to put into political activities.
*  Historically, the milk lobby had used cash to curry favor with Democrats
*  in dairy-producing states and LBJ's administration.
*  But Connolly is telling Nixon and his aides that the milk magnates might be willing to switch sides.
*  He's basically saying if Nixon uses the powers of the presidency to boost the minimum price of milk,
*  it'll enrich the powerful dairy companies, which will encourage them to then spend big to boost Nixon's re-election bid.
*  At the end of the meeting, nothing seems to have been decided,
*  but Connolly asks for a moment alone with Nixon.
*  The tape goes silent.
*  A few minutes later, the recording restarts with Nixon talking to his aides.
*  Nixon is telling his aides that he's green-lighting Connolly's plan,
*  and Connolly is going to collect the milk lobby's money for Nixon's campaign.
*  If it seems like they're speaking in code, maybe they were.
*  Just weeks before, Nixon's agriculture department had declined to provide higher price supports for the dairy industry.
*  But now, the president has decided to personally intervene on the milk magnates' behalf,
*  unilaterally ordering the government to cover 85% of the dairy companies' costs.
*  Nixon was going all out on milk.
*  And Nixon says that in exchange for that big favor,
*  Connolly is going to squeeze the dairy companies for even more cash
*  than what they were already funneling to Nixon's political machine.
*  Did you hear that? Listen to it again.
*  Yes, he's literally talking about, quote, shaking them down.
*  Oh yeah. But it gets better when Nixon's chief of staff, H.R. Haldeman, then responds.
*  To clarify, Haldeman said, quote, that's part of what we had to get set up.
*  These committees set up.
*  He's referring to scores of dummy committees with cartoonishly bullshit names
*  like the kind you now see at the end of election campaign commercials.
*  Meaningless names like the League of Dedicated Voters, the Committee for a Better Nation,
*  and Americans Working for a Better Nation.
*  The League of Dedicated Voters, the Committee for a Better Nation,
*  and Americans Working to Build a Better Community.
*  And why did the Nixon White House need these committees?
*  To hide the fact that the dairy giants were pumping a whopping $90,000 a month
*  into Nixon's campaign machine in exchange for those milk price supports.
*  Nixon was taking the TV ads for milk at the time literally,
*  milking the donors for as much as he could get.
*  How good things go with milk.
*  Hamburgers and hot dogs and spaghetti and meatballs.
*  And apparently money.
*  Dirty, sweaty, corrupting campaign money also goes well with milk.
*  But Nixon was about to regret taking such a big gulp.
*  Joining me for this next part is Master Plan editor Ron Doyle.
*  Hey David.
*  Okay Ron, why is this important in the story of corruption in America?
*  That's a great question.
*  And honestly I was pretty skeptical when you and the producers told me
*  that you wanted our first episode to be about milk prices.
*  Especially since the dairy debacle wasn't even Nixon's first scandal.
*  That's right.
*  But as you mentioned before, 1971 was a pivotal year for American progress.
*  So at the same time that Nixon was secretly trading dairy price supports for campaign cash,
*  Congress was also debating the most serious anti-corruption legislation
*  since the Federal Corrupt Practices Act of 1925.
*  So lawmakers at the time could point to this dirty dairy deal
*  as more proof of why America needed campaign finance reform.
*  Exactly. And I also think it showed average Americans why they should care.
*  The scandal transformed an abstract concept like campaign finance reform
*  into a real world problem.
*  Nixon was so desperate for campaign money that he jacked up the minimum price of milk to get it.
*  That thrust the story into the national spotlight.
*  The Wall Street Journal blared a front page headline.
*  Milk and money. Flood of campaign cash to help Nixon campaign follows hike in dairy supports.
*  The Washington Post just called it milking dollars for Nixon.
*  Even America's favorite newsman Walter Cronkite weighed in.
*  Early last March, Agriculture Secretary Harden announced that federal milk support prices for 1971
*  would remain at current levels.
*  About two weeks later, big dairy firms went to the White House to protest to President Nixon
*  and within two days, Harden did an about face, saying that research had shown a need for higher supports.
*  Subsequently, dairy interests have raised thousands of dollars in campaign funds for Mr. Nixon
*  with the money already flowing to newly created organizations in Washington.
*  But the campaign finance legislation moving through Congress wasn't just about spilled milk.
*  It was also an attempt to address the soaring cost of campaigns in the TV era.
*  With so many Americans glued to their televisions, politicians who wanted to communicate with voters
*  needed to raise more and more money to run television ads, like this one, which might be my favorite from the time period.
*  One, two, three.
*  Okay, so this commercial starts out with a cute little girl plucking petals from a tazy.
*  And then it ends with a nuclear blast and a giant mushroom cloud.
*  These are the stakes.
*  Man, that is so dark.
*  That was an infamous ad that Lyndon Johnson's campaign ran in 1964 when Johnson was up against Senator Barry Goldwater.
*  And ads like that were tremendously expensive and exploding the cost of running campaigns.
*  And those costs were starting to dominate the political conversation.
*  Even Nixon agreed that something needed to change when he was pressed by ABC News in this interview.
*  To me, the greatest danger to our democracy is soaring election costs.
*  What is your view about those election costs?
*  I recall when I ran for the House of Representatives, the campaign cost $25,000. That was in 1946.
*  Right now, I don't think you can run a House campaign for less than $100,000 in any district,
*  except perhaps a rather safe district for an incumbent.
*  So the problem is not the control of the cost. The problem is how.
*  When we found this tape, I was sort of shocked.
*  It was wild to hear Richard Nixon admitting that money in politics was a problem.
*  Yeah, I never expected to hear him say this.
*  We do favor a limitation on expenses. There's no question about that.
*  Wow. So he was going on record saying the White House supported the campaign finance reforms.
*  Well, yeah, but that's not the whole story.
*  Yeah, while the president was claiming to support reforms in front of a TV camera,
*  behind the scenes, Nixon officials were quietly working to kill off the legislation.
*  And we're not making assumptions here.
*  One of our producers went digging around in the National Archives and found shockingly frank evidence of their duplicity.
*  Check this out. Here's a memo entitled, quote,
*  Election Reform from White House counsel John Dean to Chuck Colson.
*  I should explain who Chuck Colson is. Colson was a Rasputin-like White House aide and a Watergate conspirator.
*  Nixon's chief of staff called him the president's hitman.
*  And John Dean was Nixon's lawyer at the White House.
*  In this memo from May 1971, Dean tells Colson to, quote,
*  Wow.
*  Well, it gets worse. Dean goes on to say these groups could quietly go to the Hill
*  and tell members of the House and Senate that if they continue to support this legislation,
*  they will be cutting off financial support from these groups.
*  So in short, the Nixon administration's lawyer told Nixon's top henchmen to organize business groups
*  to threaten lawmakers with financial punishment if they back this legislation designed to fight corruption.
*  Yeah. I mean, really, that kind of vindictive behavior was pretty on brand for the Nixon White House.
*  But the power play didn't work. Lawmakers truly felt the need to do something,
*  and they ultimately passed campaign finance reform legislation.
*  It was known as the Federal Election Campaign Act, or FECA.
*  FECA?
*  Yeah, man, I know what it sounds like. Grow up, dude.
*  Anyway, the bill passed the House with a landslide of support, 334 yeas and only 20 nays.
*  The House of Representatives today passed and sent to the president the first major reform legislation
*  on campaign spending in 50 years.
*  It would set limits on campaign advertising on radio, television and other media,
*  and it would require extensive reports on campaign expenditures.
*  Nixon's henchmen had failed to sabotage the bill.
*  Publicly, Nixon probably loathed every aspect of this legislation.
*  He was compelled to sign it into law on February 7th.
*  President Nixon signed into law today the most extensive reform in federal election spending in half a century.
*  Mr. Nixon said he is confident that it will guard against campaign abuses
*  and help build public confidence in the election process.
*  Before this new law was enacted, the world of campaign finance was a no-holds-barred wild west shit show.
*  The previous laws have been described as, quote, more loophole than law,
*  and politicians faced no accountability.
*  They could pretty much get away with trading favors for campaign cash all in secret.
*  The new bill, FICA, held out hope that the era of dirty money was coming to an end.
*  So that's it. That's the whole podcast, folks.
*  America capped off its golden era of reform legislation by finally giving itself a civilized campaign finance system in 1971,
*  and the rest is history.
*  We have clean elections, tough enforcement of anti-corruption laws,
*  a government that routinely passes legislation that helps millions of people rather than big corporate donors,
*  and we all lived happily ever after here in the utopia of Aaron Sorkin's The West Wing.
*  The end!
*  Great work, everybody. That's a wrap. Awesome podcast, man.
*  Hang on, hang on. My phone is ringing. Hello?
*  Wait, wait, what? Oh. Okay. Right, right. My bad.
*  We don't have any of those things today. In fact, we have the opposite.
*  Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito took an undisclosed fishing trip to Alaska with billionaire donors,
*  including hedge fund manager Paul Singer, who later had business before the court.
*  Menendez accused of accepting bribes of cash and those gold bars to use his political influence for businessmen.
*  Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is acknowledging he took trips on a private plane owned by a Republican donor last year.
*  They really do seem to want to get rid of the criminalization of corruption and bribery.
*  This dystopia is our reality now.
*  Everywhere you turn, there's a breathtaking amount of corruption happening right out there in plain sight.
*  How did this happen? How did we go backwards?
*  Over the next several episodes, you're going to find out.
*  Spoiler, it wasn't an accident.
*  There's been a decades long master plan in the works to legalize political corruption and make America into the kind of place that works only for the rich, the connected and the powerful.
*  This story starts in the 1970s, but it continues today in everything from legislation to court rulings,
*  to Republicans newest policy agenda dropped right into the middle of the 2024 presidential campaign.
*  The conservative Heritage Foundation leading this draconian and at times extreme policy plan project 2025,
*  which has all been written out a 900 page sort of wish list or proposal for the second term.
*  In this series, you're going to learn about the man and the manifesto that set the master plan in motion.
*  Congratulations, Lewis, you have just been elected the board of directors of Philip Morris, Inc.
*  You'll hear about Supreme Court cases that chipped away at democracy and opened the floodgates of money.
*  Money is speech. Speech is protected.
*  And you'll learn how all of this created the hellscape that we live in today.
*  It can't be for a political favor. It can't be. I'll do this official act for you if you vote a certain way.
*  That doesn't fly. It's got to be money.
*  Our next stop on this journey is right after Richard Nixon reluctantly signed that early campaign finance bill.
*  Plans to undermine that law and plans for the Watergate break in are now underway, but the public doesn't know it yet.
*  In fact, Nixon's top aide is on television telling everyone that a brand new era of clean government has begun.
*  And I think after the history of this first term is written and you look back,
*  you're going to see that compared to other administrations or by any standard you'd want to apply,
*  that it has been an extraordinarily clean, corruption free administration because the president insists on it.
*  That's next time on Master Plan.
