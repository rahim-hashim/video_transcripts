# Episode 4: The Secret Task Force | Master Plan
**The Master Plan:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw)
*  Let's imagine for a minute it's January 1973. You're in your car driving home [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=0.0s)]
*  after a long day. Let's say it's a wood paneled Buick. You're stressed about [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=6.3s)]
*  work. You're scanning through radio stations but all of the news coming out [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  of Washington is bad. Nixon, days away from his second inauguration, is trying [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=17.1s)]
*  everything he can to distance himself from a growing scandal. Senate Democrats [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=22.0s)]
*  have chosen North Carolina's Sam Irvin to investigate the Watergate bugging [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=27.0s)]
*  case. The committee would have full subpoena power and a half million dollar [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  budget. There are new protests every day. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=35.34s)]
*  It's exhausting. So you flip the radio over to the AM dial. You find WARM 590, a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=42.28s)]
*  station that serves northern Pennsylvania and parts of New York. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Businessman, have you read the Powell memorandum? You're thinking the [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=54.08s)]
*  Powell memorandum? What the hell is that? It just might be the most important [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=59.04s)]
*  single document regarding the free enterprise system ever written. And who [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=63.92s)]
*  is this guy they're talking about? Lewis Powell. The same Lewis F. Powell, who is now a [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=67.52s)]
*  member justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, prepared an in-depth [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=71.98s)]
*  study entitled Attack on American Free Enterprise System. Okay, so this is a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=76.44s)]
*  recreation, but we based it on the actual word-for-word transcripts of a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=81.88s)]
*  series of radio editorials that WARM 590 presented on the topic of a growing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=87.28s)]
*  menace in this country which threatens to choke to death our system of free [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=94.56s)]
*  enterprise. You rev the Buick engine and squeeze the steering wheel. The speaker [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=100.16s)]
*  describes how this new threat is not from your typical commies and radicals. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=105.74s)]
*  No, no, no. This new enemy is even more dangerous. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  People in college classrooms, people who reach the public through radio and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=114.2s)]
*  television and newspapers and magazines, people in our own community. Their [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  numbers aren't all that big yet, but their weapons are powerful and ability [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=124.32000000000001s)]
*  to talk, to write, and to influence public opinion. They match this with an [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=128.44s)]
*  almost religious devotion to one goal, destroy free enterprise in America. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=133.24s)]
*  You in your Buick are the Mr. Businessman this editorial is talking to. You work [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  hard, you pay your taxes, you think the American system is pretty great. This [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=144.6s)]
*  Powell memo they're talking about is stirring something in you. You realize [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=149.24s)]
*  it's time to get off the sidelines and join the fight. In the last episode, we [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=153.8s)]
*  told you about how Lewis Powell came to write his manifesto, and we ended with [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=159.86s)]
*  the question, did it actually mean anything? Was it just Lewis Powell's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=164.56s)]
*  early version of an angry Reddit thread that went into the ether? Or, as some [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=169.2s)]
*  claim, was it much more? Did oligarchs and activists use it as their step by [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=174.24s)]
*  step blueprint for the takeover of major American institutions? Well, after two [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=180.82s)]
*  years of research and the discovery of some documents that have never seen the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=186.32s)]
*  We finally have the answer. We all know the history of the many social movements [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=191.92s)]
*  in the 60s and 70s. Civil rights, the environment, women's lib. But in this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  episode, we're gonna tell you about the movement you've probably never heard of, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=202.0s)]
*  the Powell memo movement that began the process of legalizing corruption in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=206.11999999999998s)]
*  America. I'm David Sirota, and this is Masterplan. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  When we left off in the previous episode, Lewis Powell's memo had been leaked to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=220.92s)]
*  the media, and it stirred a minor controversy because the FBI did not [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=245.88s)]
*  include it in its report to the senators voting on Powell's Supreme Court [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=250.4s)]
*  nomination. I'm here with our producer Jared Jekang-Mayor. So Jared, fill us in [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=254.96s)]
*  on what happened to Powell after the memo became public. So that was in the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=259.88s)]
*  fall of 1972, and Powell had only been on the Supreme Court for less than a year. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=264.52s)]
*  And in his personal papers, I found letters from business executives and [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=269.12s)]
*  other high-profile friends offering their support, and some of them asking, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=273.92s)]
*  Hey, can I get a copy of this memo? But Powell was always careful about [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=277.72s)]
*  maintaining the appearance of impartiality. He called it part of his, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=282.48s)]
*  quote, sterilization as a judge. And he would always refer inquiries to his buddy, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  Gene Sidner, over at the Chamber of Commerce and say, go get copies from them. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=291.24s)]
*  And as we've said before, Powell never addressed the memo publicly, right? No, he [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=295.8s)]
*  didn't really need to, because the controversy only stayed in the news for a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  couple of weeks and then basically went away. Powell never talked about it, and it [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=305.12s)]
*  doesn't seem like he was ever even asked about the memo for the rest of his life. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=309.44s)]
*  Like it almost never even happened. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=313.44s)]
*  Yeah, and it was frustrating because when I was at the Powell archives digging [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=315.96s)]
*  through his papers, I could see these little snippets, these references where [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=320.28s)]
*  you could tell something more was going on. Meetings, campaigns, things that had [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=325.04s)]
*  been set up around the memo. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=329.96s)]
*  At the Chamber of Commerce? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=331.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I looked there at the public archive for the U.S. Chamber, and it goes [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=332.88s)]
*  back more than 100 years, but I couldn't find much. I had to start looking further [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=336.96s)]
*  afield at other archives and libraries around the country, just connecting the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=341.64s)]
*  dots between people who might have been involved at the time. And eventually I [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=346.36s)]
*  came up with a pretty clear picture of what transpired in the years after the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=351.28s)]
*  Powell memo was leaked. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=355.28s)]
*  You mean the vast shadowy conspiracy? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=356.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, it does involve the names of powerful people that you would probably [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=359.32s)]
*  recognize. To be fair, some of these figures were already part of the [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=363.67999999999995s)]
*  conservative movement that was emerging in the 1970s, but it does seem like the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=367.2s)]
*  memo came at the exact right moment in time to steer many of these folks in the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=372.32s)]
*  same direction. The business roundtable, the head of Procter & Gamble, Charles [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=377.67999999999995s)]
*  Koch, Roger Ailes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=382.55999999999995s)]
*  Dude, dude, dude, are you about to say Pepe Silvia? Because this kind of feels [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=384.28s)]
*  like it's that scene in It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia where Charlie [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=387.76s)]
*  covered the office walls with those sheets of paper connected with red lines. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=391.64s)]
*  Pepe Silvia, this name keeps coming up over and over again. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  Every day Pepe's mail is getting sent back to me. Pepe Silvia, Pepe Silvia. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=398.08s)]
*  I look in the mail, well this whole box is Pepe Silvia! [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=401.12s)]
*  David, have you been spying on me in my basement? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=403.64s)]
*  OK, but you're right. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=407.2s)]
*  This is all very expansive and interconnected and a lot of names keep [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=409.12s)]
*  showing up. So for the purpose of this episode, I want to hone in on three [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=414.28s)]
*  previously unknown gatherings that were specifically focused on the Powell memo. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  We're going to go from Florida to Dallas and then to D.C. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=424.2s)]
*  OK, so let's start in a place where everything seems to break bad. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=427.56s)]
*  Florida. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=433.23999999999995s)]
*  Walt Disney World is more than just a place. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=434.64s)]
*  It is a complete vacation destination where guests may stay as long as they like. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=438.0s)]
*  At the Polynesian village, there is a leisurely atmosphere of the South Sea [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=443.2s)]
*  and trade winds. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=447.76s)]
*  Orlando, March 1973, the U.S. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=449.0s)]
*  Chamber of Commerce's Public Affairs Committee organized a three day [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=452.44s)]
*  conference at Disney World's Polynesian Hotel, and it was the first big meeting [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=455.84s)]
*  of a group called the Task Force on the Powell Memorandum. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=461.03999999999996s)]
*  Come on, man, there was actually a Powell memo task force and they met at the [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=464.71999999999997s)]
*  Polynesian resort in Disney World like for real, for real, for real, for real. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=470.68s)]
*  The great ceremonial house dominates the scene in a setting that is lushly tropical. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=476.32s)]
*  And for each guest, there is a feeling of coming to a tiny island in the South [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=481.36s)]
*  Pacific to stay and play. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm imagining newly planted palm trees and white sand beaches. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=487.08s)]
*  The tiki torches are burning. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=491.12s)]
*  The Cinderella Castle is off in the distance. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  The super futuristic monorail is gliding along an elevated track. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=495.96000000000004s)]
*  And in the middle of all this magic and joy, you're telling me there are a bunch [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  of stuffy white dudes in wide lapel 70s suits wandering around the lobby of this [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=505.72s)]
*  new hotel? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=512.0s)]
*  And imagine that everyone is clutching their copies of the Powell Memorandum. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=512.88s)]
*  So how did this happen? [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=516.88s)]
*  Well, the main coordinator behind this gathering was a guy named William G. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=518.4s)]
*  White. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=522.6800000000001s)]
*  He was the top lobbyist in Washington for United States Steel, one of the biggest [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=523.64s)]
*  steel producers in the world. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=528.0s)]
*  He was also picked to serve as chairman of this newly created Powell Memo Task Force. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=529.6800000000001s)]
*  We'll talk more about White in a minute. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=535.08s)]
*  But first, I want you to check this out. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=536.76s)]
*  It's a roster of other task force members. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=539.2s)]
*  OK, let's see. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=541.96s)]
*  There's I'm looking here. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=542.6800000000001s)]
*  OK, there's Richard Jenks, president of CBS. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=544.6800000000001s)]
*  There's Jay Van Andel, who co-founded Amway with the notorious Richard DeVos. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=548.4s)]
*  Let's see. There's top brass from Phillips Petroleum. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=553.4s)]
*  I also see a bunch of executives here from JCPenney, 3M, the American Medical [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=556.28s)]
*  Association, General Motors, deans from a couple of universities. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=560.96s)]
*  This is a meeting of the Chamber of Commerce, but not like your local Chamber [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=565.2s)]
*  of Commerce. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=570.0s)]
*  This isn't a gathering of mom and pop shops from Main Street America. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=570.6800000000001s)]
*  This is like the elite of the elite, the masters of the corporate and political [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=575.32s)]
*  world hanging out at Disney World. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=580.36s)]
*  It really is a small world, David. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=582.96s)]
*  And you've got to read this, too. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=588.8000000000001s)]
*  Here's a copy of the actual agenda. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=590.88s)]
*  So it looks like attendees were first greeted at a reception aboard the Eastern [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  Winds, an authentic Chinese junk ship that apparently doubled as a floating [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=598.84s)]
*  cocktail lounge. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=604.24s)]
*  As their spouses and families took in a hula performance or hit the waterslides, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  the corporate guys got down to business in the Micronesian conference room. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  One session was called Interpreting Business, a think tank session on how to, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=615.16s)]
*  quote, enhance the image of business. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=620.68s)]
*  They also exchanged ideas for how to sway public opinion through, quote, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=623.48s)]
*  economic education, which was a big theme of the Powell Memo. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=627.92s)]
*  OK, so then there's a 9 a.m. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=631.8s)]
*  to noon session on political action. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=633.56s)]
*  It was a workshop focused on the Powell Memo's recommendations to increase [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=636.12s)]
*  political effectiveness and, quote, what more the chamber and business [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=640.2s)]
*  community can do to develop more political clout. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=644.48s)]
*  Political clout, another core message of the Powell Memo. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=648.1600000000001s)]
*  And it was the most pressing topic of this meeting. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, let's go back to the organizer of this event, U.S. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=654.6s)]
*  Steel lobbyist William White. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=657.84s)]
*  This wasn't some everyday hack. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=659.9200000000001s)]
*  One observer described him as, quote, the dean of the corporate Washington [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=662.12s)]
*  And White was not just a fixture on K Street. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=667.64s)]
*  He was the ringleader among a new breed of corporate public affairs specialists. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=670.76s)]
*  These were guys that brought together lobbying, legislative know-how, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=675.8399999999999s)]
*  legal pressure and media skills, all in service of growing [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=679.4399999999999s)]
*  a client's political influence. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=682.88s)]
*  And the lobbyists know the truth. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=684.5999999999999s)]
*  The easiest way to pull strings in Washington is to control [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=687.0799999999999s)]
*  politicians with campaign money. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=691.16s)]
*  And here's where it gets really interesting. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=693.28s)]
*  Midway through the conference, White left the Polynesian Hotel [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=695.8000000000001s)]
*  and jumped in his car. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=699.0s)]
*  I bet it was something like a wood paneled Buick. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=700.28s)]
*  And jumped in his proverbial wood paneled Buick and headed to the Orlando [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=703.96s)]
*  airport for an important pickup. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=708.64s)]
*  He wasn't picking up bags of dirty cash like in episode two. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=710.6800000000001s)]
*  White was there to give a lift to his longtime friends, Jerry and Betty. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=714.6s)]
*  Jerry was once an obscure Republican congressman from Michigan. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=720.2s)]
*  But at this point, he was on a glide path to something much bigger. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=724.3199999999999s)]
*  I, Gerald R. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=728.4799999999999s)]
*  Ford, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the office [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=729.52s)]
*  of president of the United States. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=733.8s)]
*  Yes, that Jerry. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=735.8399999999999s)]
*  Gerald Ford, who is still in Congress, but later that year will become [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=737.68s)]
*  vice president and soon after that, president. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=741.88s)]
*  Officially, Congressman Jerry came to Florida to take part in another [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=745.4s)]
*  work-related junket on the invitation of William White, a junket paid [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=749.4s)]
*  for by US Steel, of course. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=753.76s)]
*  But instead of heading to a golf course, Gerald Ford was going to the happiest [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=755.84s)]
*  place on earth to schmooze and collaborate with the Powell Memo Task Force. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=760.52s)]
*  According to the conference schedule, the honorable Gerald R. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=769.72s)]
*  Ford was the official speaker at the luncheon on Friday. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=773.0s)]
*  But there may have been an ulterior motive for his participation in that day's [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=776.84s)]
*  session, strategizing about the upcoming congressional elections and about how to [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=780.92s)]
*  deal with legislation that was problematic for the master plan, the [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=786.36s)]
*  Federal Election Campaign Act. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=790.52s)]
*  FECA. So remember back in episode two, we told you that Ford signed the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=792.8s)]
*  amendments seeming to make FECA even stronger when he became president. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=797.68s)]
*  So this is right before that, when they are discussing those amendments. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=801.88s)]
*  When Ford did sign those amendments, it was seen as a big win for the reformers, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=805.4s)]
*  not the master planners there at Disney World. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=810.52s)]
*  And for the most part, FECA was a win for common cause and the reformers. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=813.4s)]
*  But the master planners were desperate to get around FECA's restrictions on [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=817.92s)]
*  corporate funded political action committees that funnel money to [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=821.8399999999999s)]
*  politicians and political parties. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=825.3199999999999s)]
*  This Powell Memo meeting at Disney World was where they perfected their plan. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=827.48s)]
*  I got a letter for you to read, David. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=831.72s)]
*  This was written by one of the attendees a week before he went to Disney World on [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=833.52s)]
*  behalf of his boss, John Merrill Olin. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=837.96s)]
*  Olin, the wealthy industrialist. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=840.76s)]
*  We'll talk more about him later. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=842.84s)]
*  In this letter, the executive writes about the Powell Memo task force in intimate [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=844.2800000000001s)]
*  detail, especially their lobbying effort to amend the regulations around corporate [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=848.1600000000001s)]
*  campaign donations. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=852.6800000000001s)]
*  He wrote, quote, We should be able to get many companies to follow our own pattern [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=854.48s)]
*  of political fundraising. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=858.84s)]
*  He's talking about political action committees, PACs, and without getting too [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=860.2s)]
*  far into the weeds. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=864.6s)]
*  The corporate guys at this Orlando meeting wanted an exemption to an older law that [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=866.0400000000001s)]
*  was standing in the way of huge multinationals like the Olin Corporation from [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=871.64s)]
*  dumping money into corporate PACs. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=877.28s)]
*  The effort was being opposed by common cause and a senator from Wisconsin named [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=880.08s)]
*  William Proxmire, who was threatening to filibuster. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=885.12s)]
*  Check out this line, quote, I have suggested to some of my corporate associates that we [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=888.28s)]
*  might contribute to a special fund to have Senator Proxmire get a few more hair [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=892.92s)]
*  transplants, provided the operator drills a little deeper this time. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=897.7199999999999s)]
*  OK, so they're like joking about murdering Senator Proxmire basically, or at least [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=901.56s)]
*  lobotomizing him. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=906.04s)]
*  Yeah. And we know that Ford was there. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=906.9599999999999s)]
*  We know that amending FICO was a major item of discussion at the meeting. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=909.7199999999999s)]
*  And we know that the meeting took place right before Ford's keynote speech to the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=913.64s)]
*  Powell Memo task force. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=918.76s)]
*  So let's review. While drinking Mai Tais at Disney World's Polynesian Hotel, the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=920.2s)]
*  master planners are specifically scheming to end restrictions on corporate PACs and [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=925.4000000000001s)]
*  they're schmoozing directly with Gerald Ford, the then House minority leader on his [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=931.6s)]
*  way to becoming president. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=936.84s)]
*  And then guess what? [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=938.2s)]
*  A provision killing those restrictions ended up in the FICO reform bill that Gerald Ford [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=939.48s)]
*  first dealt with in Congress and then later signed into law as president. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  Wow, what a shocking coincidence. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=948.8s)]
*  Remember what Ford said in episode two when he signed the bill into law? [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=952.3599999999999s)]
*  All the compromises that were necessary in the process. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=956.56s)]
*  I guess now we know where some of those compromises came from. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=960.9599999999999s)]
*  So under the guise of post-Watergate campaign finance reform legislation, the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=964.7199999999999s)]
*  master planners from this Powell Memo meeting ended up creating their first [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=970.3199999999999s)]
*  corruption loophole. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=975.56s)]
*  And as soon as that law took effect, there was an immediate explosion in campaign [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=977.24s)]
*  spending by corporate America. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=982.24s)]
*  No more secret bags of dirty cash smuggled through airports, a la Nixon. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  The chamber wanted all of its members to write checks for millions of dollars to [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=989.36s)]
*  totally official, totally legal and extremely powerful business PACs. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=994.3199999999999s)]
*  But back to Disney World, the master planners honed their plan to keep the money [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1000.16s)]
*  flowing into politics. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1005.04s)]
*  But what else did they decide? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1006.8399999999999s)]
*  Well, the vision laid out in the Powell Memo was so multifaceted and expansive [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1008.4399999999999s)]
*  that they realized that executing it would be really hard. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1014.12s)]
*  It needed to be more sophisticated and broad based than any effort previously [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1017.64s)]
*  undertaken by the business community. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1021.9599999999999s)]
*  It probably seemed super daunting. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1023.68s)]
*  Yeah, well, if you're going to wish upon a star, you know, this is a place to do it. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1026.32s)]
*  But either way, they got down to work. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1030.52s)]
*  The documents we unearthed show that the task force members, there were about 50 [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1032.72s)]
*  of them, were divided up into subcommittees for each of the core tenants of the [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  Powell Memo. You had communications, education, political action, and judicial [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1041.3600000000001s)]
*  action. They were instructed to spend the next several months intensively analyzing [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1047.0800000000002s)]
*  and considering Powell's words. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  They were told to, quote, to reach beyond, to blue sky their thinking and not to [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1054.52s)]
*  limit themselves just to the Powell Memo as they develop their ideas for the [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1060.16s)]
*  chamber. Remember that key line in the Powell Memo? [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1064.28s)]
*  Strength lies in organization, in careful long range planning and implementation, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1067.4s)]
*  inconsistency of action over an indefinite period of years, in the scale of [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1073.3200000000002s)]
*  financing available only through joint effort. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1079.0400000000002s)]
*  In other words, to borrow a phrase from the civil rights movements of the previous [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1082.3200000000002s)]
*  decade, they needed to do some coalition building and spread the gospel. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1086.8s)]
*  The mid 20th century was fertile ground for political manifestos. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1093.6s)]
*  It seemed like you couldn't walk 10 feet without tripping over some pivotal work [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1098.08s)]
*  inspiring a new social and political movement. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1103.08s)]
*  There was the Feminine Mystique by Betty Friedan for the feminist movement, Rachel [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1106.2s)]
*  Carson's Silent Spring for the environmental movement. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1110.68s)]
*  There was Saul Alinsky's Rules for Radicals. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1113.8s)]
*  There was Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Letter from Birmingham Jail, which became a [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1116.72s)]
*  galvanizing text for the civil rights movement. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1121.08s)]
*  And don't forget the granddaddy of them all, The Little Red Book by Mao Zedong. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1124.04s)]
*  They always carry Chairman Mao's works with them and study them everywhere and [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  anytime. But this was the challenge for corporate conservatives in this era. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1133.0s)]
*  They didn't have anything like The Little Red Book. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1138.1599999999999s)]
*  And this was a problem for them. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1141.6799999999998s)]
*  Although I do like the idea of the conservative mystique. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1143.48s)]
*  Well, they did have books like Barry Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1147.1200000000001s)]
*  and they did have figures like William F. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1151.6000000000001s)]
*  Buckley on TV and radio. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1153.4s)]
*  But if they were going to create a movement to counter the left, they needed something [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1155.64s)]
*  that would not only inspire the insiders and power brokers and elites, but also [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1160.2s)]
*  something that would motivate the masses. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1165.48s)]
*  And this is why I'm skeptical about whether the Powell memo was leaked to The [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1167.8s)]
*  Washington Post without the knowledge of the top leadership at the Chamber of [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1171.6399999999999s)]
*  Commerce, because right after the memo went public in 1972, you see that the [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1175.32s)]
*  chamber is immediately publishing it and distributing it far and wide. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1180.12s)]
*  They mailed thousands of copies to members. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1184.08s)]
*  They printed it in their official magazine with an elaborate design treatment, like [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1186.36s)]
*  it was some mysterious quasi-religious text that must be read. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  It really was kind of like the conservative movement's version of the Anarchists [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1194.32s)]
*  Cookbook. It was kind of like contraband, a publication that everyone had heard [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1198.8s)]
*  about but wasn't on the newsstand. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1203.32s)]
*  And even though the Powell memo was never an officially published book, according [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1205.76s)]
*  to the Chamber's estimates, hundreds of thousands of copies of it were circulated, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1210.36s)]
*  reaching millions of Americans and sparking numerous discussions and speeches and [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1214.9199999999998s)]
*  articles. It was an underground bestseller. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1219.12s)]
*  And by early 1973, activity around the memo was intense. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1221.84s)]
*  So intense, in fact, that at the same time Gerald Ford was at Disney World [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1226.84s)]
*  delivering his keynote address to the Powell Memo Conference, it turns out there [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1231.68s)]
*  was another event, a rival event, about the Powell memo that was happening at the [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1236.04s)]
*  Marriott Hotel in Dallas, Texas. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1240.84s)]
*  At the same time? [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1243.52s)]
*  The same exact day, March 30th, 1973. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1244.96s)]
*  I want to show you this. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1249.76s)]
*  These are notes taken by a man named John A. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1251.72s)]
*  Howard. Howard came from the world of academia and he was the president of [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1254.6s)]
*  Rockford College in Illinois. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1258.84s)]
*  He was an influential figure in the emerging conservative movement at the time. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1261.08s)]
*  This Dallas meeting looks like it was organized by members of something called [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1264.76s)]
*  the YPO. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1269.32s)]
*  The Young Presidents Organization. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1270.9599999999998s)]
*  It was a social club for executives and owners of smaller businesses. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1272.9199999999998s)]
*  And it's still around today. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1277.0s)]
*  In early 1973, the YPO orchestrated a series of gatherings, Powell memo parties, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1278.48s)]
*  if you will, for members who wanted to fight the fight. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1284.04s)]
*  Sounds like a hippie love-in for angry middle managers. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1287.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, pretty much. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1291.56s)]
*  And Howard was one of the attendees at the Dallas meeting and he saw the Powell [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1292.28s)]
*  memo as a way to build a new ideologically driven movement. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1296.8799999999999s)]
*  At the YPO meeting, there was a focus on the part of the Powell memo that talked [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1301.32s)]
*  about the seeming paradox of how. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1305.44s)]
*  Most of the media, including the national TV systems, are owned and theoretically [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1307.8s)]
*  controlled by corporations which depend upon profits and the enterprise [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1312.96s)]
*  system to survive. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1317.92s)]
*  So at this Dallas meeting, the assembled businessmen start asking, why couldn't [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1319.68s)]
*  corporations leverage their power as advertisers to shape the news coverage [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1324.68s)]
*  from media outlets they sponsor? [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1329.96s)]
*  And on this topic, Howard was impressed by a young TV producer who had helped [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1332.1200000000001s)]
*  Richard Nixon get elected. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1336.96s)]
*  He noted, quote, this man appears to be a potential secret weapon and the chamber [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1338.6000000000001s)]
*  would be wise to enlist him as a consultant. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1343.44s)]
*  And that young man's name was. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1346.52s)]
*  Hang on, don't say the name yet. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  Can we get some more ominous music here? [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1350.2s)]
*  Okay, there we go. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1352.88s)]
*  Okay, go ahead. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1353.8000000000002s)]
*  That young man's name was Roger Ailes. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1354.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't believe anyone will ever be elected to a major public office again, without [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1357.2s)]
*  the skillful use of television. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1362.4s)]
*  Roger Ailes. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1363.96s)]
*  Roger Ailes. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1364.92s)]
*  Roger Ailes. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1365.76s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1366.68s)]
*  Like the Roger Ailes? [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1367.56s)]
*  Yep. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1369.6s)]
*  Roger Ailes, the founder and former CEO of Fox News. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1370.0s)]
*  Here's what John Howard wrote about Ailes presentation. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1378.08s)]
*  And David, you should read this part. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1381.3999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1383.36s)]
*  Let me take a look. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1383.56s)]
*  Quote, Roger Ailes outlined the power which advertisers would be able to exert [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1384.6799999999998s)]
*  upon TV programming if they were moved to do so. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1390.84s)]
*  The chamber members not only need to understand the problem, but be informed [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1394.96s)]
*  about where and how they can apply leverage and be given the tools to [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1399.68s)]
*  exert the leverage. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1404.6000000000001s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1406.5600000000002s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1407.1200000000001s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1407.64s)]
*  In my time working in politics and media, I have been eye rolled and depicted as [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1408.76s)]
*  some sort of deranged conspiracy theorist. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1414.28s)]
*  Whenever I've suggested that corporate advertisers at times try to and have the [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1417.52s)]
*  power to influence the news with their advertising dollars. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1422.28s)]
*  But here at this meeting, it looks like the future founder of Fox News spelled [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1426.32s)]
*  that out as an explicit political strategy. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1432.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1435.48s)]
*  And John Howard loved this idea. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1435.84s)]
*  At the time, Ailes was an up and coming TV producer turned political consultant. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1439.04s)]
*  His ideas about shaping public perceptions through media, it found a receptive [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1443.92s)]
*  audience at this Dallas meeting, as well as other meetings that he attended about [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1447.96s)]
*  the Powell memo. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1451.72s)]
*  Dear listener, if you've ever looked at the Republican Party of today and [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1452.72s)]
*  wondered how did country club Republicans and the grand old party of Abraham [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1457.28s)]
*  Lincoln wind up in bed with hard right libertarians and how did Fox News become [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1462.1200000000001s)]
*  the obnoxious bullhorn of the conservative movement? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1468.32s)]
*  This is the moment when those coalitions started to form. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1471.68s)]
*  The Powell memo served as the connective tissue. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1475.8s)]
*  And to be clear, the hard right libertarian faction was different from the [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1479.04s)]
*  chamber of commerce crowd at Disney World. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1483.4s)]
*  The libertarians had previously felt marginalized in the Republican Party. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1485.52s)]
*  While the pro business Republicans at Disney World wanted favors from the [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1489.96s)]
*  government, the libertarians were anti-government ideologues who wanted [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1493.92s)]
*  to tear it all down. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1498.64s)]
*  We're talking about direct descendants of the robber barons of the Gilded Age, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1499.88s)]
*  who are committed to the destruction of the federal government bureaucracy that [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1503.8s)]
*  was expanded under the New Deal. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1507.52s)]
*  But in 1973 and 1974, you had these convergences, some bigger and more formal, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1509.16s)]
*  some smaller and more intimate, where the Powell memo served as a unifying [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1515.8s)]
*  document. Its promise of freedom and enterprise went viral among both groups [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1520.56s)]
*  and brought them together. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1525.8799999999999s)]
*  So how did something go viral before the Internet? [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1527.44s)]
*  It's not like this was at the airport bookstore. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1530.6399999999999s)]
*  No, it wasn't something you could get at the newsstand. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1533.2s)]
*  The Chamber of Commerce sent the memo to its members directly, and then it spread [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1536.16s)]
*  organically from person to person, probably using snail mail and lots of [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1540.2s)]
*  Xerox copies. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1545.12s)]
*  Imagine some vice president of a company opens up his mailbox and finds a copy of [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1546.2s)]
*  the memo. He loves it so much that he makes a copy. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1551.2s)]
*  Then the memo arrives at the mansion of wealthy industrialist John Olin, who [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1557.28s)]
*  inherited his fortune from his family's chemical ammunitions empire in the 1930s. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1562.16s)]
*  So Olin is like, oh, my God, this guy, Lewis Powell, this guy is saying [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1566.76s)]
*  everything that I've been thinking. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1571.3600000000001s)]
*  Olin would go on to dump hundreds of millions of dollars into conservative [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1573.2s)]
*  think tanks, media organizations, and become a main backer of a conservative [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1576.72s)]
*  legal group called the Federalist Society. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1581.3600000000001s)]
*  We'll talk about the Federalist Society in depth later in this series. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1584.1200000000001s)]
*  Then the Powell memo shows up in Wichita, Kansas, at the estate of Charles and [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1588.08s)]
*  David Koch. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1595.32s)]
*  The Koch brothers. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1596.16s)]
*  I don't even think we need to explain the impact of the Kochs, but the Koch brothers [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1597.32s)]
*  are recognized as some of the biggest financiers of conservative politics. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1601.28s)]
*  Their father built an empire in oil and gas, and they inherited his business, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1605.72s)]
*  along with his hardcore libertarian ideology. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1610.16s)]
*  And Charles, we know, found inspiration in the Powell memo. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1613.56s)]
*  In 1974, he read an excerpt of the Powell memo to a group of like-minded [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1617.0400000000002s)]
*  conservatives and said he didn't think it went far enough, actually. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1621.3600000000001s)]
*  So he co-founded the Cato Institute, another think tank dedicated to stuff like [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1625.5200000000002s)]
*  deregulating campaign finance. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1630.2800000000002s)]
*  These guys really took to heart Powell's urging to play the long game, to invest [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1632.1200000000001s)]
*  money in creating alternative institutions to shift the country in a whole new [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1638.3200000000002s)]
*  direction at every level. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1644.1200000000001s)]
*  Another copy gets made. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1645.96s)]
*  Now imagine the memo arriving at the estate of Richard Mellon Scaife, the mogul [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1649.16s)]
*  who inherited his family's oil and banking fortune. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1653.92s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1656.6000000000001s)]
*  Scaife's name came up in episode two. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1657.48s)]
*  He was one of Nixon's secret donors who got exposed by that common cause [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1660.16s)]
*  lawsuit. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1664.28s)]
*  $800,000 from Richard Scaife of the wealthy Mellon family. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1664.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1668.44s)]
*  And after reading the Powell memo, Scaife began a decades-long mission to funnel [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1668.8000000000002s)]
*  hundreds of millions of dollars into conservative causes and organizations. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1673.76s)]
*  That includes the Heritage Foundation. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1677.8s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1679.84s)]
*  And this brings us to our last figure. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1680.72s)]
*  A copy of the memo arrives in Golden, Colorado, at the headquarters of Coors [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1684.48s)]
*  Brewing Company. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1689.48s)]
*  Joseph Coors, a grandson of the company's founder, told a historian that the Powell [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1690.8799999999999s)]
*  memorandum stirred him and made him realize American business was, quote, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1695.92s)]
*  ignoring a crisis. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1700.5600000000002s)]
*  So he tapped his family's brewing fortune for a venture led by Roger Ailes, which [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1702.6000000000001s)]
*  laid the groundwork for what would evolve into Fox News. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1707.96s)]
*  But his biggest investments were put toward making radical changes to the [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1712.16s)]
*  intellectual and policy landscape of Washington, D.C. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1716.16s)]
*  He became one of the first and biggest funders of the Heritage Foundation, which [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1720.1200000000001s)]
*  was founded in February 1973. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1724.0800000000002s)]
*  For listeners who vaguely recognize the name of the Heritage Foundation, it's [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1726.72s)]
*  probably because the organization and its policy agenda have been touted by [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1731.5600000000002s)]
*  Republican presidents for the last four decades. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1736.16s)]
*  You don't have to trust me on that. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1739.5600000000002s)]
*  The 2024 Republican vice presidential nominee, J.D. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1741.24s)]
*  Vance, explicitly said that, writing, quote, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1744.96s)]
*  And Vance wasn't exaggerating when he wrote that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1756.64s)]
*  Here's Ronald Reagan in the 1980s. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1761.64s)]
*  I mentioned the things that were on the minds of conservatives at the moment, the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1764.0800000000002s)]
*  importance of the Heritage Foundation, the remarkable work of Joe and Holly Coors, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1767.8000000000002s)]
*  and so many of you in this room in bringing to Washington the political [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1773.5600000000002s)]
*  revolution. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1777.0400000000002s)]
*  And here's what you've been hearing in the news about Donald Trump. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1777.88s)]
*  The conservative Heritage Foundation leading this election, the Republican [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1781.1200000000001s)]
*  Heritage Foundation leading this draconian and at times extreme policy [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1785.1200000000001s)]
*  plan, Project 2025, a 900 page sort of wish list or proposal for the second [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1790.4s)]
*  term. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1796.4s)]
*  Heritage does such an incredible job and they're going to lay the groundwork and [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1797.16s)]
*  detail plans for exactly what our movement will do. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1801.8s)]
*  So there it is, another direct line from Lewis Powell's manifesto to the present [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1805.28s)]
*  era. In this case, from the Powell memo in 1971, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1810.92s)]
*  to Project 2025 today, the Powell memo inspires oligarchs to fund the Heritage [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1815.1200000000001s)]
*  Foundation and the Heritage Foundation then became the author of the agenda of [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1820.92s)]
*  the entire conservative movement all the way into this current moment that we're [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1825.56s)]
*  now living through. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1830.08s)]
*  But back here in 1973, this was all still underground, just a bunch of ideologues, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1831.08s)]
*  eggheads, activists and oligarchs cross pollinating with one another. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1837.24s)]
*  So the question for the master planners at this early moment in the 1970s was, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1841.12s)]
*  how do they take the Powell memo's ideas and start implementing them? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1846.84s)]
*  How do they begin infiltrating the courts and infiltrating American culture? [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1851.76s)]
*  That's where we're going next. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1858.0s)]
*  Let me set the scene. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1860.6399999999999s)]
*  It's November 12th, 1974, 19 months after the meeting at Disney World with Gerald [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1862.08s)]
*  Ford and the meeting in Dallas with Roger Ailes. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1868.24s)]
*  The last leaves are dropping off the trees and Richard, I'm not a crook, Nixon [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1871.52s)]
*  is gone. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1876.08s)]
*  I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1877.08s)]
*  Congressman Jerry from the Disney World meeting is now President Gerald Ford, and [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1880.4s)]
*  he's given Nixon a get out of jail free card. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1885.56s)]
*  A full, free and absolute pardon unto Richard Nixon for all offenses against the [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1888.24s)]
*  United States. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1895.48s)]
*  At this point in 1974, Lewis Powell has settled into his job on the Supreme Court, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1896.48s)]
*  developing a reputation as a reasonable moderate, and the general public has [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1902.04s)]
*  forgotten about the leak of his memo. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1906.56s)]
*  The Powell memo task force, however, has been busy implementing the recommendations [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1909.24s)]
*  of the memo. And here at this meeting in 1974, there was likely a deep sense of [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1914.52s)]
*  urgency. Just days before the gathering, the master planners, Republican allies and [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1920.56s)]
*  Congress saw historic midterm losses in the post Watergate election, sweeping in [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1926.16s)]
*  a new wave of liberal reformers. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1932.0400000000002s)]
*  Earlier, I said I wanted to talk about three important meetings, and this is the [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1934.44s)]
*  third and final one. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1938.76s)]
*  It doesn't have tiki torches and Mai ties. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1940.24s)]
*  This gathering is being held at the Chamber of Commerce's headquarters in [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1942.5600000000002s)]
*  Washington, D.C., located right near the White House. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1946.2s)]
*  And I found the actual seating chart. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1949.8000000000002s)]
*  Check out the names around this table. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1952.44s)]
*  Let's take a look here. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1954.5600000000002s)]
*  OK, there's William Baruti, president of the conservative think tank, the American [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1955.76s)]
*  Enterprise Institute. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1960.2s)]
*  And he's sitting next to Barton Cummings, the bowtie wearing head of one of the [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1961.24s)]
*  nation's biggest advertising agencies and chair of the ad council. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1965.88s)]
*  I see Gene Sidner, the Richmond, Virginia businessman who first got Lewis Powell to [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1970.0s)]
*  draft his infamous memo to the Chamber of Commerce. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1974.6000000000001s)]
*  And two seats away from him is John Howard, the president of Rockford College, who [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1977.3200000000002s)]
*  attended the Dallas meeting. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1981.76s)]
*  Of course, there's a representative from Jay Van Andel, who co-founded Amway with [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1983.4399999999998s)]
*  Richard DeVos. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1988.6399999999999s)]
*  And all around the table, you can see top brass from pro industry lobbying groups. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1989.6s)]
*  The Council of Better Business Bureaus, the National Association of Manufacturers and [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1994.56s)]
*  the newly formed Business Roundtable that, along with the Chamber of Commerce, would [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=1999.08s)]
*  define a new power structure on Capitol Hill for decades to come. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2004.12s)]
*  So, Jared, did you find audio from the meeting? [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2009.04s)]
*  Sadly, no. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2011.8799999999999s)]
*  But I did find the typed out speakers notes from the presentation. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2013.36s)]
*  So how about we do another reenactment? [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2017.52s)]
*  All right. Through the magic of podcasting, let's go now into the room where this [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2019.3999999999999s)]
*  secret meeting took place. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2025.08s)]
*  Who controls the British crown? [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2028.9199999999998s)]
*  Who keeps the metric system down? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2031.04s)]
*  No, it wasn't quite like the stone cutters on The Simpsons. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2033.8799999999999s)]
*  No purple robes or weird symbols. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2037.8s)]
*  These VIPs were probably all wearing suits and ties. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2040.24s)]
*  As the men settle into their seats, everyone turns to the head of the table to listen [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2043.32s)]
*  to the convener of the meeting, William White, the U.S. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2051.04s)]
*  Steel lobbyist who'd coordinated that previous meeting at the Polynesian hotel and who [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2054.68s)]
*  just finished assisting with his friend, President Gerald Ford's transition into the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2060.12s)]
*  White House. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2065.16s)]
*  All right, gentlemen, let's get started. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2065.84s)]
*  Please have a seat. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2067.68s)]
*  White begins by explaining how after a year of closely studying the Powell memo, the [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2068.32s)]
*  Chamber's board officially approved a plan of action around the conclusion that there [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2074.2000000000003s)]

*  acceptance with the general public. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2087.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you heard that right. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2088.92s)]
*  America's corporate titans are sitting at a giant table in a Roman columned fortress, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2090.76s)]

*  of the free world. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2102.72s)]
*  And somehow they perceive themselves as the victims struggling for acceptance. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2104.0s)]
*  Imagine Darth Vader and the Emperor at the control panel of the Death Star lamenting [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2110.12s)]
*  that they're unpopular and have no power. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2115.0s)]
*  Anyway, White addresses the big question. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2117.6s)]
*  How are things progressing with the master plan? [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2120.8399999999997s)]
*  Quite well, it seems. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2123.88s)]
*  The room goes dark and a beam of light from a slide projector shines onto the screen. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2125.48s)]
*  White explains how the task force's lobbying helped convince Congress to amend the new [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2132.8399999999997s)]
*  election laws to allow for corporate PAC spending just as they had planned back at [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2138.2799999999997s)]
*  Disney World. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2143.52s)]
*  Congress has enacted most of the reforms we sought and notably we helped to stave off [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2144.16s)]
*  that drive for public financing of congressional races. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2150.56s)]
*  Now, White moves on to the next issue, judicial action. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2156.52s)]
*  You may recall that the Powell memo recommended mimicking Ralph Nader's focus on the [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2160.2s)]
*  courts, filing lawsuits designed to get specific policy outcomes and amicus briefs [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2164.52s)]
*  pressuring judges to deliver specific rulings. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2170.12s)]
*  Since expanding the program, the chamber has participated or is in the process of doing [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2173.16s)]
*  so in 13 cases. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2178.52s)]
*  White brags that the chamber has participated in cases over things like whether unemployment [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2180.72s)]
*  benefits should be paid to striking workers or changing the guidelines for how chemicals [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2185.8s)]
*  can be discharged into waterways. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2190.84s)]
*  We have been successful in gaining our point of view and important instances, and we expect [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2194.0s)]
*  these judicial actions to be one of the most far reaching and productive elements [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2201.08s)]
*  resulting from task force recommendations. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2208.56s)]
*  White says the chamber has educational programs, symposiums and conferences going on [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2213.84s)]
*  nationwide to create a rapport and a better understanding of our private enterprise system [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2218.7599999999998s)]
*  among youth and educators. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2225.68s)]
*  They're giving lesson plans to teachers. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2228.7599999999998s)]
*  A new package of audio visual materials to increase economic understanding that includes [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2230.84s)]
*  slide presentations about profits and productivity. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2236.88s)]
*  Our profits kit is a best seller. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2240.76s)]
*  White mentions a pilot television program with the Texas Council on Economic Education [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2245.1200000000003s)]
*  entitled Everybody Knows What Profit Is. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2250.36s)]
*  The entire series may run to 30 films with a budget of five million dollars. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2253.92s)]
*  Sounds like must see TV. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2258.6000000000004s)]
*  Their media outreach effort is massive, now including [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2261.8s)]
*  a weekly column to more than 500 press and 300 radio and television outlets. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  Public service spots to over 750 radio stations. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2273.04s)]
*  A monthly cable television feature used by more than 200 stations with a viewing audience [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2278.2000000000003s)]
*  of more than four million. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2283.6000000000004s)]
*  And monthly editorials used by 70 television stations, 225 radio stations and 300 newspapers. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2286.0s)]
*  Just like the one on AM radio that we heard at the top of this episode. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  White concludes a lot has happened since last November, but of course, much more needs to be done. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2300.0400000000004s)]
*  OK, so here's the question. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2310.4s)]
*  What then was done after this meeting? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2312.48s)]
*  What specifically? [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2315.48s)]
*  Well, on the media front, they launched an operation to change the hearts and minds of [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2316.76s)]
*  normie Americans. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2321.92s)]
*  One guy in that room, a powerful advertising executive named Bart Cummings, spearheaded [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2323.52s)]
*  a massive PSA campaign through the ad council. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2329.08s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. I thought ad council ads weren't political. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2332.6800000000003s)]
*  I remember them being really mom and apple pie kind of stuff like Smokey the Bear. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2336.44s)]
*  Yeah, that's the way I remember them, too. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2341.32s)]
*  But in the 1970s, Cummings and the Ford administration partnered with the ad council to do a comically [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2343.48s)]
*  ideological ad series about validating capitalism, a campaign funded by corporate giants like [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2350.12s)]
*  Procter and Gamble, Mobil Oil, Exxon, William White's own U.S. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2356.84s)]
*  Steel, all in partnership with the U.S. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2361.6s)]
*  government. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2364.36s)]
*  The ad seemed ripped right out of the Powell memo itself, touting the American economic [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2373.1200000000003s)]
*  system. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2378.32s)]
*  Yeah, and the ad sponsors had a solution to this problem. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2384.28s)]
*  More Powell memo inspired propaganda. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2388.36s)]
*  They put up billboards, ran magazine ads and aired radio spots. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2391.3599999999997s)]
*  Cummings and the ad council highlighted all of this as one of their best PSA campaigns [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2395.64s)]
*  ever for how effective it was in building the American public's support for free market [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2401.08s)]
*  capitalism. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2407.12s)]
*  And remember the film projects that the Chamber of Commerce said it was putting into production [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2408.04s)]
*  as part of the Powell memo task force? [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2412.64s)]
*  Well, this is one that the chamber released in 1976 for the 200th anniversary of America's [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2415.2000000000003s)]
*  founding. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2421.7200000000003s)]
*  Narrated by Jimmy Stewart. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2424.0s)]
*  So Jimmy Stewart, the guy who in 1939 played an earnest government reforming outsider in [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2445.8s)]
*  Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, he was working with Washington insiders in 1976 to convince [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2452.8s)]
*  the public that the government is the problem? [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2460.04s)]
*  Is the problem? [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2462.92s)]
*  Okay, so in less than five years, a secret manifesto has mushroomed into a nationwide [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2470.28s)]
*  celebrity studded multimedia propaganda machine that's literally reshaping how Americans [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2476.84s)]
*  think about capitalism. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2483.1200000000003s)]
*  But what about the plan to legalize corruption? [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2485.2000000000003s)]
*  How's that going? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2488.4s)]
*  Well, they're definitely working on it. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2489.32s)]
*  You heard that they helped weaken FICA, but they weren't stopping there. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2491.52s)]
*  Remember this part of the Powell memo? [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2495.24s)]
*  Neglected opportunity in the courts. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2497.3599999999997s)]
*  The master planners knew that they had to solidify their agenda in the courts. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2500.2799999999997s)]
*  Right around this time, the Chamber of Commerce began building the foundation of what would [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2505.56s)]
*  become the National Chamber Litigation Center and other groups that now routinely secure [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2510.3199999999997s)]
*  favorable court rulings on stuff like campaign finance. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2516.08s)]
*  An example of one of those new Powell memo inspired groups is the Pacific Legal Foundation, [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2519.7599999999998s)]
*  which becomes a litigation powerhouse thanks to an early boost from this guy. [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2525.7999999999997s)]
*  Some time ago, I talked about an organization called the Pacific Legal Foundation. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2531.04s)]
*  It's a nonprofit public interest law firm which dedicates itself to upholding the [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2535.16s)]
*  Constitution and protecting the public interest against such special interests as the so [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2539.0s)]
*  called welfare rights groups, government bureaus and those ultra environmentalist [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2543.88s)]
*  organizations which would deny you and me the right to swat a mosquito. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2548.56s)]
*  This is Ronald Reagan. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2551.88s)]
*  Thanks for listening. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2553.12s)]
*  By the end of 1974, after all these secret meetings, the master plans key pieces are [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2553.96s)]
*  now in place. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2560.16s)]
*  The Supreme Court now includes the author of the Powell memo. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2561.48s)]
*  The president is a guy who attended the meeting to organize the memo's implementation. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2565.08s)]
*  The public is being immersed in the memo's ideology. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2570.2799999999997s)]
*  And now outside organizations like the Pacific Legal Foundation have been built and they're [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2573.92s)]
*  ready to begin moving the justice system towards legalizing corruption. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2579.24s)]
*  Now it's just a matter of finding the right opportunity. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2583.96s)]
*  And here in the mid 1970s, that opportunity is about to present itself. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2587.56s)]
*  We'll hear arguments today in Buckley against Vallejo and others. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2594.04s)]
*  Council, you may proceed whenever you're ready. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWiqxPbbsAw&t=2601.44s)]
