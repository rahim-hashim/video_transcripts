# Episode 3: The Powell Memo | Master Plan
**The Master Plan:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ)
*  I'm gonna play you a recording. It's something of an artifact, a vinyl record, that almost [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=0.0s)]
*  no one has heard in the last 50 years. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=8.64s)]
*  Louis F. Powell Jr. began the practice of law in Virginia in the year 1932. His intellect, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=11.52s)]
*  his dedication, and his great qualities as a human being became widely known and appreciated [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=18.8s)]
*  by his peers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=24.6s)]
*  That's the iconic voice of Walter Cronkite, the CBS News anchor who you've heard in previous [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=25.6s)]
*  episodes delivering reports on the Watergate scandal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=30.68s)]
*  In a 64th year, he can look back upon a distinguished career equaled by very few. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=33.8s)]
*  In addition to his anchor gig, Cronkite, in the mid-20th century, hosted a popular radio [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=39.6s)]
*  and TV program called You Are There. It used fictional reenactments to teach the audience [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=44.96s)]
*  about historical events and figures, presenting them as if they were being covered live. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=50.86s)]
*  Prior episode topics included the Battle of Gettysburg and the Boston Tea Party. For this [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=67.58s)]
*  one, Cronkite focused on a different monumental event. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=72.7s)]
*  On December 6, 1971, the Senate confirmed the nomination of Louis F. Powell Jr. to the [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=76.42s)]
*  Supreme Court of the United States. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=82.92s)]
*  But this edition of You Are There was never broadcast. It was never intended to be heard [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=85.7s)]
*  by anyone outside of a hundred or so attendees gathered for the annual Christmas luncheon [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=90.76s)]
*  for Philip Morris, Inc. You might recall Philip Morris as the tobacco giant behind dozens [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=96.06s)]
*  of cigarette brands, including Marlboro and Virginia Slims. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=102.14s)]
*  The event at the swanky 21 Club in Midtown Manhattan brought together corporate executives, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=105.92s)]
*  board members, and shareholders to celebrate Louis Powell and his confirmation to the United [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=111.76s)]
*  States Supreme Court. In his opening remarks, Philip Morris's longtime chairman and CEO, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=117.68s)]
*  Joseph Coleman, declared Powell's Supreme Court appointment, quote, without question, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=123.44s)]
*  the greatest single honor ever bestowed upon anyone connected with Philip Morris. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=129.24s)]
*  For this smoke-filled celebration, money was no object. The 20-minute spoof of You [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=135.56s)]
*  Are There included the real-life Walter Cronkite, often cited as the most trusted man in America. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=140.96s)]
*  He was there in person at the event with a cast of actors performing scripted skits recounting [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=148.08s)]
*  key moments in Louis Powell's life and career. It starts with him growing up in Richmond, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=154.3s)]
*  Virginia. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Powell! Mr. Powell! I just come from your house. Congratulations. Your wife just [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=160.92s)]
*  gave birth to a baby boy. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=165.76s)]
*  Well, that's really good news. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=167.44s)]
*  Then the program spotlights Powell being asked by President Nixon to fill a Supreme Court [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=169.64s)]
*  seat. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  We will now continue our committee hearings on Mr. Louis Powell's nomination. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  So why was Powell being celebrated by Philip Morris? Because when he was nominated, he [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=180.82s)]
*  was on the boards of several major companies, including, wait for it, yes, Philip Morris. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=186.56s)]
*  In fact, he'd been crucial in helping the cigarette maker navigate the growing legal [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=192.56s)]
*  and regulatory scrutiny over public health concerns about smoking. And now Philip Morris's [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=197.6s)]
*  own guy, Louis Powell, was going to be on the Supreme Court. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=203.0s)]
*  The live show in Manhattan concluded, I shit you not, with the head of Philip Morris presenting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=208.8s)]
*  Louis Powell with a black Supreme Court justice robe emblazoned with giant logos for Marlboro [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=215.28s)]
*  cigarettes and other Philip Morris brands, just like a NASCAR driver. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=222.6s)]
*  It almost seems too hard to believe, but we found pictures of the robe to prove it. There's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=228.04s)]
*  a link in our show notes. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=232.6s)]
*  Obviously, this was a pretty strange event, and the robe was likely a gag gift. But still, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=234.52s)]
*  the following day, Powell wrote a heartfelt thank you letter to Coleman for the gifts [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=240.04s)]
*  to him and his wife, which also included a crystal sculpture and a watch. But Powell [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=244.44000000000003s)]
*  wrote, quote, sentimentally, I think we like the Philip Morris robe best of all. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=250.4s)]
*  Philip Morris was rejoicing because Powell was one of their own, a distinguished member [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  of the political and business gentry ascending to the nation's highest court. But there [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=261.72s)]
*  was another, more covert reason for the corporate elite's glee. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=266.40000000000003s)]
*  Earlier that year, Lewis Powell had written a confidential memo that was the founding [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=271.44s)]
*  document of the entire master plan. Maybe you've heard of it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=276.79999999999995s)]
*  This master plan that was set out in the Lewis Powell memo, and I'd advise you to go and [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=281.0s)]
*  look it up. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=287.76s)]
*  We did look it up. In this episode, we're going to turn our gaze away from Congress [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=288.76s)]
*  and the presidency toward another set of characters operating deep in the background, catalyzing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=293.2s)]
*  a highly organized underground effort to build an entirely new political coalition, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=299.04s)]
*  one that legalized corruption in order to cement the political power of big business. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Master Plan. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=311.20000000000005s)]
*  When we first started looking into the story of how corruption was legalized in America, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=329.20000000000005s)]
*  I knew we'd be looking at key Supreme Court rulings and the Watergate scandal. But there [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=343.20000000000005s)]
*  was also this one name that kept showing up everywhere, Lewis F. Powell. He's not exactly [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=348.12s)]
*  a household name. Don't feel bad if you don't know much about him. Lewis Powell sat on the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=355.04s)]
*  Supreme Court in the 1970s and 80s. He was appointed by Richard Nixon, but he had a reputation [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=359.52000000000004s)]
*  as this moderate, chill dude who everyone got along with. Here he is after being overwhelmingly [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1971. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=370.62s)]
*  You can see why people described Powell as a mixture of aw-shucks humility and witty [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=385.04s)]
*  grace. It's also why he was uniformly liked. His friends, family, and biographers used [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=393.8s)]
*  words like calm, affable, sensible, self-effacing. In a 1978 documentary, here's how Powell described [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=399.24s)]
*  his early years on the court, when he wanted to earn his place among the veteran justices. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=406.12s)]
*  Doorkeeper. I was the highest paid doorkeeper in the world for five years. When Powell finally [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=415.04s)]
*  hung up his robe in 1987, the liberal crowd applauded him for being a centrist. Here's [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=420.48s)]
*  Democratic Congresswoman Pat Schroeder. I think everybody is very disappointed because [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=425.56s)]
*  Justice Powell was a great moderating influence and he was not running around with an ideological [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=429.78000000000003s)]
*  bit in his mouth. Here's the ACLU. We see the replacement of Justice Powell to be a [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=436.28000000000003s)]
*  very critical appointment to the court and we hope that Congress and the president will [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=440.4s)]
*  treat this as a very critical appointment and maintain the balance that the court now [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=445.52s)]
*  demonstrates. Here are the Ivy League law professors. He was a moderate. His moderation [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=449.28s)]
*  was both his virtue and his vice to practicing lawyers and court watchers. And here are the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=454.02s)]
*  journalists. And this is the person of the most enormous gentility and gentleness. I [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=458.59999999999997s)]
*  can't imagine him ever saying a harsh word to anyone. And you can't help but have enormous [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=464.68s)]
*  affection for him. But here's the thing. If you dig deeper into Lewis Powell's life, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=470.6s)]
*  you find something much different than these descriptions. You find one of the original [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=476.16s)]
*  master planners meticulously outlining a blueprint for the corporate takeover of America. This [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=481.1s)]
*  wasn't a moderate milquetoast guy. This was an angry man writing an angry screed that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=487.52s)]
*  became one of the major viral manifestos of the late 20th century. This manifesto came [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=493.74s)]
*  to be known as the Powell memo. The now infamous Powell memo. The Powell memo. The Powell memo. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=500.1s)]
*  The Powell memorandum. Every so often it gets mentioned to contextualize what's happening [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=506.54s)]
*  today. For instance, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse has given a series of floor speeches on its [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=511.26s)]
*  impact. The secret report may well have been the single most consequential piece of writing [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=516.5s)]
*  that Lewis Powell ever did in a long career of consequential writing. Whitehouse methodically [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=521.44s)]
*  connected the Powell memo to the right wing takeover of the Supreme Court. Mr. President, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=527.1600000000001s)]
*  the effort to capture the court has likely been the most effectual deployment of right [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=532.46s)]
*  wing and corporate resources into our common American political life. And yet, despite [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=539.6s)]
*  how influential and significant the memo was and how much it still defines American [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=547.78s)]
*  politics today, it remains omitted from the official history of the country. And in the [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  rare instance that it gets a mention in the media, it almost sounds fake, like some boogeyman [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=558.66s)]
*  manufactured by liberals desperate to come up with an explanation for their loss of power. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=564.1s)]
*  Are you familiar with the Lewis Powell memorandum? No. You know, a fellow who ended up in the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court, he wrote a memorandum to the National Chamber of Commerce in which he said [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=573.7s)]
*  there's too much democracy and as a threat to capitalism. That's Dick Van Dyke. And he [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=579.34s)]
*  might sound like he's exaggerating, but he's not. And yet the Powell memo seems to have [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=585.1s)]
*  been scrubbed out of America's memory. Okay, here's what I don't understand, David. That's [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=590.6600000000001s)]
*  master plan producer Jared J. Kang Maher, who spent the last two years digging deep [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=595.62s)]
*  I read the entire official biography of Lewis F. Powell. It's like 700 pages long. It was written [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=601.82s)]
*  by a legal scholar who was once one of Powell's clerks at the Supreme Court, and it does not [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=607.82s)]
*  mention the memo once. As a justice, Powell cast important votes on some very key cases, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=612.7800000000001s)]
*  abortion, school prayer, the death penalty, affirmative action. Affirmative action was [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=619.62s)]
*  probably the biggest one where he was the fifth vote to allow it. These were the big social issues [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=624.62s)]
*  of the 80s and 90s, and he was seen as a swing vote or a moderate. I think Lewis Powell has never [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=630.2199999999999s)]
*  been a man with a mission, as it were, or an agenda. Justice Powell has been a healer on the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=635.3399999999999s)]
*  court. But meanwhile, in cases dealing with the rights of corporations and about campaign [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=640.3s)]
*  finance laws, Powell took positions that weren't so moderate. And the long-term effects of those [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=645.66s)]
*  court decisions on the economy and the environment, for example, didn't become obvious until decades [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=651.02s)]
*  later. Yeah, and a lot of crazy stuff was going on in the early 1970s. And that's probably part [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=656.06s)]
*  of the reason why this memo, which he wrote only a few months before getting on the court, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=663.9s)]
*  never really caught the public's attention. Powell never spoke publicly about it. He later said that [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=668.54s)]
*  it was something that he'd written up in his free time in 1971, basically as a favor to an old friend. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=674.3s)]
*  And he told people that he sent the memo off to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and nothing much [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=679.9s)]
*  came of it. End of story. So what exactly was the memo? Well, we'll get to that. And we've got a [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=684.86s)]
*  little surprise for listeners. Later on, we've got another famous Lewis who's going to help us [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=690.38s)]
*  reenact the memo in all its glory. You need to find the script. What is all right? Now we're ready to go. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=695.42s)]
*  But first, in order to understand why the Powell memo was so pivotal at the time it was written [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=701.34s)]
*  and why it was so integral to the larger master plan, we need to get a better understanding of [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=707.34s)]
*  the man who wrote it. So here's the big question we had about Lewis Powell. How did this southern [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=712.94s)]
*  gentleman, known as the friendliest guy in town, this genteel corporate lawyer whose core virtues [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=722.0600000000001s)]
*  were supposedly his pragmatism and moderation, how did this guy become the author of a stridently [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=728.3800000000001s)]
*  ideological manifesto and an early architect of the dystopia that we live in today? To answer [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=735.4200000000001s)]
*  that question, Jared went to visit the official Lewis F. Powell archives in the small historic [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=741.98s)]
*  town of Lexington, Virginia. The buildings all have this kind of colonial style. It's a small campus [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=748.22s)]
*  here at Washington and Lee University, but very pretty. I can see why people would want to go to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=758.46s)]
*  school here. So this is where Powell went to college before going to Harvard Law School, right? [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=766.0600000000001s)]
*  Yes, indeed. The Washington and Lee University School of Law. They have a whole wing named after [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=771.9s)]
*  him. I walked into the library and there's this huge painted portrait of him on the wall where [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=777.34s)]
*  he's sitting in his black robe. He's tall, thin, wire-rimmed glasses and has a high pointy hairline. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=781.74s)]
*  I think he looks a little bit like Orville Redenbacher. Do you remember Orville Redenbacher? [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=789.1s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah. The popcorn guy, right? [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=793.66s)]
*  Yeah, but more scholarly. To get into the archive, I took an elevator down to the basement. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=795.42s)]
*  The archivist, Jennifer Mitchell, was so helpful and seemed excited to show me around. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=800.86s)]
*  I don't think she gets a lot of visitors. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=806.4599999999999s)]
*  So it starts here and continues all the way up through box like 800 something. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=810.62s)]
*  Picture a large windowless room with rows and rows of accordion shelves, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=816.54s)]
*  and on them are hundreds of numbered boxes. The Powell papers are extensive. They cover his life [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=821.3399999999999s)]
*  from almost beginning to end. We have materials related to his time here at Washington and Lee. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=829.58s)]
*  We have materials from when he was a lawyer in private practice. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=836.46s)]
*  In World War II, Powell worked as an intelligence officer on the Super Secret Ultra Project. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=840.86s)]
*  This is like high-level code breaking and spy stuff. And after the war, in addition to having [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=845.98s)]
*  a prosperous legal practice, he did a lot. Chair of the Richmond City School Board, he served on the [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=851.1800000000001s)]
*  Virginia State Board of Education, president of the American Bar Association, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=856.86s)]
*  and he sat on several presidential commissions. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=861.1800000000001s)]
*  And he saved, he took notes, like when he had his initial phone calls and preparations for his [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=863.98s)]
*  confirmation hearings, he would, you know, make notations, correspond with folks. All of that is saved. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=870.86s)]
*  Clearly, Lewis Powell was a meticulous record keeper and he kept just about everything, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=878.14s)]
*  which turned out great for us. Yeah, the recording with Walter Cronkite, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=883.82s)]
*  it was kind of an urban legend. So I was shocked when the vinyl record turned up in a box that no [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=887.58s)]
*  one had ever checked before. The archives had everything. I mean, we have his uniform from [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=893.1s)]
*  World War II, have four pairs of his socks in the collection. But we weren't interested in [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=897.98s)]
*  Lewis Powell's socks. Lewis Powell was 64 when he got on the Supreme Court, one of the oldest [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=904.5400000000001s)]
*  nominees in history. He'd had an entire long career and was basically at retirement age by [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=910.46s)]
*  the time he wrote the memo. So Jared, what did you find that tells us about his influences? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=916.0600000000001s)]
*  Well, while sifting through his boxes of old letters, correspondence, speeches, legal analysis, [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=922.46s)]
*  I was like, damn, this dude was industrious. This is him using a dictaphone in 1956. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=928.7s)]
*  What is in a position? This is a heading initial caps underscore question mark paragraph. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=934.9399999999999s)]
*  For listeners who don't know what a dictaphone is, it was basically like a text to speech [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=941.42s)]
*  transcription app. Except in this case, the app was an actual human secretary named Liz, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=946.3s)]
*  who physically typed all his words directly onto paper. The use of this name, correction Liz, [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=951.98s)]
*  like the use of this name, but a comma. His whole career, Powell was apparently relentless [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=959.42s)]
*  with the dictaphone. This was a man who was not just extremely smart and highly ambitious. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=965.9s)]
*  He also had lots of ideas about how the world should work. Okay, so where did these ideas come [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=971.26s)]
*  from? There are three main facets to Powell that stood out for me. His professional formation at a [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=977.74s)]
*  particular kind of corporate law firm in Richmond, his deep fear of communism, and his work aiding [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=982.86s)]
*  the tobacco industry. Okay, so Richmond, Virginia, let's start there, where young Lewis grew up [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=989.66s)]
*  steeped in old Southern values and traditions. Oh, man, I love the Dukes of Hazard. I think we need [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=995.26s)]
*  to go back a little further. How's that better? Is that better? Is that deliverance? Yeah, man. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1006.54s)]
*  That's a little too backwards. Okay, there we go. There we go. Richmond, Virginia was the capital of [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1013.5s)]
*  the Confederacy during the Civil War. After reconstruction, it emerged as an economic hub [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1021.26s)]
*  in the early 1900s. The growth of the tobacco industry, banking, railroads, and manufacturing [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1026.62s)]
*  all converged to transform the city into a central power for the New South, this one based around [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1032.06s)]
*  corporate enterprise. Powell's family wasn't wealthy, but his father could trace his roots [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1038.54s)]
*  back to Captain Nathaniel Powell of the original Jamestown settlers. After college, Powell returned [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1043.66s)]
*  to Richmond and earned a job that would come to define his life and career. No, man. Powell wasn't [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1049.82s)]
*  running moonshine in a muscle car with a Confederate flag painted on top. Powell was a good [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1058.94s)]
*  boy with legitimate career goals. He joined a law office in Richmond that represented big business [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1064.22s)]
*  trying to avoid government rules and regulations. The firm's founder had made a name for himself by [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1069.5800000000002s)]
*  helping railroad companies fight off regulators in Virginia. Rockefellers, railroad barons, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1075.02s)]
*  that was their bread and butter. Okay, so Lewis Powell, more boss hog than the Duke boys. Got it. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1081.02s)]
*  Correct. And as the firm's post-war clientele grew from small local companies into multinational [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1086.7s)]
*  conglomerates, Powell was one of the lawyers working hard to deregulate financial laws. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1093.66s)]
*  By the 1960s, Powell had become one of the most prominent lawyers in Richmond and a fixture of the [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1099.02s)]
*  city's elite establishment. Powell and his colleagues weren't just legal advisors. They [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1105.1000000000001s)]
*  were deeply involved in business strategy and decision making, and they were often rewarded [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1110.6200000000001s)]
*  with shares in the companies they represented. Powell held seats on the boards of major companies [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1115.82s)]
*  like the Ethel Corporation, Brooks Brothers, various Virginia banks, and yes, Philip Morris. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1121.5s)]
*  That's right. And remember the vinyl record of Walter Cronkite celebrating Lewis Powell at that [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1127.6599999999999s)]
*  party? Well, they did a gag reenacting the moment that Powell joined the company. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1132.7s)]
*  However, his career reached a new high when Mr. Joseph Coleman said to him, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1137.26s)]
*  Congratulations, Lewis. You have just been elected to the board of directors of Philip [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1141.98s)]
*  Morris, Incorporated. Thank you very much. I shall always look back upon this moment. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1145.26s)]
*  And this brings us to the second major influence on Powell before he wrote his memo, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1152.86s)]
*  the tobacco industry. We will continue with our program after this important message from our sponsor. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1157.82s)]
*  Do you remember the Marlboro man? Man, that guy's theme music was everywhere when we were kids. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1163.34s)]
*  Oh, yeah. And he was on billboards and on television. This was actually a fake [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1175.8999999999999s)]
*  commercial that Philip Morris played during that Walter Cronkite show about Powell. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1180.4599999999998s)]
*  It started in Richmond, Virginia and spread throughout the land. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1184.62s)]
*  Till today, Marlboro country is everywhere. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1188.62s)]
*  Come to where the flavor is. Come to Marlboro country. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1193.8999999999999s)]
*  In the mid 60s, Powell was one of the big defenders of Marlboro country. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1200.7s)]
*  And when the Surgeon General began issuing reports that linked smoking to cancer and other health [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1205.02s)]
*  problems, Philip Morris saw itself as under attack. But Philip Morris and the tobacco industry didn't [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1209.98s)]
*  just sit back and accept regulations. They went on the offensive, creating alternative [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1216.3s)]
*  organizations and pushing their own scientific reports to support their arguments to the media [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1221.4199999999998s)]
*  and in the courts. Its CEO, Joseph Coleman, was actively defending their product on programs like [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1226.94s)]
*  Face the Nation. And I concluded from that report that it's true. The babies born from women who [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1233.18s)]
*  smoke are smaller, but they're just as healthy as the babies born from women who do not smoke. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1239.4199999999998s)]
*  And some women would prefer having smaller babies. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1246.46s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait, wait. Women would prefer underweight babies? Yeah, that didn't age well. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1248.86s)]
*  Oh, it didn't go over well at the time either. But Philip Morris didn't back down. In March 1970, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1255.26s)]
*  Coleman and Philip Morris started using front groups to attack the American Cancer Society, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1261.02s)]
*  which was spotlighting the link between tobacco and cancer. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1266.06s)]
*  This is like what's now known as astroturfing. Corporations funding fake citizens groups to [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1268.94s)]
*  muddle the debate and basically lie to the public. Yeah. And when Powell was on Philip Morris's board, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1275.58s)]
*  the company basically invented this strategy. It was all documented decades later when federal [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1281.6599999999999s)]
*  prosecutors charged Philip Morris and other large tobacco companies with racketeering [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1286.9399999999998s)]
*  and later when states won huge class action lawsuits against the industry. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1291.74s)]
*  And so where was Lewis Powell in all of this? Well, he certainly wasn't just an observer [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1295.58s)]
*  watching from the boardroom. As legal counsel, he helped craft these programs, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1300.46s)]
*  guiding specific lobbying efforts, communication strategies, and legal frameworks, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1304.94s)]
*  all in an effort to protect profits and sow doubts about any adverse health claims. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1309.66s)]
*  Let me read you this one letter from May 1970. Powell wrote to Coleman. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1314.54s)]
*  Wait a minute, wait, wait. Make it sound like you're talking into Lewis Powell's dictaphone. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1319.8200000000002s)]
*  As you know, I have long thought that the tobacco industry could not continue indefinitely to ignore [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1324.8600000000001s)]
*  the extremism and lack of regard for the truth manifested by the American Cancer Society and [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1330.22s)]
*  others. I believe your recent moves have been justified and constructive. At the very least, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1335.66s)]
*  the American Cancer Society is likely to be more restrained in the future. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1341.02s)]
*  And to be clear, Powell is writing this to Philip Morris's CEO, even though he and the [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1345.5s)]
*  tobacco industry knew based on their own studies that cigarettes were killing people. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1350.6200000000001s)]
*  And you have to understand this campaign that Powell was involved in, this was a sophisticated [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1356.6200000000001s)]
*  PR effort that mixed lobbying, media relations, litigation, and industry groups to prevent [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1361.74s)]
*  anything that would hinder their profits. And they were extremely successful. In 1971, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1367.18s)]
*  Philip Morris saw record revenues. By the way, this was the same year they hosted the Walter [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1372.8600000000001s)]
*  Cronkite Radio Party for Lewis Powell. But while Powell was helping Philip Morris cover up tobacco's [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1378.5400000000002s)]
*  health risks, he also had a side obsession. Which leads us to our third and final major [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1384.46s)]
*  influence on Powell, one that we were shocked to find. While digging around the Powell archives, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1389.98s)]
*  I found letters showing that starting in the 1960s, Powell began a regular correspondence [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1394.94s)]
*  with FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who infamously used the agency to target alleged communists in [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1400.94s)]
*  every aspect of American society. It turns out that while Powell was president of the American Bar [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1408.22s)]
*  Association and a member on the Virginia Board of Education, he was functioning as an SAC contact. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1413.5s)]
*  Okay, wait, what's an SAC contact? It's an FBI term for a confidential informant. Or you could [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1419.98s)]
*  say it was someone that the FBI was really close and friendly with. A trusted friend they could [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1426.94s)]
*  call upon to provide information, like in Powell's case, about possible communist activities in the [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1432.22s)]
*  legal profession. Okay, so this fine, upstanding, polite guy, Lewis Powell, is also kind of like [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1437.66s)]
*  J. Edgar Hoover's eyes and ears on the legal profession. Yeah, and not only that. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1444.0600000000002s)]
*  Into the late 1960s, Powell was corresponding frequently with Hoover's most trusted lieutenant, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1449.26s)]
*  sharing his concerns about communism and left-wing activism. This high-level FBI official was giving [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1454.7s)]
*  Powell agency intelligence about the operations and financials of the new left. Powell was thinking [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1460.5400000000002s)]
*  a lot about this new breed of political activists and college campus organizers. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1466.46s)]
*  He was very interested in a report called Confrontation Politics, which analyzed the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1471.5s)]
*  rhetorical style of these radical groups. In one letter, Hoover's guy recommended that Powell check [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1476.7s)]
*  out a newly published book called Revolution for the Hell of It. That's the one by Abbie Hoffman. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1481.74s)]
*  Yeah, here's what Hoover's guy wrote to Powell. Quote, Hoffman is the leader of the Youth [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1486.78s)]
*  International Party, Yippies, and a self-admitted anarchist and revolutionary. This book might give [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1491.74s)]
*  you some insights into the new leftist mentality. While Powell's correspondence with the FBI was [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1497.02s)]
*  secret, Powell was becoming more public about his crusades against communism and for law and order. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1501.9s)]
*  He began making political speeches around the country amid the protests and chaos of the 1960s. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1508.14s)]
*  Today, there are others with quite opposite goals who insist with equal fervor that civil [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1514.06s)]
*  disobedience of laws deemed to be unjust is a legitimate means of asserting desired rights. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1521.34s)]
*  Tyranny is the inevitable result of this form of anarchy. Powell was internalizing, echoing, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1528.86s)]
*  and being radicalized by the same themes being promoted by conservative icons of this era. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1536.06s)]
*  Here's Ronald Reagan right around the same time. Unless we realize we're in a war that must be won, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1541.66s)]
*  those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1547.02s)]
*  have a utopian solution of peace without victory. This was a speech Reagan delivered in 1964 in [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1550.8600000000001s)]
*  support of Barry Goldwater's presidential campaign. You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1556.8600000000001s)]
*  there is a price we will not pay. There is a point beyond which they must not advance. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1562.3000000000002s)]
*  There's this two-year period between 1968 and 1970 where you can see Powell becoming increasingly [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1567.82s)]
*  alarmed about the direction of the country. One speech I found, it's called the attack on American [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1574.3s)]
*  institutions and it shows just how vehement he'd become. Yet these are not ordinary times and you [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1579.5s)]
*  are not an ordinary audience. You are the front line of the free enterprise system. Also, you are [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1585.34s)]
*  free enterprise system. Also, you are dedicated Americans who believe in our economic and political [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1591.5s)]
*  system, free American democracy. You believe that to be the best ever conceived by man. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1598.06s)]
*  I should mention that Richard Nixon was especially impressed with this speech by Powell in 1970. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1603.98s)]
*  Democracy and the values which it sustained are now under broad and virulent attack. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1609.9s)]
*  Broad and virulent attack. That line sounds like a sneak preview of what would soon become [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1615.9s)]
*  Powell's magnum opus for the US Chamber of Commerce. Yeah, and you can hear him forming the [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1621.8200000000002s)]
*  ideas and words that would later converge in his memo. In the speech, Powell read quotes by [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1627.5s)]
*  leftist figures like the lawyer who defended the Chicago Seven, Abbie Hoffman, and the Black Panther [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1633.74s)]
*  leader Eldridge Cleaver. And then he says, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1639.9s)]
*  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Lewis Powell just compare the Black Panthers to the Nazis? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1652.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I get them confused too, don't you? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1658.7s)]
*  Means of influencing thought and emotion are different in the modern world. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1669.9s)]
*  Okay, so Powell, like a lot of older white dudes of the time, was being radicalized against the [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1674.7s)]
*  radicals. And you can see this in the letters, how all of this was churning around in Powell's big [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1681.26s)]
*  brain. Can I show you one more letter? It leads up to the memo, I promise. Yeah, yeah, yeah, go ahead. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1686.8600000000001s)]
*  Okay, this is from a string of letters between Powell and this guy from Madison Avenue, William [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1691.98s)]
*  Rutter. Rutter was co-founder of the PR agency Rutter Finn, which was key to helping Philip [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1697.5s)]
*  Morris with their campaigns to deny the scientific evidence that smoking causes cancer. Rutter wrote [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1703.5s)]
*  to Powell, [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1709.58s)]
*  I enjoyed our discussion about the question of the whole free enterprise system and the open [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1710.22s)]
*  question as to who is going to be doing the work to make sure that in the long run it survives. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1714.94s)]
*  I think unfortunately that this is in the category of everybody's job and therefore nobody's, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1720.0600000000002s)]
*  and that's a real pity. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1724.94s)]
*  That whole free enterprise system rhetoric, it sounds really familiar. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1726.8600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, because a few months later, Powell would write about it in his memo. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1732.0600000000002s)]
*  Okay, I want you to imagine that it's 1971 and you're Lewis Powell and you're at the grocery store [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1740.8600000000001s)]
*  in Richmond, Virginia picking up a carton of Marlboro cigarettes. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1752.38s)]
*  Hang on, Powell didn't smoke. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1755.98s)]
*  Interesting. Guess he knew the cancer data after all. Anyway, so you're Lewis Powell and you're [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1758.5400000000002s)]
*  buying a carton of milk and you're waiting in line at the register, daydreaming about how much [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1765.18s)]
*  you hate commies and hippies. And there on the newsstand, you spot the latest issue of Fortune [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1770.78s)]
*  magazine. So you start leafing through it. And who do you see being heralded in a nine page profile? [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1777.1000000000001s)]
*  Consumer advocate Ralph Nader. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1783.66s)]
*  Ralph Nader. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1785.3400000000001s)]
*  Ralph Nader, that crusader for consumer protection. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1786.46s)]
*  In 1971, 37 year old Ralph Nader was on fire. His legal crusades made him literally a celebrity. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1789.66s)]
*  He was involved in everything from exposing corporate fraud to exposing political corruption, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1797.74s)]
*  including Nixon's dairy scandal, which you heard about in episode one. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1803.26s)]
*  Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, filed suit today charging that the administration and the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1807.18s)]
*  dairy industry illegally set up political front organizations. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1811.9s)]
*  Ralph Nader charged today that General Motors had violated the federal automobile safety law. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1815.82s)]
*  You think about what Nader's done all by himself in Detroit and in Washington and elsewhere, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1820.9399999999998s)]
*  multiply that by say 15 times. If you could have firms of people who were doing this kind of thing, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1825.26s)]
*  you'd be changing the equation of power in the state. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1830.78s)]
*  So if you're Lewis Powell in this imaginary check out line at the grocery in Richmond, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1833.74s)]
*  Virginia, and you spot your nemesis, Ralph Nader on the newsstand, you're now having an [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1838.22s)]
*  apoplectic meltdown. This guy you can't stand is now so famous that he's being profiled in your [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1844.3s)]
*  business pals favorite magazine. And now he's mounting a new crusade to pass the campaign [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1851.34s)]
*  finance laws that could stop you and your corporate allies from buying the politicians you need to get [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1857.18s)]
*  the policies you want. Okay. So maybe it wasn't in a grocery store, but we do know that this 1971 [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1863.5s)]
*  fortune piece on Nader is the thing that really drove Lewis Powell over the edge. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1869.5s)]
*  So what's that mean over the edge? [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1873.9s)]
*  So Powell goes and meets up with a longtime friend who also lived in Richmond, [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1876.6200000000001s)]
*  a guy named Gene Sidner. He had served in the Virginia State Senate, was extremely pro business, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1880.7s)]
*  and was the CEO of a chain of department stores. But most importantly, Sidner had recently become [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1885.98s)]
*  chair of the education committee of the US Chamber of Commerce, and he had high level connections with [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1892.14s)]
*  the group's leadership in Washington, DC. If any one organization could turn the tides on [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1898.22s)]
*  what Powell saw as the country's biggest problems, it would be the US Chamber of Commerce, [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1903.42s)]
*  the most powerful business lobbying organization in Washington. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1909.02s)]
*  Yeah, but first he needed to convince the chamber to go big, bigger and more audacious than they had [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1912.6200000000001s)]
*  ever gone before. So Powell got to work writing. And by the end of the summer, he'd completed this [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1917.9s)]
*  34 page type document complete with section headings and footnotes. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1924.3000000000002s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. Did he use his dictaphone? Please Jared, tell me you found Lewis Powell [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1929.1799999999998s)]
*  recording his memo. No, and believe me, I literally spent a year trying to find it. It was my white [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1934.1399999999999s)]
*  whale. I mean, if you would have found that. It could still be out there. But we came up with [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1940.54s)]
*  the next best thing. We found another famous Lewis who could capture the outrage dripping from the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1944.06s)]
*  text of this memo. Can you hear me? Talk to me. No, I can't see you at all. Not a fucking thing. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1949.58s)]
*  Hello, talk to me. Oh, come on. This is crazy. Wait, wait. Is that Lewis Black, the comedian, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1955.74s)]
*  the guy who literally plays the anger emotion in my kids favorite Pixar movie? Yes, exactly. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1962.3s)]
*  We got Lewis Black to read Lewis Powell's memo for us. There you are. Unbelievable. All right. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1968.78s)]
*  All right. Hold on. I'm going to close the door here. Ready? All right. Let's do it. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1975.02s)]
*  Confidential memorandum, date August 23rd, 1971 from Lewis F. Powell Jr. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1982.1399999999999s)]
*  As you'll hear in his memo, Powell was a man who was extremely deliberate in his choice of words. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1990.9399999999998s)]
*  No thoughtful person can question that the American economic system, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=1996.22s)]
*  variously called the free enterprise system, capitalism, and the profit system is under broad [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2000.86s)]
*  attack. And for this, Powell chose language that was explosive. The broad shotgun attack on the [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2007.82s)]
*  system itself. There are constant rifle shots which undermine confidence and confuse the public. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2014.22s)]
*  This is language meant to stir emotions. Business has been the favorite whipping boy [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2021.1s)]
*  of many politicians for many years. This is language that defined a common enemy. Perhaps [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2027.02s)]
*  the single most effective antagonist of American business is Ralph Nader, who thanks largely to [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2033.02s)]
*  the media has become a legend in his own time and an idol of millions of Americans. Whoa, whoa, whoa. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2040.62s)]
*  Hold on. What happened to the Lewis Powell that everyone described as Mr. Nice Guy? [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2047.42s)]
*  I can't imagine him ever saying a harsh word to anyone. Well, this is Mr. Angry. Powell is [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2052.06s)]
*  basically sounding an alarm about hippie barbarians at the gate. If our system is to survive, [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2058.46s)]
*  top management must be equally concerned with protecting and preserving the system itself. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2064.2200000000003s)]
*  This wasn't just a rant though. Powell had a plan to address the problem, a plan that could be [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2070.06s)]
*  executed by corporate America. It had just a few simple steps. Step one, spread conservative ideals [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2075.58s)]
*  in higher education. The campus, as these bright young men from campuses across the country, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2082.46s)]
*  seek opportunities to change the system, which they have been taught to distrust, if not indeed [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2088.7s)]
*  despise, they seek employment in the centers of real power and influence in our country. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2095.34s)]
*  I see. Just bright young men, huh? Yeah. This is peak Mad Men era. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2102.2200000000003s)]
*  Powell said the chamber can change the campus by funding various programs, including... [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2106.86s)]
*  A staff of scholars, staff of speakers, speakers bureau, evaluation of textbooks. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2111.74s)]
*  Then we get to step two, change the media. Television. The national television network [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2119.8999999999996s)]
*  should be monitored in the same way that textbooks should be kept under constant surveillance. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2125.58s)]
*  Powell wrote that infiltrating radio was also important, as was... [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2131.74s)]
*  Scholarly journals, books, paperbacks and pamphlets, paid advertisements. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2135.98s)]
*  Next up, step three, the neglected political arena. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2142.46s)]
*  Business must learn the lesson long ago learned by labor and other self-interest groups. This is the [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2149.18s)]
*  lesson that political power is necessary, that such power must be assiduously cultivated and that [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2155.98s)]
*  when necessary, it must be used aggressively and with determination without embarrassment [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2163.98s)]
*  and without the reluctance, which has been so characteristic of American business. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2169.58s)]
*  Powell said the chamber of commerce should consider assuming a broader and more... [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2174.46s)]
*  Vigorous role in the political arena. And finally, step four, the most important [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2179.26s)]
*  section by far, an area where Powell had unique expertise, take over the courts. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2184.78s)]
*  The judiciary may be the most important instrument for social, economic and political change. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2190.86s)]
*  Powell saw the legal system, especially the Supreme Court, as an underutilized front where [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2198.2200000000003s)]
*  business could be much more assertive. Perhaps the most active exploiters of the judicial system have [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2204.54s)]
*  been groups ranging in political orientation from liberal to the far left. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2210.94s)]
*  Powell wanted businesses to use the courts offensively to create a legal environment that [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2215.9s)]
*  was more favorable to their interests. Powell told business leaders to rip a page from the [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2221.34s)]
*  playbook of consumer advocates like his nemesis, Ralph Nader, who made his name filing public [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2226.06s)]
*  interest lawsuits. The Powell memo advised corporate executives to pursue their own lawsuits [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2230.62s)]
*  to challenge regulations and decisions that they felt were harmful to business interests. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2236.86s)]
*  The American Civil Liberties Union is one example. It initiates or intervenes in scores of causes [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2241.82s)]
*  each year, and it files briefs, amicus curiae, in the Supreme Court in a number of cases during [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2249.5s)]
*  each term of that court. Even if the chamber wasn't directly involved in the lawsuits, [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2256.86s)]
*  Powell suggested that business groups should be more active in filing amicus briefs, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2261.98s)]
*  special legal documents submitted by outside parties who want to influence judicial rulings. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2267.34s)]
*  The greatest care should be exercised in selecting the cases in which to participate, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2272.94s)]
*  or the suits to institute. But the opportunity merits the necessary effort. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2279.0200000000004s)]
*  And then, like any good business plan, Powell brought up the most important factor, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2285.5800000000004s)]
*  money. And lots of it. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2290.7s)]
*  This is a vast opportunity for the chamber if it is willing to undertake the role of spokesman [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2293.2599999999998s)]
*  for American business, and if in turn, business is willing to provide the funds. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2299.82s)]
*  Powell wrote that for a massive program like this to be successful, it must be a long-term [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2305.82s)]
*  undertaking, with significant staffing and resources which would require far more generous [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2312.22s)]
*  financial support from American corporations than the chamber has ever received in the past. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2318.06s)]
*  He concludes the memo doing his own version of Karl Marx's Workers of the World Unite sign-off. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2324.94s)]
*  Only he implores corporate leaders to get on board and start cutting checks or face extinction. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2331.34s)]
*  Really, it's more of CEOs of the world unite. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2337.74s)]
*  But this would be an exercise in futility unless the board of directors of the chamber [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2340.54s)]
*  accepts the fundamental premise of this paper. Namely, that business and the enterprise system [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2347.66s)]
*  are in deep trouble and the hour is late. Louis F. Powell Jr. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2355.42s)]
*  Okay, so Louis Powell gets pissed off at Ralph Nader and then writes this memo. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2361.98s)]
*  But memo clearly doesn't do it justice, no pun intended. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2367.3399999999997s)]
*  As we've just heard, it was really a full-scale manifesto, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2371.18s)]
*  6,000 words long, super strident, super detailed. And remember, Powell doesn't just put it in his [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2374.7799999999997s)]
*  drawer. He puts it in the hands of the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and it starts to [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2381.2599999999998s)]
*  quietly circulate among the most powerful people in the country. And then two months later, [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2387.18s)]
*  Louis Powell's phone rings. He picks it up and he's asked to hold for a very important caller. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2392.7s)]
*  Louis Powell on the line for you. Richard Nixon and Louis Powell had known [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2401.18s)]
*  each other for many years. They corresponded about their shared hatred of commies and campus leftists. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2405.1s)]
*  But this wasn't a random social call to shoot the shit. Nixon had a very important question for Powell. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2410.7799999999997s)]
*  I determine that your appointment at this time is what the court needs. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2417.3399999999997s)]
*  Would you undertake it if I were to ask you to do it? [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2421.8999999999996s)]
*  I think the answer is affirmative, Mr. President. I'm a fairly patriotic guy. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2424.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh, I know that. And I have. I know what you've done through the years. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2429.9s)]
*  That last line by Nixon is really important. I know what you've done through the years. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2433.1800000000003s)]
*  Nixon knew exactly who Powell was and exactly what Powell represented. In a private phone call with [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2437.6600000000003s)]
*  California Governor Ronald Reagan, Nixon characterized Powell as, quote, a corporation lawyer. For Nixon, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2443.98s)]
*  nominating Powell was a political masterstroke. Powell was conservative enough to get nominated [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2451.1800000000003s)]
*  by a Republican president, but seemed on the surface to be moderate enough to be accepted [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2457.1s)]
*  by a Democratic Congress. But the bottom line was, if Powell was confirmed, big business would get [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2462.46s)]
*  its man, the man with the plan, on the highest court in the land. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2469.2599999999998s)]
*  Who is the man with the master plan? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2473.66s)]
*  The United States Senate reserved the past two days for debate on the nomination of Louis Powell [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2476.06s)]
*  to become a justice of the United States Supreme Court. But the two days was not necessary and [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2481.2599999999998s)]
*  there wasn't even a whisper of opposition. In fact, the senators even ran out of praise. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2486.14s)]
*  Nobody was attacking Powell and you can only call a man great or outstanding so many times [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2490.7s)]
*  and still keep an audience. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2495.66s)]
*  Now, wait a minute. How is it that Democrats saw Powell as a moderate? Why didn't they put up any [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2497.02s)]
*  opposition to the author of the Powell memo? Well, that's the thing. The FBI did a background check [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2503.42s)]
*  of Powell and interviewed dozens of friends, colleagues and coworkers for its report to the [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2509.74s)]
*  Senate. But remember, the agency was run by Powell's pen pal, J. Edgar Hoover. And so, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2514.54s)]
*  conveniently, Powell's memo, the clearest statement of his actual political ideology that he bring to [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2520.62s)]
*  the Supreme Court, that memo did not show up in the FBI's report. Nor did the FBI mention [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2526.86s)]
*  Powell's close association with Hoover and Hoover's top lieutenant. And of course, they also left out [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2533.74s)]
*  Powell comparing liberal activists to Adolf Hitler. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2539.74s)]
*  The vote confirming Powell's nomination to the court was 89 to one. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2542.38s)]
*  Amazingly, only one guy in the entire Senate seems suspicious of Powell. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2546.06s)]
*  The only dissenting vote coming from Fred Harris of Oklahoma. Harris explained his contrary vote [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2550.94s)]
*  as a lack of confidence in a man he charged was an elitist with no compassion for little people. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2556.46s)]
*  If lawmakers had actually known about the Powell memorandum, there's a possibility that Senator [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2562.3s)]
*  Harris wouldn't have been alone. The Senate may have rejected Powell, according to Adam Winkler, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2567.5s)]
*  a UCLA professor and the author of the book, We the Corporations. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2572.78s)]
*  There were a lot of people sitting in Congress who had voted for many of the kinds of laws that [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2577.02s)]
*  Powell thought were so dangerous. Consumer regulation, highway safety regulation, civil [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2583.34s)]
*  rights laws and significant antitrust laws, etc. Had Justice Powell's strong pro-business [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2589.9s)]
*  views as expressed in the Chamber of Commerce memo been known, he might never have made it [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2598.14s)]
*  onto the Supreme Court. We'll never know because while the Powell memo circulated among the [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2604.3s)]
*  Chamber of Commerce crowd, it remained a secret to the outside world. But that changed once Powell [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2609.02s)]
*  was installed on the court and his memo got out. A few months after Powell was sworn in, his memo [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2615.9s)]
*  was leaked to Jack Anderson, a prominent Washington Post columnist known for exposing Nixon's corrupt [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2625.1800000000003s)]
*  activities. Anderson's article, headlined FBI Missed Blueprint by Powell, was syndicated [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2631.42s)]
*  nationwide, raising questions about why this aggressive political document was concealed [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2638.06s)]
*  during Powell's confirmation hearings. Powell himself never publicly addressed that controversy. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2643.66s)]
*  He downplayed the memo to his clerks and colleagues. He portrayed it as a quick, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2649.3399999999997s)]
*  informal favor for a friend, not a serious policy document. Meanwhile, corporate leaders, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2653.3399999999997s)]
*  upset by the negative press around the memo, rallied to Powell's defense. Fellow lawyers penned [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2659.18s)]
*  letters to newspaper editors criticizing the media coverage. Senator Harry F. Byrd, a longtime friend [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2664.54s)]
*  of Powell's, even took to the Senate floor to defend his fellow Virginian. Byrd said, quote, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2670.22s)]
*  in essence, the memorandum is a call to the business community of the United States [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2675.8999999999996s)]
*  to exercise its First Amendment right of free expression on its own behalf. In retrospect, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2681.02s)]
*  this pushback seems to be a tactic from Powell's own playbook, using the controversy as an [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2688.06s)]
*  opportunity to spread the message of the memo even further. In fact, Byrd had the full text [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2693.8199999999997s)]
*  of the memo submitted into the congressional record. It seemed like Powell's acolytes were [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2699.34s)]
*  ready to heed his words and fight back against the haters, or as he had called them, the Naders. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2704.1400000000003s)]
*  There should be no hesitation and every available means should be employed to challenge [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2709.7400000000002s)]
*  and refute their attacks. Overshadowed by other political scandals like the Watergate investigation, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2715.5s)]
*  the leak of the Powell memo faded from the media's memory and Powell worked hard to burnish his public [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2720.6200000000003s)]
*  image as a moderate, genteel lawyer. Even when Powell died in 1998, his obituary in the Washington [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2726.06s)]
*  Post didn't mention the memo. It seemed lost to history, but the memo did not go away. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2733.2599999999998s)]
*  It was eerie when I first read the contents of that memo. That's Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2741.9s)]
*  Because so much of what you see right now playing out at the hands of the far right [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2746.38s)]
*  was recommended in that memo. That you needed to control the court, that you needed to control [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2753.42s)]
*  the media, that you needed to have rapid response on college campuses. Whitehouse told us that the [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2759.98s)]
*  Powell memo is still the master plan today, one that catalyzed a conspiracy to legalize [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2766.78s)]
*  corruption and take over Washington. You can see the blueprint for the corporate political influence [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2772.54s)]
*  apparatus laid out in that memo and now you look around and you see its elements operating [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2780.3s)]
*  in plain view. These days, more and more people sense a connection between the memo [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2786.54s)]
*  and everything that's happened since. The corporate takeover of American politics started with a man [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2791.82s)]
*  and a memo. If you want to know what the conservative movement has been doing [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2798.2200000000003s)]
*  for the past 40 years now, read the Powell memo. But as any prosecutor knows, to prove a conspiracy, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2802.54s)]
*  it's not enough to show that a group of people had a shared interest in a desired outcome [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2809.26s)]
*  or even that a plan existed. You have to also show that the players involved had an agreement [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2814.6200000000003s)]
*  and acted together to execute that plan. You see the behaviors begin to move as more and more [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2820.86s)]
*  corporate lobbying was set up as the front groups that the Powell memo foretold between corporations [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2828.0600000000004s)]
*  that don't want to have bad political conduct associated with their name but want to engage in [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2834.86s)]
*  bad political conduct needed and were set up. The actions after the memo follow too closely to the [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2840.38s)]
*  script to have it not have been read and been the template. Now, if Powell's manifesto really was [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2847.98s)]
*  put into action, the conspirators would have needed to have stuff like meetings, agendas, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2855.5s)]
*  and presentations, right? So where is all of that? Senator Whitehouse sees the connections, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2860.86s)]
*  but does he have hard evidence of a coordinated conspiracy? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2866.54s)]
*  I don't, but it's hard to believe that that wasn't circulated through the corporate community. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2871.5s)]
*  Well, guess what? We did what no one else has been able to do before. We found proof that there was [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2878.38s)]
*  a conspiracy and we found it in the darndest of places. So that's where we're going next. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Fo6rQQYATQ&t=2884.7799999999997s)]
