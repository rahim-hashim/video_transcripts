*  Now on to the episode.
*  The Lever.
*  This is one of my favorites.
*  This is attorney James Bopp.
*  He's showing me all the memorabilia of his career scattered around his wood paneled office.
*  There's a framed letter from Ronald Reagan.
*  There's a photo of him with Dick Cheney.
*  And yes, there's him on the cover of the American Bar Association's magazine, the ABA Journal,
*  with the headline, the big Bopper.
*  More campaign finance cases than anyone else in the country.
*  When we first reached out to Bopp for an interview, we figured we'd be heading to meet him at
*  some big fancy law office in Washington, D.C. or New York.
*  Instead, he told us to meet him at his storefront law office in Terre Haute, Indiana.
*  Terre Haute doesn't seem like a bustling hive of political intrigue and master planning.
*  Here on this sunny day in late winter, it had the look of lots of Midwest towns whose
*  boom days are long gone.
*  There's an ornate courthouse and some big buildings in a sparsely populated downtown.
*  It's basically the town from Parks and Rec in a red state dominated by Ron Swanson politics.
*  It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's
*  teat until they have sore chapped nipples.
*  Terre Haute is where Larry Bird played college basketball, where socialist presidential candidate
*  Eugene Debs was born, and where Timothy McVeigh was executed.
*  But there's a good argument to be made that the Terre Hauter, who's had the most significant
*  long-term impact on America, is this affable 76-year-old grandfather in a blue sweater
*  and khakis.
*  So the first obvious question I had for James Bopp was this.
*  Why does he live here, so far away from the political power brokers that he's trying to influence?
*  Well, I'm third generation Bopp in Terre Haute.
*  I stayed here because of the culture.
*  Married, had three daughters.
*  We wanted a relatively conservative cultural environment.
*  And even though Terre Haute at the time was two to one Democrat, culturally it was conservative.
*  Growing up, Bopp's family wasn't especially political.
*  But his dad did have some clearly defined views.
*  He was a doctor.
*  And he really did believe in the Hippocratic oath.
*  Physicians shall do no harm.
*  So he always thought abortion was unethical.
*  So I developed a lot of my conservative philosophy before I even got to high school.
*  Bopp was really clear with us about this point.
*  He's been an unabashed conservative for most of his life.
*  And way before he ever cared about campaign finance, he was conservative about abortion.
*  Just keep that in mind.
*  After college at Indiana University and law school in Florida, Bopp returned to Terre
*  Haute and worked a stint at the state attorney general's office before becoming the general
*  counsel for the National Right to Life Committee.
*  The mood is pride and achievement at this year's convention of the National Right to
*  Life Committee.
*  These anti-abortionists have successfully used sophisticated lobbying and public pressure
*  to chip away at the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal.
*  And they intend to stay on the attack.
*  The number of legal abortions continues to rise.
*  But pro-abortion leaders are worried nonetheless.
*  I think my greatest concern is that they will affect power at the congressional level that
*  is not in fact representative of the will of the people.
*  That pro-choice activists' fears were well founded.
*  Changing the political power equation was exactly what young James Bopp planned to do
*  at the National Right to Life Committee.
*  They did not have a pack.
*  And one of my first things I was interested in doing was getting National Right to Life
*  to create a pack because they needed to become more aggressively involved in political activity.
*  And one way to do that is to contribute to candidates.
*  But in 1980, when the National Right to Life Committee published voter guides encouraging
*  support for anti-choice candidates, the organization got in trouble for violating the old Federal
*  Election Campaign Act.
*  That's when Bopp realized that campaign finance restrictions were limiting his organization's
*  ability to achieve its one big goal.
*  To design and implement a strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade.
*  Increasingly, it seemed like the way to do that was to deregulate the campaign finance
*  system so that the anti-choice movement could get anti-choice politicians elected who would
*  then get anti-choice judges appointed to the bench.
*  So Bopp began knitting the two seemingly separate causes together, the fight against abortion
*  and the fight against campaign finance regulations.
*  And he appropriated his strategy from probably the last person I would have ever guessed.
*  The NAACP strategy implemented by Thurgood Marshall and Brown v. Board of Education.
*  I mean, what?
*  This hyper-conservative anti-choice activist lawyer was inspired by civil rights legend
*  Thurgood Marshall?
*  But it's true.
*  He was.
*  Bopp tore a page out of the NAACP's playbook.
*  He started filing campaign finance suits, a lot of them, over and over, and seeing what
*  took, what got accepted to higher courts, and which arguments worked to chip away at
*  campaign finance regulations.
*  And he kept his eye on the prize, the Supreme Court.
*  He familiarized himself with the justices, their ideologies, and their temperaments.
*  See, I can't make the Supreme Court do anything.
*  Anything.
*  They are in total control of the cases they accept, the issues they agree to decide, and
*  how they decide those issues.
*  But in order to persuade them to do something, they've got to take my case.
*  And the best case for them to agree to decide is one that gives them options.
*  And if they're willing, they can go big.
*  In this episode, the master planners go big.
*  Really big.
*  When we last left off, justices John Roberts and Sam Alito had just replaced Sandra Day
*  O'Connor and William Rehnquist on the Supreme Court.
*  Now, with that new court in the late 2000s, James Bopp saw an opportunity to destroy decades
*  of campaign finance laws in a single blow, using an obscure film about Hillary Clinton.
*  If you thought you knew everything about Hillary Clinton, wait till you see the movie.
*  But to win his case, Bopp needed to secure a vote from one of the most inscrutable and
*  powerful men in America, Justice Anthony Kennedy.
*  Justice Kennedy has really kind of held the keys to all of these major decisions.
*  And so there hasn't really been another swing vote like him.
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Master Plan.
*  Master Plan has been named a finalist in two categories of the prestigious Signal Awards.
*  Now we need you to go and vote for Master Plan to win.
*  Go to vote.signalaward.com and vote for Master Plan in the best writing and news and politics
*  categories right now.
*  Again that's vote.signalaward.com.
*  Thank you.
*  Young Anthony Kennedy's life started in the non-glitzy, non-LA part of California.
*  Like the fictional Hill Valley from Back to the Future, Sacramento in the mid-20th
*  century was bustling an all-white picket fancy.
*  But underneath the idyllic charm, Sacramento was also California's version of the swamp.
*  As the state capital, it was teeming with lobbyists and politicians and their dirty
*  money greasing deals over everything from oil and water to redevelopment and liquor.
*  I imagine the city's ethos was like that line in Chinatown.
*  Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they laugh slum enough.
*  Anthony Kennedy was born into this swampy culture.
*  His dad was a powerful lawyer and lobbyist who focused on the state legislature, running
*  a reliable business of influence peddling and soft corruption.
*  In 1963, his father died of a heart attack and young Anthony took over the firm.
*  He was only 27 years old.
*  As a lobbyist, Kennedy soon became known for handing out campaign money to legislators
*  on behalf of his clients.
*  He worked alongside Ed Meese, a master planner we've mentioned a few times before, who had
*  a close relationship with that B-movie actor from the Man Meets Monkey film, Bedtime for
*  Bonzo.
*  Even a monkey brought up in the right surroundings can learn the meaning of decency and honesty.
*  Of course, by the early 1970s, that same actor was the Arch-Conservative Governor of California,
*  Ronald Reagan.
*  And so while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was holding its secret meetings about implementing
*  the Powell Memo in 1973, the Chamber's California State branch was doing its part to put the
*  memo's ideology into action, backing Governor Reagan's major anti-tax ballot measure, which
*  it billed in Powell memo-esque terms as an economic bill of rights.
*  Who helped Reagan draft that ballot measure?
*  Anthony Kennedy.
*  It is the most revolutionary and complicated tax reform ever to be submitted to a vote
*  of the people.
*  Proposition 1 would cut state income taxes, making them a little smaller each year.
*  It would put a constitutional limit on state spending, allowing increases only as the total
*  personal taxable income in California rises.
*  The tax proposition ultimately failed by hundreds of thousands of votes, but Reagan
*  soon helped his pal Kennedy by getting President Gerald Ford to appoint him to a federal judgeship.
*  Kennedy was just 38 years old when he was appointed to the bench, making him the youngest
*  federal appellate judge in the country.
*  Right away, Kennedy forged a reputation as mild-mannered and polite.
*  Some might even say genteel.
*  He was a conservative, yes, but not necessarily a predictable or totally ideological one.
*  He had a reputation for supporting individual freedoms, read like a libertarian, and making
*  narrow decisions on a case-by-case basis, rather than issuing sweeping ideological rulings.
*  And he kept that up into the late 1980s, coming to be known as the leader of a conservative
*  minority on California's more liberal Ninth Circuit.
*  And then, in June 1987, journalist Bill Moyers asked the OG master planner, U.S. Supreme
*  Court Justice Lewis Powell, how much longer he would remain on the court.
*  You've been here now 15 years.
*  You're 80 years old.
*  Any thought about retiring?
*  My health has not been good.
*  I go to the Mayo Clinic with some frequency, but at the moment I have no present plans.
*  But then, literally the next day...
*  Good evening.
*  Justice Lewis Powell, a courtly Southerner, surprised almost everyone today by announcing
*  his retirement from the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  His decision touched off a flurry of speculation on who the president will appoint as a replacement
*  and how that will affect the direction of the court and, of course, the country.
*  That meant Anthony Kennedy's old pal from Sacramento, now President Ronald Reagan, suddenly had
*  a chance to nominate a new Supreme Court Justice.
*  Want to guess who Reagan first picked to fill Lewis Powell's seat?
*  Nope, not Anthony Kennedy.
*  Reagan first went for the A-lister of the master plan cinematic universe, the one, the
*  only Robert Bork.
*  Bork, Bork, Bork.
*  Yep, that's the same Robert Bork who did Nixon's dirty work and who helped Gerald Ford get
*  the Buckley v. Valeo ruling.
*  As you also heard a few episodes ago, when Reagan nominated the Rasputin-like Bork to
*  the Supreme Court, Senate Democrats fought back.
*  We told you that Bork got Borked, but we didn't tell you what happened next.
*  When Bork was voted down, Reagan's second choice was Douglas Ginsburg.
*  Ginsburg had led the Reagan White House's deregulation agenda.
*  He hobbled antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department, and he had just made an appearance
*  at a Federalist Society event.
*  I mean, he was no Robert Bork, but he was a pretty perfect master plan pick, right?
*  Well, almost.
*  Ginsburg was forced to withdraw from consideration in a very 1980s scandal.
*  Several conservative Republicans had urged President Reagan to withdraw Ginsburg nomination
*  after he disclosed he smoked marijuana in the 60s and 70s.
*  Listen, I remember this happening when I was a kid.
*  Who smoked weed and when was a huge deal back then.
*  So Ginsburg got Borked too.
*  Months after Powell's retirement, Reagan, just like Nixon in the early 1970s, was 0
*  for 2 in Supreme Court nominees.
*  And just like Nixon with Powell back then, Reagan now needed to find a jurist who was
*  conservative enough to get nominated, but who presented as liberal and reasonable enough
*  to get confirmed.
*  And so Reagan turned to his old Sacramento buddy, Anthony Kennedy.
*  Are you worried or upset that you are in effect the third choice for this seat?
*  I'm delighted with this nomination.
*  Mr. President, why didn't you nominate Judge Kennedy the first time?
*  I have told you that all three, we came down to a final three, and that all three were
*  so close and so well qualified that you could have almost thrown a dart by that decision.
*  Right away, Kennedy was seen as the nice guy alternative to the hard-edged Bork and the
*  pothead Ginsburg.
*  During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy's past career in Sacramento's influence peddling
*  industry wasn't seen as a liability at all.
*  In fact, Republican senators like Orrin Hatch seemed thrilled that Kennedy had experience
*  as both an attorney and a corporate lobbyist.
*  Here's Hatch at Kennedy's confirmation hearing.
*  Well, I see you as a person with your experience, both as an eminent lawyer, as a person who
*  has worked as a lobbyist, as a person who might have a great deal of ability on that
*  court to bring consensus about.
*  Democrats this time offered literally zero opposition to Reagan's Supreme Court nominee.
*  Kennedy was unanimously confirmed on February 3, 1988.
*  Judge and now Justice Kennedy.
*  Sounds good, doesn't it?
*  Takes a distinguished seat on the high bench.
*  At Kennedy's swearing-in ceremony, Reagan made sure to draw parallels between Kennedy
*  and the man he was replacing on the bench.
*  One of the great gentlemen of the American judiciary, a justice widely acclaimed for
*  his decency and fairness, Justice Lewis Powell.
*  Like his distinguished predecessor, Justice...
*  That may have sounded placating to liberals, but in retrospect, it must have been reassuring
*  to the master planners.
*  Upon joining the court, Kennedy started to build a moderate profile on social issues.
*  Notably, in 1992, he co-authored an opinion that reaffirmed Roe v. Wade.
*  But he also opted to uphold some abortion restrictions.
*  Meanwhile, for those paying close attention, Anthony Kennedy, the former corporate lobbyist,
*  also started dog whistling to the master planners about corruption and campaign finance.
*  He voted against and wrote the dissent in a 1990 case that upheld the state law preventing
*  corporations from using their funds to support political campaigns.
*  He voted to let political parties make unlimited expenditures to buy elections for their congressional
*  candidates as long as they didn't directly coordinate with those candidates.
*  And Kennedy voted against upholding certain provisions of the McCain-Feingold campaign
*  finance law in that case you heard about in episode 6.
*  But mostly for his first 17 years on the court, Kennedy was kind of a backbencher.
*  You just didn't hear a ton about him.
*  That all changed, though, when Sandra Day O'Connor and William Rehnquist were replaced
*  by John Roberts and Sam Alito.
*  All of a sudden, Anthony Kennedy became one of the most powerful men in America, able
*  to instantly shift national policy on any issue that came before the high court.
*  With four liberal justices and four conservatives on the Supreme Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy's
*  swing vote will be key.
*  A moderate conservative whose votes on high-stakes cases are close to impossible to predict.
*  He's the man in the middle, the right-leaning justice who often swings left on some of the
*  most hot-button cases.
*  After the Roberts-Alito Supreme Court takeover, Kennedy's rulings with liberal justices on
*  LGBTQ issues, habeas corpus, abortion rights, they probably made it seem like he'd keep
*  the court from going too far to the right.
*  But conservatives knew that Kennedy's vote could be swung, so they began lining up to
*  throw all kinds of cases at him and the new conservative majority on the court, like kids
*  lining up to see Santa Claus.
*  But as they say in Christmas Story, the line waiting to see Santa Claus stretched all the
*  way back to Terre Haute.
*  Back at his storefront office in Terre Haute, Indiana, James Bopp had his eye on deregulating
*  the campaign finance system, a cause that Kennedy seemed especially amenable to.
*  So Bopp elbowed his way to the front of the queue with a case that brought his two pet
*  causes together, the crusade against abortion and the crusade to deregulate campaign finance
*  laws.
*  But I can't tell the story without talking about the Wisconsin Act of Law.
*  James Bopp saw a new chance to try to go big.
*  It was absolutely critical.
*  Bopp is talking about FEC v. Wisconsin Right to Life, a Supreme Court case that was heard
*  right after John Roberts and Sam Alito were installed, right when Anthony Kennedy was
*  the new swing vote.
*  Wisconsin Right to Life contacts me and says that there's an upcoming vote on Bush's judicial
*  Fine Gold of McCain Fine Gold fame is up for election and we want to lobby him and the
*  vote's going to be in September.
*  The special interest anti-abortion group Wisconsin Right to Life is now airing this TV spot.
*  There are a lot of judicial nominees out there who can't go to work.
*  But come this weekend, this ad and corresponding radio hits will be illegal.
*  Why?
*  Because who Wisconsin Right to Life or WRTL talks about in its ad?
*  Contact Senators Fine Gold and Cole and tell them to oppose the filibuster.
*  Those Wisconsin Right to Life ads fell within the 60-day window or blackout period before
*  that year's general election, which made it subject to the restrictions of the McCain
*  Fine Gold campaign finance law, which, as you heard before, had been upheld by the pre-Roberts,
*  pre-Alito Supreme Court.
*  Under that law, the group couldn't mention Senator Fine Gold by name because that would
*  be considered electioneering.
*  So Bopp sued on the grounds that those restrictions were a violation of free speech.
*  On April 25, 2007, James Bopp argued that case in front of the Roberts and Alito Supreme
*  Court.
*  The questioning focused on whether the Wisconsin Right to Life ads were just issue ads designed
*  to lobby or whether they were a stealthy form of electioneering against the candidate
*  in the election.
*  Here's Justice Stevens questioning Bopp about the distinction.
*  Are you trying to convince us the purpose of these ads was to convince Senator Fine
*  Gold to change his position on filibusters?
*  It was indeed.
*  It was to lobby him about the upcoming vote.
*  Did you think that was a realistic goal?
*  Yes, as it turns out, because in 2006 we ran the same sort of anti-filibuster ads,
*  and Senator Cole, now up for re-election, changed his position on the filibuster.
*  So these things happen.
*  In other words, people's positions are affected by grassroots lobbying, and at least
*  people should have the opportunity to do grassroots lobbying.
*  Is that called democracy?
*  Sorry.
*  We are hopeful, Your Honor.
*  Ultimately, the conservative majority on the court, including the key swing vote, Anthony
*  Kennedy, narrowly agreed with Bopp, saying that Wisconsin Right to Life's ads were not
*  express political advocacy since they didn't literally tell people whether or not to vote
*  for specific candidates.
*  The court declared that Wisconsin Right to Life's ads could not be regulated by the McCain
*  Feingold campaign finance law.
*  Here's Chief Justice John Roberts, once again play-acting as a baseball umpire.
*  Discussion of issues cannot be suppressed simply because the issues may also be pertinent
*  in an election.
*  Where the First Amendment is implicated, the tie goes to the speaker, not the censor.
*  Put another way, a mere four years after the old Rehnquist Court dunked on the master planners
*  and upheld McCain's campaign finance law, the new Roberts Court had just sided with
*  those same master planners and overturned a major part of that law.
*  This was an empire strikes back moment for the ages.
*  I call that the magic words case.
*  This is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse.
*  Whitehouse first took his seat as the junior senator from Rhode Island just six months
*  before the decision in FEC versus Wisconsin Right to Life came down.
*  He told us just how significant this little-noticed case really was.
*  That was the case in which Supreme Court decided what the magic words were, that if you used
*  them in an ad, it became a political ad and was subject to a variety of regulations and
*  limitations.
*  But if you didn't use those magic words, then you could say that your ad was not a political
*  ad but it was issue advocacy.
*  You weren't recommending a vote against Senator Whitehouse.
*  You were just recommending that voters call up Senator Whitehouse and ask why he was a
*  thieving, dirty, puppy-hating, anti-American scoundrel.
*  The effect on the airwaves is the same, but if you didn't use the magic words about vote
*  or elect, then this whole new avenue opened up for dirty political TV advertising.
*  Whitehouse said that the little magic words loophole started opening up the floodgates
*  for unregulated, anonymous, dark money ads that buy elections, all under the guise of
*  educating the public with so-called issue ads rather than electioneering.
*  I think that was the purpose of the exercise.
*  Here are the words that if you don't use them, you're good to go on election spending.
*  So you can see why James Bopp told us that the decision in FEC v. Wisconsin Right to
*  Life was absolutely critical.
*  It was a huge blow to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.
*  But perhaps more importantly, it showed Bopp how this new Roberts Alito Court was inclined
*  to rule on all of these campaign finance issues.
*  Bopp also noticed something else.
*  March Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia wrote a concurrence agreeing with the court's
*  decision but saying it should have gone a step further and completely eliminated McCain-Feingold's
*  prohibitions against unlimited corporate spending to sway elections.
*  The concurrence was backed by Clarence Thomas, hardly a surprise.
*  But there was a third signature on the document.
*  You guessed it, Anthony Kennedy.
*  That was a signal to James Bopp that perhaps he could get Kennedy, the old Sacramento swamp
*  thing, to channel his predecessor Lewis Powell and go huge.
*  This season on The Catch, we're going global.
*  We'll hear about a lobster fishery in Maine, the impact of sand dredging in Indonesia,
*  the balance that's being struck between fishers, tourist operators and environmentalists in
*  the Galapagos and the tensions over expanding South Africa's marine protected areas.
*  I'm Brooks Sandra Guiri.
*  Join me for season four of The Catch, a show from Foreign Policy about the seafood we eat
*  and the impact it can have on our world.
*  The past is shrouded in mystery.
*  To understand it, you have to get up close.
*  What happened to our collective psyche after the atom bomb?
*  On NPR's Throughline, we reopen stories from the past to find clues to the present.
*  Find Throughline wherever you get your podcasts.
*  I announced today that I'm forming a presidential exploratory committee.
*  I'm not just starting a campaign, though.
*  I'm beginning a conversation with you, with America.
*  It's early 2007.
*  Hillary Clinton has announced her campaign for president.
*  James Bopp is in Terre Haute working on arguments that might get justices to go big in that
*  Wisconsin right to life case.
*  So let the conversation begin.
*  I have a feeling it's going to be very interesting.
*  And then one day, James Bopp's phone rings.
*  So I'm sitting in my office and I get a phone call from David Bossie.
*  David Bossie is a conservative activist.
*  In 1992, he was working for a nonprofit that was first founded by the same people who made
*  one of the sleaziest dark money ads in American history, the Willie Horton ad that shifted
*  the 1988 presidential election that you heard about in episode six.
*  By 2000, Bossie was the organization's president.
*  So James Bopp picks up the phone to talk to David Bossie.
*  And Bossie asks Bopp if he'd represent his organization in a juicy lawsuit about Hillary
*  Clinton that could end up letting corporations spend unlimited amounts of money in politics.
*  Oh, baby, you know what I like.
*  James Bopp likes big campaign finance cases, and this one might be the biggest of them all.
*  And he said, I'm working on a movie called Hillary the Movie.
*  All right.
*  And this is now early in 2007.
*  I'm working on a movie.
*  She's running for president.
*  Hillary the Movie was promoted by Bossie as a documentary, but it was functionally just
*  a hyper conservative 90 minute anti-Clinton campaign ad with sad, scary music, all funded
*  by a boatload of anonymous money.
*  She's deceitful.
*  She'll make up any story, lie about anything, as long as it serves her purpose of the moment.
*  And the American people are going to catch on to it.
*  I can't think of any other politician in history who has shown such a disrespect and a contempt
*  for the Constitution and the rule of law as Hillary.
*  So Bossie was calling Bopp to figure out how to drop this thing into the 2008 election
*  cycle while skirting campaign finance laws that apply to political ads during elections.
*  I want to broadcast this movie and I need your help two ways.
*  Okay.
*  First way is to make sure that our movie script does not have an appeal to vote for or against
*  a candidate because I want to be able to do this.
*  And if it has an appeal to vote, I'm prohibited.
*  So I want you to give me the advice to make sure that they could still do this movie.
*  The second thing Bossie wanted Bob's help on was finding a legal way to get around the
*  requirement to file a disclosure report about who exactly was funding the project.
*  The report would have required him to reveal his donors and people would not want to contribute
*  if they are going to be outed as funding an anti-Hillary, certainly critical of the Hillary
*  movie.
*  Right.
*  So he doesn't want to have to do this report of their donors.
*  This is something we've seen over and over again in our reporting.
*  Critics want to be able to broadcast whatever messages they want, but they don't want to
*  have to admit who is actually funding the message.
*  And this quote unquote movie was pretty nasty.
*  I knew Richard Nixon and I'll tell you something, she's no Richard Nixon, she's worse.
*  Ruthless.
*  Vendictive.
*  Venal.
*  Sneaky.
*  Ideological.
*  Intolerant.
*  Liar is a good one.
*  Scares the hell out of me.
*  So Bob took the lessons he learned in the Wisconsin case and he set about strategically
*  assembling this new case using arguments that Roberts and Scalia and Kennedy had signaled
*  they were sympathetic to.
*  And just like his inspiration Thurgood Marshall in Brown v. Board of Education, James Bob
*  hoped this case would be the big one.
*  Bossy's organization had run into issues with federal election regulators in the past.
*  They tried to make some so-called documentaries before, but the Dark Money Group was clearly
*  a political organization and not a movie studio.
*  So more than once, the Federal Election Commission insisted that they were subject to McCain
*  Feingold's restrictions.
*  Bob anticipated a similar pushback on Hillary the movie.
*  But rather than waiting for federal election regulators to send a cease and desist letter
*  to Bossy, Bob had a genius idea.
*  He went to a lower court demanding a declaratory judgment up front, one that would officially
*  allow Bossy to air his documentary right up until the 2008 primaries.
*  In other words, Bob took a play out of the Powell memo and used this case as a preemptive
*  attack.
*  The greatest care should be exercised in selecting the cases in which to participate.
*  He used this obscure movie to create a case out of thin air.
*  The lower court said essentially no.
*  Campaign finance restrictions obviously apply to this.
*  But that ruling gave Bob what he really wanted, a way to appeal the case up to John Roberts,
*  Sam Alito, and Anthony Kennedy on the Supreme Court.
*  When Hillary the movie became a legal case, it ended up being named after Bossy's non-movie
*  studio nonprofit.
*  Maybe you've heard of it.
*  The Citizens United case.
*  Citizens United.
*  Citizens United.
*  Get rid of Citizens United and its pernicious effects on our electoral system.
*  Citizens United was appealed up to the Supreme Court in August of 2008.
*  Hillary Clinton was long gone from the presidential race, defeated by Barack Obama.
*  But that didn't matter.
*  The master planners were after something much bigger.
*  The court agreed to hear the case three months later.
*  And then David Bossy replaced James Bob.
*  Bossy bumped Bob for a new hotshot attorney named Ted Olson.
*  By 2008, Olson was already famous in master plan circles.
*  He'd been a founding member of the Federalist Society and the Bush campaign's mouthpiece
*  at the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 election.
*  Supposedly, David Bossy had seen Olson win a Republican Lawyer of the Year award at an
*  event in Washington, D.C. in October 2008, where another attorney called Olson the, quote,
*  winningest Supreme Court lawyer.
*  So when Bossy's challenge was accepted at the high court the following month, he told
*  his co-founder that they should ditch old James Bob and Tara Hote and pick up Olson
*  instead, like leaving prom with the popular girl.
*  When Olson took over the Citizens United case, he slightly reformulated Bob's argument.
*  He focused on the idea that Hillary the movie was not what the McCain-Feingold campaign
*  finance law was actually supposed to prohibit.
*  It was a documentary movie that viewers had to seek out on video on demand, not a screeching
*  election ad that couldn't be avoided on cable TV.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, participation in the political process is
*  the First Amendment's most fundamental guarantee.
*  Yet that freedom is being smothered by one of the most complicated, expensive, and incomprehensible
*  regulatory regimes ever invented by the administrative state.
*  It was Olson who first brought up the word corruption.
*  The government cannot prove and has not attempted to prove that a 90-minute documentary poses
*  any threat of quid pro quo corruption or its appearance.
*  Indeed, this documentary is the very definition of robust, uninhibited debate about a subject
*  of intense political interest that the First Amendment is there to guarantee.
*  Olson argued with a straight face that Hillary the movie wasn't an election-focused ad governed
*  by campaign finance laws, despite the fact that it was dropped in the middle of an election
*  and spends 90 minutes insisting that Hillary Clinton was unqualified for the presidency
*  and was, I'm paraphrasing here, basically the Antichrist.
*  Justice Souter, for one, wasn't buying it.
*  Doesn't this one fall into campaign advocacy?
*  I mean, I've got the government's brief open at pages 18 and 19 with the quotations,
*  she'll lie about anything, she's deceitful, she's ruthless, cunning, dishonest, do anything
*  for power, will speak dishonestly, reckless, a congenital liar, sorely lacking in qualifications,
*  not qualified as commander in chief.
*  I mean, this sounds to me like campaign advocacy.
*  Yeah, you think?
*  In response, the master planners on the Supreme Court pretty much hijacked the oral arguments
*  the same way your crotchety uncle pulls the well-actually move to steer the Thanksgiving
*  dinner conversation towards his bizarre theories.
*  For example, instead of a discussion about money, influence, election buying, and corruption,
*  what the case was actually about, Justice Sam Alito forced the government's defense
*  lawyer into an absurd debate about book banning.
*  Here's Kennedy.
*  Suppose that we're an advocacy organization that had a book.
*  Your position is that under the Constitution, the advertising for this book or the sale
*  for the book itself could be prohibited within the 60, the 30-day period.
*  If the book contained the functional equivalent of express advocacy, that is, if it was subject
*  to no reasonable interpretation...
*  They proceeded to get into an even more ludicrous debate about e-books that are accessed via
*  satellite.
*  Within the 60, 30-day period, if it comes from a satellite, it can be prohibited under
*  the Constitution and perhaps under the statute.
*  I mean, this is a case about a movie.
*  What are they even talking about?
*  I feel like I'm Steve Martin in planes, trains, and automobiles.
*  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea.
*  Have a point.
*  It makes it so much more interesting for the listener.
*  The FEC's lawyer tried to steer the justices back on track.
*  It can't be prohibited, but a corporation could be barred from using its general treasury
*  funds to publish the book.
*  It could be required to raise funds to publish the book using its pack.
*  That was the actual point.
*  And unfortunately, the FEC's lawyer didn't make it very well.
*  It wasn't really about whether the government could or would prohibit the publication of
*  a book that urged its readers to vote or not vote for a specific candidate.
*  It was about a corporation being able to anonymously funnel money from its coffers into election
*  communications with no restrictions.
*  And the government was arguing that they'd have to use a regulated pack or explicitly
*  disclosed political money instead.
*  It's worth reiterating that none of this is what the original case was asking about.
*  But as the ever more twisted and deranged arguments went on, the conservative justices
*  like Anthony Kennedy kept insisting that it was a free speech question, even though it
*  really wasn't.
*  Then an hour later, it was over.
*  Thank you, counsel.
*  The case is submitted.
*  What happens behind the scenes when the justices vote on this case is kind of my favorite part
*  of the story.
*  Let's hear from the producer, Ula Kulpa, to tell us about when things got really interesting.
*  So after oral argument, the justices meet in private and have a round of initial votes
*  on the case.
*  It falls basically along ideological lines, with the four liberals against Citizens United
*  and the five conservatives, including Anthony Kennedy, in favor of saying that McCain Feingold,
*  Bicra, did not apply to Hillary the movie.
*  Roberts gets to work on a narrow opinion saying that, but Kennedy writes a concurrence that
*  argues that they should go way bigger and invalidate any campaign finance restrictions
*  on allegedly independent political groups like Citizens United.
*  So Roberts and the other conservatives then compare drafts.
*  And they love Kennedy's idea so much that Roberts withdraws his more narrow opinion
*  and lets Kennedy write the majority.
*  Exactly.
*  And this is where the drama hits.
*  After Justice Souter sees what Roberts and Kennedy are planning to do, he gets pissed
*  and writes a dissent.
*  And it has become infamous in legal circles because it was this full tilt, bridge-burning
*  attack on the logic of his fellow justices, which is something that almost never happens
*  and definitely not like this.
*  Reportedly, Souter berated not only the conclusions that Roberts and Kennedy had come to, but
*  the like, intellectual depravity to step outside of and way beyond what this case was asking
*  in the first place.
*  Finally, someone was calling bullshit.
*  Okay, so read us some excerpts.
*  Well, I can't.
*  Wait, why?
*  Because very few people have actually ever seen Souter's dissent.
*  And that's because not long after he drafted it,
*  Justice David Souter has informed the White House he will retire at the end of a Supreme
*  Court term in June.
*  God, it's exactly like that scene from Half Baked.
*  Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.
*  You're cool.
*  And fuck you, I'm out.
*  Totally.
*  And then, John Roberts basically makes sure Souter's dissent never gets published as part
*  of the official record.
*  Because instead of the ruling coming out at the end of the court's term, like you might
*  expect, Citizens United is suddenly scheduled for re-argument in the fall.
*  What the hell is re-argument?
*  It's when the court asks the lawyers to write all-new briefs about all-new questions.
*  In this case, Roberts asked them to address big constitutional questions that signaled
*  that the court wasn't going to issue a narrow ruling about one movie.
*  It was going to follow Kennedy's lead and go really, really big.
*  So here we are in the fall of 2009.
*  Things still seem all hopey and changey over in the White House, but only a few blocks
*  away at the Supreme Court, shit is about to go down.
*  The master planners had taken over the court with Roberts and Alito.
*  James Bopp had given Anthony Kennedy the chance to go big.
*  And Roberts figures out a way to make it all happen.
*  This is like the master planners A-Team moment.
*  I love it when a plan comes together.
*  So six months after the first argument in the Citizens United case, David Souter is
*  retired.
*  His barn-burning warning about the end of democracy is nowhere to be found.
*  The ideological terminator, John Roberts, rewinds the clock and lets Federalist Society
*  luminary Ted Olson make a whole new argument to the court.
*  He's not equal enough to the members of the society.
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court.
*  This was no longer a little argument about a specific campaign finance law and a dumb
*  documentary.
*  Robust debate about candidates for elective office is the most fundamental value protected
*  by the First Amendment's guarantee of free speech.
*  Olson and his client, Citizens United, were now resurrecting the old free speech arguments
*  from Buckley v. Valeo and from Lewis Powell's Bolotty ruling that you heard about in episode
*  five.
*  Essentially, they argued that money is protected speech.
*  They also argued that corporations therefore have a constitutional right to spend unlimited
*  money in elections as long as it's not directly coordinated by candidates and that such independent
*  spending isn't a corrupting force.
*  The justices seemed supportive of that view.
*  John McCain said they seemed totally out of touch with reality.
*  I was rather disappointed in some of the justices' apparent naivete as to how corporate and union
*  and unlimited money affects the legislative process.
*  Does anyone believe that the rights of average citizens to be heard in Washington would not
*  be overridden by massive campaign unlimited campaign contributions from corporations and
*  unions?
*  McCain was correct.
*  Nobody believed that.
*  If that was a feature of the Citizens United case, not a bug.
*  A ruling in favor of Citizens United would override average citizens' voices and create
*  a society run by corporations and oligarchs, just as James Bopp's fellow Hoosier, Ron
*  Swanson, had dreamed of back in fictional small town Indiana.
*  I think that all government is a waste of taxpayer money.
*  My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit by corporations
*  like Chuck E. Cheese.
*  They have an impeccable business model.
*  I would rather work for Chuck E. Cheese.
*  McCain, Feingold, and all the reformers warned that ruling for Citizens United would deregulate
*  the campaign finance system and basically make Ron Swanson's vision a reality.
*  Politicians and public officials would work for Chuck E. Cheese and every other corporation,
*  and those corporations would be allowed to buy elections.
*  I mean, the Supreme Court was pretty radical, but would it really go that far?
*  That's after the break.
*  The 2024 election means this year is going to be chock full of drama and nail biting
*  suspense.

*  In case 08205, Citizens United versus the FEC, Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the
*  court.
*  On January 21, 2010, just over four months after the second round of arguments, the decision
*  in Citizens United came down.
*  This time, it wasn't Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion.
*  It was the old Sacramento swamp thing.
*  Former lobbyist and influence peddler Anthony Kennedy.
*  In announcing the decision to the public, Kennedy first laid out why the majority had
*  decided to go big.
*  He identified the precedents that were relevant to the case, like the court's ruling a few
*  years prior that had held up the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law.
*  And then he said,
*  We conclude that those precedents now must be reexamined.
*  The court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations.
*  If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing
*  citizens or associations of citizens for simply engaging in political speech.
*  The precedents the court's majority was now dismantling, according to Kennedy,
*  Would allow the government to ban corporations from expressing political views through any
*  media, including media beyond those presented here and in this case, such as by printing
*  books.
*  Political speech is indispensable to decision making in a democracy.
*  And this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than an individual.
*  This is the radical corporations or people concept on steroids.
*  And the opinion was directly built from that Baladi ruling first authored by Kennedy's
*  immediate predecessor, Lewis Powell.
*  Even more radical, Anthony Kennedy, who spent his early years as a lobbyist, doling out
*  campaign cash to sway legislators.
*  That same Anthony Kennedy was now also insisting that money in politics was only corrupting
*  when there was an explicit quid pro quo.
*  But all the other things that Anthony Kennedy himself had helped his Sacramento lobbying
*  clients use money to buy, stuff like access and influence, that stuff was apparently not corrupting.
*  That sounds like an exaggeration, but in his written opinion, Kennedy asserted that campaign
*  donors, quote, may have influence over or access to elected officials.
*  But that did not, quote, mean that these officials are corrupt.
*  And then Kennedy wrote something so crazy that hold on, hold on, can I get a special
*  effect on my voice for this so that it sounds extra evil?
*  Okay, there we go.
*  Kennedy said, quote, independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not
*  give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption.
*  I mean, think about how insane that is.
*  Anthony Kennedy non-ironically wrote a ruling with the force of law that essentially declares
*  that when a corporation spends $50 million blanketing your state to help one candidate
*  win a U.S. Senate election, there's no corruption or even appearance of corruption when that
*  candidate then does legislative favors for that corporation.
*  Justice Stevens wrote the dissent on behalf of the liberals.
*  It may not have been Souter's barn burner, but it was pretty close.
*  It was 90 pages long and probably bolstered by the fact that Stevens was 90 years old
*  and also nearly ready to retire.
*  As one of the joint authors of the opinion in McConnell, I must emphatically disagree
*  with today's law-changing decision.
*  Stevens' dissent made the point that up until O'Connor and Rehnquist were replaced by Roberts
*  and Alito, the court had upheld at least some restrictions on corporate spending in elections.
*  The court has the point exactly backwards.
*  At the founding, Americans took it as a given that corporations could be comprehensively
*  regulated in the service of the public welfare.
*  It is doubtful that the framers believed the freedom of speech would extend to corporations
*  who cannot themselves engage in speech.
*  And it is even more doubtful that when they ratified the First Amendment, they thought
*  they were laying down a principle that could be used to insulate corporations from even
*  modest restrictions on electioneering expenditures.
*  After speaking for 20 minutes, twice as long as Kennedy had, Stevens had his mic drop moment.
*  While American democracy is still imperfect, few outside the majority of this court would
*  have thought its flaws included a shortage of corporate money in politics.
*  Unsurprisingly, when the ruling came down, David Bossie of Citizens United was giddy.
*  This is a monumental day for Citizens United and more importantly for the First Amendment
*  and the fundamental rights of people to participate in the political process and the marketplace
*  of ideas.
*  Whether you're an individual, whether you're a corporation or a union, it doesn't matter.
*  You can now participate fully and freely in the election process.
*  Here's Senator Sheldon Whitehouse again.
*  My recollection is that I was on the Senate floor and came back to read the decision.
*  He said the decision was painful to read.
*  I live in the immediate political world and I was watching the Supreme Court buy into
*  a notion about that political world that I knew to be false.
*  They have applied a conceptual paradigm over politics that is complete and utter nonsense.
*  While much of the country reacted to the decision with surprise and anger, Whitehouse says
*  that conservative must have had an inkling that this was coming.
*  Because right after the decision came down, conservative and business interest groups
*  immediately filed papers to create scores of unregulated dark money groups that could
*  exploit the ruling.
*  The fact that they had this whole 501c4 apparatus ready to go sort of proved that this was an
*  expected decision.
*  In fact, you even have Virginia Thomas setting up her organization while the decision is
*  being deliberated so that on the day it's announced, she's ready to go.
*  Whitehouse is referring to Virginia Ginny Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas.
*  Just weeks before the ruling in Citizens United came down, she and Leonard Leo of the Federalist
*  Society filed initial paperwork for a not-for-profit lobbying group called Liberty Central, a
*  group designed to take advantage of the Citizens United ruling.
*  Liberty Central is America's public square.
*  We inspire, we listen, we activate ordinary citizens to secure the blessings of liberty.
*  Though it was hidden at the time, later reporting revealed that Liberty Central's initial $500,000
*  of funding came from, who else, the Thomas's favorite billionaire, a guy named Harlan Crow,
*  who'd been funding lavish trips for Justice Thomas.
*  On the other side of the aisle, Democrats openly criticized the Citizens United ruling.
*  Here's President Obama in his State of the Union address less than a week after the decision.
*  Last week the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates
*  for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.
*  In the video of the speech, you can see the justices stay seated and look stone-faced
*  as much of the room stands to applaud Obama around them.
*  And then there's Samuel Alito shaking his head and muttering, not true.
*  It made me grieve for Sandra Day O'Connor, whose departure had opened the door for Alito
*  particularly and whose common sense and experience as somebody who had run for office, I think,
*  would have headed off Citizens United had she stayed on the court.
*  So the whole thing was just sort of imbued with sorrow and missed chances.
*  But the result at the end was a completely manufactured simulacrum of what the political
*  world is like created by the court and imposed on all of us.
*  White House and John McCain tried to quickly limit the ruling's effects.
*  They asked the Supreme Court to at least prevent a lower court in Montana from now using Citizens
*  United to gut that state's 100-year-old anti-corruption law.
*  The Supreme Court refused to even hear the case.
*  So at that point, I realized, oh my God, this is not an innocent mistake.
*  They are actually deliberately trying to open our political world to right-wing political
*  dark money.
*  In my imagination, James Bopp was celebrating back home in Indiana when he read the Citizens
*  United ruling.
*  Great job, everyone.
*  The reception will be held in each of our individual houses alone.
*  But alas, James Bopp wasn't there.
*  He was actually on the beach.
*  I don't even remember why I was in Florida, but I remember very distinctly reading the
*  opinion on the beach in Florida.
*  Of course, I knew the decision that they'd overturn the two precedents that needed to
*  be overturned.
*  And I knew the vote.
*  He was psyched.
*  But if he doesn't sound 100% excited about the ruling, it's because he kind of wasn't.
*  Sure, he had gotten most of what he wanted.
*  He had created a case that convinced the court to go huge and eviscerate campaign finance
*  laws in a world-changing ruling.
*  Over years before Citizens United, nonprofits and other non-disclosing political groups
*  had spent zero dollars in the 2006 election cycle.
*  In 2010, right after the ruling, those groups accounted for 47% of political spending, $134
*  million.
*  But still, there was one part of the Citizens United ruling that stuck in James Bopp's
*  They upheld a report.
*  The disclosure.
*  Yeah, the disclosure report.
*  Remember, David Bossie originally asked Bopp to help his group circumvent the McCain-Feingold
*  law and let Citizens United air its glorified anti-Hillary campaign ad in the middle of
*  the election.
*  But Bossie also told Bopp he wanted to ignore the McCain-Feingold law's disclosure provisions
*  and hide the names of the ad's funders from the public.
*  On that disclosure issue, the court actually ruled against Citizens United.
*  The court ruled that laws requiring big spenders in elections and politics to be disclosed,
*  those laws were constitutional.
*  We reject Citizens United's challenge to the disclaimer and disclosure provisions.
*  Those mechanisms provide information to the electorate.
*  The resulting transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper
*  weight to different speakers and different messages.
*  When he heard this caveat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse saw an opportunity to call the
*  Supreme Court's bluff.
*  He introduced a bill called the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending
*  in Elections Act, a hilariously wordy attempt to get a pithy acronym, the Disclose Act.
*  The Disclose Act was originally designed to require that you trace back to the actual
*  source of political contributions for any contribution to a political campaign or a
*  PAC or a super PAC over $10,000 in an individual race.
*  That's not a whole lot of people, but at that level you really are buying influence and
*  so I think it's important for voters to understand what's going on in their political world around them.
*  Democrats rallied behind the Disclose Act right away, while Republicans, like Mitch
*  McConnell, contorted themselves to swat it down.
*  This Disclose Act is not about reform.
*  It's nothing more than Democrats sitting behind closed doors with special interest lobbyists
*  choosing which favored groups they want to speak in the 2010 elections.
*  But McConnell and the other master planners were not satisfied just stopping the Disclose
*  Act in the Senate and walking off into the sunset with the Citizens United ruling.
*  If your movement's half century goal is to completely deregulate the campaign finance
*  system and legalize the buying of elections so that a handful of anonymous big spenders
*  could completely control politics, what more could you possibly want after Citizens United?
*  Well, one answer to that question is something that was baked into the Citizens United case
*  by the master planner's favorite justice of all.
*  The guy that we now know was being secretly wined and dined by billionaires, Clarence Thomas.
*  In a concurrence that almost nobody noticed, Thomas voted for the ruling but said he thought
*  it didn't go far enough.
*  He said, wait, wait, hang on, can I get that evil voice special effect one more time?
*  He wrote, quote, this court should invalidate mandatory disclosure and reporting requirements.
*  So if you're a master planner, maybe after Citizens United, you want to try to do that,
*  kill off all disclosure.
*  And maybe you also want to hobble the last remaining campaign finance regulators on the
*  beat.
*  And maybe, just maybe, you want to try to get the government to declare that cash for
*  favors like actual money for actual political favors is now completely legal.
*  In the day's other news, the U.S. Supreme Court lent a seemingly sympathetic ear to
*  former Virginia Governor Bob McDonnell.
*  He faces two years in prison for accepting thousands of dollars in gifts and loans from
*  a businessman.
*  But in today's arguments, both liberal and conservative justices suggested the federal
*  bribery law is overboard.
