# Episode 2: The Other Watergate | Master Plan
**The Master Plan:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o)
*  People of consequence are questioned on the issues of our time by Elizabeth Drew on 30 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=0.0s)]
*  Minutes With. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=10.86s)]
*  It was September 7th, 1972, about seven months after President Richard Nixon had signed the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=11.86s)]
*  Federal Election Campaign Act. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=17.56s)]
*  30 Minutes With was a weekly public affairs program that broadcast on a newfangled TV [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=19.96s)]
*  network called PBS. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=25.16s)]
*  Tonight, John D. Ehrlichman. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=27.16s)]
*  Mr. Ehrlichman, as the top assistant to the president for domestic affairs, I'd like to [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=29.8s)]
*  ask you some questions beginning with what the Nixon administration might do if it's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=35.2s)]
*  re-elected and has four more years in office. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=40.08s)]
*  The host, Elizabeth Drew, was a Washington correspondent for the Atlantic Monthly. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=42.64s)]
*  Her bouffant hairdo and bright green blouse created a stark contrast to the man in the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=47.44s)]
*  dark suit sitting across from her. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=52.28s)]
*  Like all political journalists, Drew had been closely following the various scandals and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=54.68s)]
*  questionable activities cropping up around President Nixon in the months since he had [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=59.76s)]
*  signed the nation's first major anti-corruption legislation in decades. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=64.44s)]
*  You gave an interview to the Christian Science Monitor earlier this year and you said that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=69.62s)]
*  in his campaign the president was going to be able to point with pride to having quote [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=73.92s)]
*  gotten Washington away from the Bobby Baker syndrome. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=78.0s)]
*  Bobby Baker was Lyndon Johnson's top senadate who had to resign in 1963 in a bribery scandal. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=80.96s)]
*  Drew is basically asking if Nixon kept his promise to drain the swamp. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=87.44s)]
*  There have been various controversies now around this administration, the break in of [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=92.67999999999999s)]
*  the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=96.52s)]
*  Do these things keep the president from pointing with pride to this sort of thing in the campaign? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=99.36s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=103.72s)]
*  As far as the Watergate thing is concerned, I know just about as much about it as you [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=104.72s)]
*  do probably less, except I do know very definitely that people in the government, in the White [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=108.96s)]
*  House particularly, are simply not involved in that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=115.1s)]
*  Yeah, you heard that right. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=117.88s)]
*  No involvement with Watergate according to John Ehrlichman. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  The Nixon aide who America would soon learn was literally the man who oversaw Watergate. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  But here we are just months before the 1972 election and Ehrlichman is appearing on television [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=129.42s)]
*  to portray the Nixon administration as good government reformers, an argument bolstered [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=135.54s)]
*  by Nixon having recently signed the campaign finance reform bill. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=141.66s)]
*  And I think after the history of this first term is written and you look back, you're [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=145.7s)]
*  going to see that compared to other administrations or by any standard you'd want to apply, that [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=149.62s)]
*  it has been an extraordinarily clean, corruption-free administration because the president insists [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=155.1s)]
*  on it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=160.89999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly what I think of when I think of the Nixon administration. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=161.89999999999998s)]
*  Clean and corruption-free. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=165.42s)]
*  Ehrlichman here is trying to whitewash the White House in a performance that goes way [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=167.85999999999999s)]
*  beyond spin. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=172.5s)]
*  This is an early version of the cover-up. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=174.33999999999997s)]
*  While Nixon may have publicly signed that campaign finance bill, behind the scenes the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=177.01999999999998s)]
*  administration was neck deep in corruption and was working hard to keep it under wraps. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=182.45999999999998s)]
*  This series is about the master plan to legalize corruption in America, a plan that first emerged [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  from the cauldron of Watergate. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=195.42s)]
*  Pieces of that Watergate story will sound familiar, but in this episode, we're going [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=197.66s)]
*  to tell you things you've probably never heard before. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=202.22s)]
*  Think of this moment in 1972 as the opening salvo in a long game that stretches to the [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=205.62s)]
*  moment we're living in right now. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=211.5s)]
*  A game with wins and losses, where some of the players are trying to shore up protections [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=213.5s)]
*  against corruption, while others are seeking ways to remove those guardrails. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=218.3s)]
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Master Plan. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=223.86s)]
*  It's 1972, five months before Ehrlichman's interview on 30 Minutes With, and just a few [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=253.86s)]
*  days before key parts of the Federal Election Campaign Act are set to take effect. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=274.06s)]
*  When men began arriving at Dulles International Airport on the edge of Washington, D.C., it [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=279.78s)]
*  was springtime in the nation's capital. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=284.85999999999996s)]
*  Those guys arriving at the airport were carrying bags, briefcases, satchels, attache cases [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=287.38s)]
*  were popular, and their bags were filled with money, literally stuffed with cash. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  Lots of cash. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=300.34s)]
*  From the airport, they'd drive directly to the same place, 1701 Pennsylvania Avenue, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=301.97999999999996s)]
*  from the White House. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=309.14s)]
*  Where were they going? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=310.74s)]
*  The Office of the Campaign to Re-elect the President, C-R-E-E-P. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=312.0s)]
*  Yes, Richard Nixon's campaign was called Creep. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=316.58s)]
*  Pretty on brand. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=322.21999999999997s)]
*  Inside of Creep's office, workers were frantic. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=323.86s)]
*  Political campaigns are used to dealing with large amounts of money, but this was very [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  different. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=331.78s)]
*  Yeah, you really can't make this stuff up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=332.78s)]
*  One day, a top executive from Pennzoil showed up at Creep and handed over $150,000 in cash [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=335.08s)]
*  and $550,000 in checks and stock certificates. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=340.94s)]
*  This is Master Plan producer Laura Krantz. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=345.2s)]
*  There was a New Jersey financier that sent over a worn leather bag with $200,000 of neatly [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  wrapped $100 bills. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=353.4s)]
*  Howard Hughes' rep dropped off blank checks for the campaign to fill in themselves. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  How do I get one of those? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=361.56s)]
*  I know, right? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=363.08s)]
*  But get this, in just one two-day period, Creep handled about $6 million. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=364.08s)]
*  That's about $45 million in today's money. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=369.47999999999996s)]
*  No surprise that much of that money was coming from the kinds of donors who wanted political [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=372.35999999999996s)]
*  favors from the Nixon White House. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=376.96s)]
*  From approval of mergers, to get out of jail free cards, to the dairy price supports that [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  you heard about in episode one. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=383.44s)]
*  Right, but David, you just said that Nixon had already signed FICA. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  Wasn't it supposed to limit donations and make info about them public? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  It was, but Creep had found a way to get around the guardrails. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=393.76s)]
*  And the mastermind of all this was G. Gordon Liddy. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  If you're even remotely familiar with Watergate, you know who this guy is. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=402.03999999999996s)]
*  The bald, crazy-eyed former FBI agent with the bristlebrush mustache. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=406.12s)]
*  The guy who would hold his hand over a candle to show his tolerance for pain. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=410.84s)]
*  He's known for coming up with the Watergate burglary. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=415.4s)]
*  But what most folks don't know is that he was also the architect of this incredibly [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=418.21999999999997s)]
*  bold plan to get around campaign finance laws. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=423.46s)]
*  It actually was amazing, if highly sketchy. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=426.9s)]
*  Officially, Liddy was the general counsel for Creep. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=429.97999999999996s)]
*  The guy whose job it was to make sure the committee followed the law. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=432.85999999999996s)]
*  But we got ahold of this memo he wrote to the White House about using a loophole to [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=437.06s)]
*  get around the new law. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=440.9s)]
*  Here's how it worked. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=443.09999999999997s)]
*  Nixon signed FICA into law on February 7th, but the campaigns still had 60 days before [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=444.88s)]
*  they had to follow the new disclosure requirements. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=450.94s)]
*  Liddy suggested that Creep use this gap between the end of the old disclosure laws and the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=454.42s)]
*  beginning of the new ones as a magical window of no campaign finance disclosure requirements [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=460.1s)]
*  at all. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=466.86s)]
*  A window that would make it legal for Nixon's donors to secretly dump completely anonymous [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=467.86s)]
*  bags of cash onto the campaign. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=473.42s)]
*  Liddy's scheme ended up not being as much of a secret as Nixon's team might have wanted. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=476.02s)]
*  The New York Times ran a front page story about it with a line that said, quote, President [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=480.7s)]
*  Nixon's chief campaign fundraiser has been urging contributors to make their gifts to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=485.26s)]
*  Republicans before the law takes effect on April 7th. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=489.09999999999997s)]
*  The story also mentioned a letter from the Nixon campaign that told donors how to get [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=493.18s)]
*  around reporting their contributions. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=498.0s)]
*  Once word got out about the Nixon campaign's free for all fundraising scheme, other campaigns [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=500.58s)]
*  suit both Republican and Democrat, but no one was doing it at the scale of Creep. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=506.91999999999996s)]
*  And the legality of it was questionable. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=513.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean, the strategy did come from G. Gordon Liddy, not exactly the most upstanding guy. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=515.0799999999999s)]
*  And then of course, headlines like this one started hitting the airwaves. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=521.78s)]
*  The Democratic National Committee is housed in the fashionable Watergate complex. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=525.52s)]
*  The break-in was apparently planned well in advance. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=529.86s)]
*  What you might not have known is that some of that anonymous money going into Creep [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=532.6s)]
*  during the magical window funded the Watergate break-in and provided hush money for the burglars. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=537.32s)]
*  At the time, no one outside of Nixon's inner circle knew what the money was being used [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=543.66s)]
*  for. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=548.0s)]
*  This would be uncovered later during the Watergate investigations. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=549.0s)]
*  The burglary and the subsequent cover-up were the sexy side of that scandal, the stuff Hollywood [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=552.4200000000001s)]
*  latched onto. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=557.52s)]
*  So that's what we all remember today. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=558.52s)]
*  But the secret campaign money was the real foundation of Watergate. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=561.0s)]
*  It illustrated how deep the corruption problem still ran, even after Congress was shamed [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=565.32s)]
*  into passing FICA. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=570.16s)]
*  And at least one set of people were aware of that corruption problem. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=571.92s)]
*  The campaign finance watchdogs who had led the fight to pass FICA in the first place. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=576.08s)]
*  Those watchdogs wanted to know who had donated all that money flowing into Nixon's campaign. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=581.5s)]
*  Anonymous, remember? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=587.52s)]
*  Only Nixon and his cronies actually knew the names. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=589.24s)]
*  But a lawsuit was about to change that. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=592.8s)]
*  Okay, so anonymous money poured into Nixon's campaign thanks to G. Gordon Liddy's scheme. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=603.76s)]
*  And a few months later, Nixon's aide John Ehrlichman appeared on PBS in that interview [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=609.48s)]
*  you heard at the top of the episode. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=614.24s)]
*  The one where he insisted the Nixon White House was a corruption-free zone. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=616.08s)]
*  In preparation for that interview, Ehrlichman met with Nixon in the Oval Office. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=621.0400000000001s)]
*  And Nixon seemed particularly interested in one guy. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=625.84s)]
*  This recording, like many of Nixon's White House tapes, is difficult to make out. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=639.36s)]
*  But you can hear Nixon say the name John Gardner. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=643.96s)]
*  Who is John Gardner? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=647.52s)]
*  He'd been a cabinet official under Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=649.8000000000001s)]
*  But more recently, he'd founded a citizens advocacy group known as Common Cause. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=653.24s)]
*  We want public officials to have literally millions of American citizens looking over [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=658.84s)]
*  their shoulders at every move that they make. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=663.12s)]
*  That's John Gardner describing the mission of Common Cause. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=666.88s)]
*  Side note, Nixon reportedly asked Gardner to be his vice presidential running mate in [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=670.16s)]
*  1968. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=674.8s)]
*  Gardner declined and then became one of Nixon's least favorite people. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=676.24s)]
*  They probably wouldn't have been a good match anyway. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=680.04s)]
*  Gardner was committed to making political institutions more open and accountable. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=683.3199999999999s)]
*  And Nixon was committed to, well, the opposite. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=687.48s)]
*  Common Cause wanted to know who had donated to the Nixon re-election campaign during that [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=691.48s)]
*  disclosure-free window in the spring of 1972. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=696.04s)]
*  Since no one in the White House was divulging any information, Common Cause filed a federal [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=700.28s)]
*  lawsuit. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=705.56s)]
*  Gardner spoke about it at a press conference on September 6th, the day before Ehrlichman [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=706.56s)]
*  and Nixon met in the Oval Office. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=711.16s)]
*  In recent months, citizens have been treated to several highly questionable instances of [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=713.3199999999999s)]
*  huge sums flowing to the president's political campaign while government favors flowed in [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=718.4s)]
*  the opposite direction. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=724.44s)]
*  Perhaps the instances were all coincidental. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=725.96s)]
*  The way to dispel the aura of mystery and suspicion is to bring all the facts out in [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=729.44s)]
*  the open. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=735.0400000000001s)]
*  That is the purpose of our suit. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=736.0400000000001s)]
*  Creep thought they'd found a loophole that allowed them to temporarily raise millions [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=738.48s)]
*  of dollars anonymously. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=742.72s)]
*  Common Cause discovered a loophole to their loophole and found a way to use an older campaign [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=745.0s)]
*  finance law against them. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=750.08s)]
*  This might seem like boring legalese, but national news picked up the story because [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=752.44s)]
*  it was directly connected to Watergate. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=757.3000000000001s)]
*  The courts will have to say if such a suit under the old corrupt practices act can be [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=759.84s)]
*  won, but the administration apparently takes it seriously enough to have asked that this [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=763.8000000000001s)]
*  suit be held off. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=767.5600000000001s)]
*  If a suit like this were won, it would clear up a lot about the Watergate bugging and more [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=769.32s)]
*  than that, expose just those Nixon contributors who made their contributions before April [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=774.12s)]
*  7th in order not to be disclosed. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=779.36s)]
*  That was on September 6th. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=782.08s)]
*  The next morning, Nixon and Ehrlichman planned out their response in the Oval Office. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=783.84s)]
*  This clean corruption-free administration? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=788.7800000000001s)]
*  It opted to go with smear tactics. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=792.44s)]
*  I think the line on that is Common Cause has not succeeded in raising money. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=794.6s)]
*  They needed some high visibility maneuver and this is obviously a last gasp by John [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=800.6s)]
*  Garter in the time he and Common Cause flowed in his shirt hats. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=806.44s)]
*  Yep, Nixon just called John Gardner an ass. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=810.36s)]
*  He really hated this guy. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=813.4s)]
*  A few hours later in that PBS interview you heard at the top, journalist Elizabeth Drew [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=817.84s)]
*  asked John Ehrlichman about a brand new development having to do with donations to the Nixon [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=823.14s)]
*  campaign. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=828.32s)]
*  Common Cause filed a suit yesterday, as you know, to force the revelation of who contributed [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=829.32s)]
*  the $10 million to the president before April 7th. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=836.6s)]
*  Do you think that that might bring about before the election any kind of revelation [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=840.0s)]
*  of who the contributors were? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=844.2s)]
*  Well, I don't think it should because I think the whole spirit of the law that the Congress [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=845.48s)]
*  adopted involved a freedom from disclosure of any contributor prior to a certain date. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=851.18s)]
*  Make note of that. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=858.56s)]
*  Ehrlichman is arguing that the lawless period wasn't a bug, it was a feature. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=859.56s)]
*  He's arguing that the lawmakers who passed the new campaign finance disclosure law intentionally [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=864.6s)]
*  created a period to allow anonymous bags of cash to flow to the president's campaign. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=870.36s)]
*  And now these annoying campaign finance reformers want Nixon to tell America who his donors [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=876.44s)]
*  are? [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=881.48s)]
*  How dare they? [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=882.48s)]
*  Elizabeth Drew pressed Ehrlichman about this. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=883.64s)]
*  The current law said they didn't have to report before April 7th, but what Common Cause's [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=885.88s)]
*  that the Corrupt Practices Act was in effect until then, and that did require the publication [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=890.48s)]
*  of everybody who had contributed more than $100. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=896.12s)]
*  So they say that the committee broke the law. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=899.28s)]
*  In response to this perfectly reasonable assertion, Ehrlichman whips out the smear he'd rehearsed [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=901.88s)]
*  with the president that very morning. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=907.92s)]
*  I suspect maybe Common Cause is looking for a little rehabilitation. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=909.56s)]
*  I understand that Mr. Gardner and his organization are in a little difficulty in terms of being [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=913.28s)]
*  able to raise money and keep alive. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=917.76s)]
*  Maybe this is their salvation, I don't know, but they're keeping their name in the paper [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=920.16s)]
*  anyway. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=924.72s)]
*  Bravo. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=925.72s)]
*  Give that man an Oscar. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=926.72s)]
*  What a performance. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=928.72s)]
*  He delivered that line even more smoothly than he had during his practice run with Nixon [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=930.04s)]
*  that morning. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=935.08s)]
*  But while Nixon officials were publicly brushing off Common Cause, behind the scenes, this [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=936.08s)]
*  was clearly a problem for the White House, and it was not going away. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=941.76s)]
*  The issue of disclosure was central to all of this. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=946.4s)]
*  FICA required candidates to disclose any expenditures or contributions that exceeded $100. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=949.72s)]
*  It required disclosure reporting for candidates, political parties, and political action committees. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=956.22s)]
*  It also required candidates to file spending reports periodically to administrative offices, [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=961.96s)]
*  deep within the bowels of the Capitol. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=966.72s)]
*  We thought no one's going to look at them, and the public is not going to find out this [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=968.72s)]
*  information. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=973.2s)]
*  If reporters don't have it before them, because it would take a hell of a lot of work to review [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=974.62s)]
*  these reports. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=981.1s)]
*  That's Fred Wertheimer, who in 1972 was the young legislative director for Common Cause. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=982.86s)]
*  He told us that to make sure the media and the public would get this information, he'd [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=988.54s)]
*  send volunteers up to Capitol Hill to buy photocopies of each report. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=993.18s)]
*  Then they'd write up that information into press releases for each state and congressional [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=998.0s)]
*  district, sharing what campaign had received how much money and from whom. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1001.98s)]
*  Over the course of the 1972 campaign, Common Cause uncovered widespread violations of the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1007.1800000000001s)]
*  new law and filed complaints against 128 Democrats and 98 Republicans in various congressional [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1012.7s)]
*  races. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1020.0600000000001s)]
*  It came as something of a shock to candidates to learn that someone was actually watching. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1021.0600000000001s)]
*  But Common Cause also had its eyes at the top of the ticket on the presidential race. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1026.8s)]
*  Following Creep's lead, other presidential campaigns had also amassed piles of money, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1032.04s)]
*  taking advantage of the window of lawlessness. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1037.48s)]
*  Common Cause urged all presidential candidates to reveal their pre-April 7th donations. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1040.72s)]
*  Having brought in so much cash, in such a corrupt fashion, Creep needed to keep their [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1047.32s)]
*  donors anonymous, and they had a whole laundry list of reasons explaining why. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1052.4s)]
*  The law didn't require it. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1057.68s)]
*  It would be unfair to donors, John Ehrlichman's argument on PBS. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1059.04s)]
*  Other campaigns haven't done it. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1062.88s)]
*  And even when the other campaigns did give up their donor info, Creep still refused. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1064.92s)]
*  Here's Fred Wertheimer again. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1070.92s)]
*  They said nuts to you. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1072.2s)]
*  They fought us. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1074.04s)]
*  We sued Nixon and within a few weeks we got a letter from the IRS telling us they were [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1075.44s)]
*  investigating our tax status. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1081.4s)]
*  What a coincidence. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1084.64s)]
*  Regardless, Common Cause pushed the lawsuit forward even as election day drew closer. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1086.0s)]
*  Facing a court order, Creep suddenly agreed to a concession. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  They'd hand over information about donors who gave in the first two months of 1972, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1095.24s)]
*  January and February, conveniently leaving out donations from the 60-day window. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1100.72s)]
*  Still, when news broke that even a partial list was being released, it caused quite a stir. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1106.6000000000001s)]
*  ABC's David Schumacher reports. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1112.3600000000001s)]
*  In this TV clip, Gardner, with reporters in tow, is marching into Creep's offices to [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1114.8s)]

*  Powell Moore. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1125.72s)]
*  Mr. Moore did not come right out, but a security man did. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1126.72s)]
*  And he tried to block photographers. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1129.92s)]
*  Well, we've been asking the press people to get out of here. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1131.72s)]
*  Just don't even touch me. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1135.72s)]
*  Okay, you wait. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1136.72s)]
*  You wait. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1137.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1138.72s)]
*  Don't touch me. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1139.72s)]
*  In this footage, we see a grainy hand appear over the lens, pushing the camera down. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1140.92s)]
*  The security man finally gave up, and so did Gardner. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1145.4s)]
*  After waiting in vain for 25 minutes, he walked back to his office, leaving lawyers behind [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1148.8s)]
*  to pick up their list, reporters elbowing lawyers for their own copies. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1152.96s)]
*  The news story picks up later that day at the Common Cause office, where we see rooms [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1156.88s)]
*  of young volunteers. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1161.32s)]
*  They're sporting some quintessential 70s outfits, along with handlebar mustaches, big collars, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1162.88s)]
*  and big hair. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1169.0s)]
*  Most of them look fresh-faced, barely out of college, as they begin to sort through [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1170.36s)]
*  the preliminary donor information they'd managed to extract from CREEP. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1174.36s)]
*  They didn't get the Holy Grail, the anonymous donor list from the secret window, but they'd [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1178.36s)]
*  gotten something. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1183.7199999999998s)]
*  A quick total for Chairman Gardner, just under $5 million. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1184.7199999999998s)]
*  Heading the list, Chicago insurance man Clement Stone. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  A million dollars reinforcing rumors he's about to be appointed ambassador to Great [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1191.1999999999998s)]
*  Britain. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1194.9199999999998s)]
*  Next, $800,000 from Richard Scaife of the wealthy Mellon family. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1195.92s)]
*  Arthur Watson, former ambassador to France, gave $300,000. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1200.44s)]
*  John Mulcahy of New York, host to the president on his trip to Ireland, 255,000. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1204.64s)]
*  And unearthing those numbers was just the start of a tremendous amount of work. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1210.3600000000001s)]
*  Nowadays, if we get the name of some person, we just type it into an internet search, and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1215.16s)]
*  up pops the information we need. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1220.0800000000002s)]
*  These common cause volunteers in 1972 are having to search for donor identities by furiously [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1222.5s)]
*  flipping through giant phone books and reference periodicals. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1229.0s)]
*  They're calling operators in other states using rotary phones. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1233.1399999999999s)]
*  Do you have any idea how long that takes? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1237.46s)]
*  I mean, they're tapping numbers into calculators the size of toasters. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1239.98s)]
*  They're cross-checking all of this data with pencil and paper. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1244.78s)]
*  My hand hurts just thinking about it. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1249.1399999999999s)]
*  You can see why nobody else had bothered to do this before. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1251.78s)]
*  And this was just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1255.94s)]
*  As the media pointed out, the biggest donors had yet to be unmasked. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1257.98s)]
*  The Republicans still have not identified their contributors for the month of March, [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1262.02s)]
*  the month the committee to reelect the president pushed hardest for big money. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1265.98s)]
*  The court suit on that is still to come, but there was enough information on hand for now [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1269.58s)]
*  to keep the lights at common cause burning through the night. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1273.8999999999999s)]
*  The disclosure came only a few days before the election, and it had almost zero effect [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1277.14s)]
*  on the outcome. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1281.9s)]
*  Nixon was reelected, defeating George McGovern in a landslide. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1283.0600000000002s)]
*  CREEP, though, still refused to turn over any information about the bags of cash from [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1293.1000000000001s)]
*  March and April during Liddy's magic window, so common cause continued to press their lawsuit. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1298.18s)]
*  Their lawyers spent the early part of 1973 deposing Nixon's White House and campaign [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1304.7s)]
*  officials. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1310.06s)]
*  All of them insisted that the records from the spring of 1972 had been destroyed, which [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1311.18s)]
*  was almost certainly true since CREEP officials basically moonlighted as professional document [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1316.18s)]
*  shredders. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1322.22s)]
*  But then a campaign official let slip that one document hadn't been shredded, a list [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1327.3s)]
*  of Nixon's most important contributors of all, the guys with the biggest bags of money. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1332.86s)]
*  This list was in a locked drawer in the desk of President Nixon's personal secretary, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1339.18s)]
*  Rosemary Woods, right next to the Oval Office. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1344.18s)]
*  This document could potentially unlock everything that common cause wanted to know. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1347.8999999999999s)]
*  Obtaining it became an obsession. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1353.74s)]
*  But Secret Donor List doesn't really roll off the tongue, so they gave it a catchy nickname. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1356.42s)]
*  Fresh in the Minds of Common Cause Staff was a wildly popular psychological horror film [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1363.78s)]
*  that had come out a few years earlier about a young mother being secretly manipulated [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1370.26s)]
*  by an evil cult. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  The mother's name? [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1382.8999999999999s)]
*  Rosemary, just like Nixon's secretary. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1384.58s)]
*  And that's how this coveted secret list came to be known as Rosemary's Baby. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1389.1000000000001s)]
*  It took nine months from when Common Cause filed its initial lawsuit, but Rosemary's [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1395.74s)]
*  Baby was finally delivered in June 1973. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1401.66s)]
*  After all those court filings, motions, and counter motions, network television reported [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1406.46s)]
*  that a federal judge officially ordered the White House to turn the list over. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1412.02s)]
*  The White House confirmed today that it has a copy of the list of campaign donations [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1416.34s)]
*  received before the new April 7th reporting deadline. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1420.58s)]
*  Assistant Press Secretary Gerald Warren insisted the president has never seen the list. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1423.86s)]
*  And what a list it was. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1428.3799999999999s)]
*  Really more of a book. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1429.82s)]
*  Coming in at a whopping one and a half inches thick, it showed contributions that added [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1431.1799999999998s)]
*  up to more than $19 million in undisclosed donations to Nixon's re-election fund. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1435.6599999999999s)]
*  All in all, creep raised nearly $55 million. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1442.22s)]
*  That's the equivalent of, let me get my calculator here, $407 million in today's dollars. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1447.1000000000001s)]
*  An eye-popping amount. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1456.3s)]
*  And much of it had been kept a secret. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1458.1000000000001s)]
*  You already know that Secretary Richardson has asked me to prosecute the offenses growing [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1461.42s)]
*  out of the, breaking into the Watergate and other related allegations. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1467.02s)]
*  That's Archibald Cox in May 1973, accepting the job of special prosecutor with the United [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1474.18s)]
*  States Department of Justice. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1480.3s)]
*  He's tall, with a buzz cut, and looks better in a bow tie than Tucker Carlson ever did. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1482.18s)]
*  Cox would oversee the federal criminal investigation into the failed Watergate burglary, which [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1487.54s)]
*  had happened just shy of a year earlier. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1492.7s)]
*  And his name is pretty familiar to anyone with even a passing knowledge of Watergate. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1495.18s)]
*  And Watergate was huge. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1499.66s)]
*  Cox understood that one investigation would be insufficient and incredibly unwieldy. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1502.0600000000002s)]
*  This was too big, and it went far beyond the bungled burglary that we're all so familiar [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1507.46s)]
*  with. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1512.3400000000001s)]
*  So he divided the investigation into task forces. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1513.3400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so a few of them investigated Watergate itself. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1515.9s)]
*  The break-in, the political dirty tricks, and the infamous White House plumbers' efforts [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1518.9s)]
*  to stop leaks. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1523.62s)]
*  But two other task forces focused on the part of Watergate that's often forgotten. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1525.1799999999998s)]
*  The corruption. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1530.4599999999998s)]
*  One looked at a scandal in which one of the country's largest telephone companies pledged [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1531.4599999999998s)]
*  $400,000 to the Republican Party in exchange for a favorable Nixon administration settlement [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1536.4599999999998s)]
*  in an antitrust lawsuit. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1542.6999999999998s)]
*  And the final task force, the one that's most important to our story, focused on campaign [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1544.58s)]
*  contributions. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1550.34s)]
*  The mission of these prosecutors was straightforward. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1551.58s)]
*  Follow the money. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1554.82s)]
*  Just follow the money. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1555.82s)]
*  The campaign contribution task force honed in on that dairy scandal that we talked about [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1558.3799999999999s)]
*  in the first episode, the $2 million that the associated milk producers gave to Nixon's [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1563.5s)]
*  campaign in 1971. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1568.98s)]
*  But it was that window in the spring of 1972 before FICA came into effect where the task [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1571.5s)]
*  force focused much of its attention. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1577.54s)]
*  Who had contributed to the mountains of cash that came rolling into Nixon's re-election [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1579.9s)]
*  war chest? [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1584.3000000000002s)]
*  Were any of those donors promised government favors or threatened with government retribution [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1585.3000000000002s)]
*  if they failed to pay up? [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1589.94s)]
*  Just how legal or illegal was all of that money? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1591.8200000000002s)]
*  Thanks to John Gardner and Common Cause, the question of who had been partially answered. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1596.18s)]
*  Those names were now in the hands of Watergate prosecutors, including a young lawyer named [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1601.8200000000002s)]
*  who spoke to us about his work during this period. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1607.74s)]
*  I didn't know anything about any subject we were confronting when I walked in the door. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1610.38s)]
*  For a young lawyer at the beginning of his career without any prosecutorial experience, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1616.6200000000001s)]
*  it was exciting and it was scary. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1623.42s)]
*  The spotlight was shining brightly on us and we wanted to do it right and fairly. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1625.3s)]
*  Whitten had been Archibald Cox's student at Harvard Law School and in 1973, he joined [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1630.3s)]
*  the Watergate Special Prosecution Force. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1635.32s)]
*  He'd be working to find any evidence of illegal campaign finance activity. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1638.12s)]
*  It was clear fairly early on that the hush money paid to the Watergate burglars came [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1642.76s)]
*  directly or indirectly from illegal campaign contributions. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1648.3999999999999s)]
*  But the Campaign Contributions Task Force wanted to know more about the contributions [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1652.0s)]
*  themselves. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1655.96s)]
*  As we've heard throughout this episode, the Nixon campaign had made a big push to get [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1656.96s)]
*  as much money as possible before FICA went into effect. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1661.36s)]
*  The reason for that push was because FICA's disclosure requirements went way beyond those [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1665.36s)]
*  of the older law, the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1670.8s)]
*  And we wondered why were they so interested in making secret contributions? [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1674.32s)]
*  What were they trying to hide? [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1678.76s)]
*  And that's the question we tried to answer. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1680.6399999999999s)]
*  And in a number of cases, we were able to show that they were seeking influence by making [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1683.4399999999998s)]
*  large contributions secretly to the president's re-election campaign. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1690.08s)]
*  The information on who had donated to Nixon's campaign came from a variety of sources. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1694.28s)]
*  Members of CREEP, the president's personal lawyer, reporting from the press corps, hat [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1699.84s)]
*  tip to Woodward and Bernstein, and of course, the Rosemary's baby list obtained by Common [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1704.28s)]
*  Cause. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1710.48s)]
*  Somehow this great mass of information got sorted into charges or not charges against [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1711.48s)]
*  companies and people. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1717.0s)]
*  And who were those companies and people? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1718.32s)]
*  I made a little list. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1720.76s)]
*  There was the milk investigation, which had its own sub team. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1723.6399999999999s)]
*  I thought milk was healthy and clean, but it wasn't. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1729.52s)]
*  There were a number of well-known large companies, Gulf Oil, Ashland Oil, Northrop, Phillips [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1733.2s)]
*  Petroleum, Goodyear, Occidental. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1739.84s)]
*  Since FICA hadn't yet gone into effect when this money made its way into Nixon's coffers, [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1742.72s)]
*  the Watergate Corruption Task Force had to rely on older criminal statutes in order to [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1747.68s)]
*  press charges. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1752.72s)]
*  Up until this point, those laws went almost unenforced. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1754.02s)]
*  But amid the Watergate scandal, prosecutors were now going to aggressively enforce their [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1757.74s)]
*  prohibition against corporate money flowing directly into campaigns. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1762.94s)]
*  As the prosecution began charging companies and officials, Witten says they offered leniency [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1767.8s)]
*  corporations that came in voluntarily to self-disclose and cooperate with the investigation. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1773.3s)]
*  We were quite open to plea bargains because frankly, we didn't have the resources to try [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1779.06s)]
*  20 cases. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1784.96s)]
*  We thought also that we could accomplish a lot by holding these companies and these senior [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1787.16s)]
*  executives up to public scrutiny. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1793.72s)]
*  We live in an era where corporate executives almost never get prosecuted for anything, [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1797.04s)]
*  where bankers can rip off millions of homeowners and oil CEOs can light the climate on fire [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1802.86s)]
*  with no consequences. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1808.06s)]
*  But notice how Witten said that back in 1973, government prosecutors looking at corruption [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1809.8999999999999s)]
*  were going after both huge blue chip companies and their individual corporate executives. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1816.4199999999998s)]
*  This is a big deal and almost unimaginable today. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1823.32s)]
*  Watergate prosecutors were trying to send a very specific message. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1827.5s)]
*  We were not going to just let the corporation dig into its pocket and pay. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1831.9s)]
*  The gilded pleas and the plea bargains were a deterrent to others not to engage in this misconduct. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1836.7s)]
*  Because even though you're pleading guilty to a misdemeanor, it's not a high priority [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1843.9s)]
*  of a CEO of a name-brand company to go to court and confess guilt in connection with a crime. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1847.5600000000002s)]
*  On October 17, 1973, special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a statement indicating that both [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1854.3400000000001s)]
*  the corporations and their primary responsible corporate officers would be charged. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1861.34s)]
*  That same day, news outlets eagerly reported on the fallout. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1867.22s)]
*  Three big U.S. corporations pleaded guilty today to making each more than $125,000 in [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1870.8999999999999s)]
*  illegal contributions to President Nixon's 1972 campaign. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1877.06s)]
*  The firms are Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, and American Airlines. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1880.98s)]
*  In court, attorney Herbert Miller said the airline pleaded guilty. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1886.86s)]
*  Reportedly, its $55,000 donation was laundered through accounts in Lebanon. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1890.26s)]
*  Prosecutor Thomas McBride warned that he will seek tougher penalties, which could mean jail [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1895.54s)]
*  for corporation executives who do not come forward as American Airlines did. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1899.58s)]
*  By the way, I remember being a teenager and first learning about Watergate from a TV mini-series [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1904.02s)]
*  in the 1990s that included this commercial. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1909.34s)]
*  This presentation of Watergate is sponsored in part by American Airlines. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1912.46s)]
*  I guess I didn't realize how on-the-nose that really was. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1917.26s)]
*  In essence, Watergate was the first campaign finance scandal of the modern era, and it [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1921.6599999999999s)]
*  exposed incredible corporate corruption. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1926.5s)]
*  Ultimately, the Campaign Contribution Task Force obtained convictions of 19 companies [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1929.62s)]
*  and 21 executives for making illegal corporate contributions to President Nixon's campaign, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1935.02s)]
*  which then used some of that money to fund activities like the Watergate break-in. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1941.1s)]
*  Remember John Ehrlichman's claim? [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1945.26s)]
*  By any standard you'd want to apply, there's been an extraordinarily clean corruption-free administration. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1946.78s)]
*  Yeah, not so much. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1953.42s)]
*  And then Nixon decided to make things worse for himself. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1955.54s)]
*  Just three days after Cox's press conference and the guilty pleas of those big companies, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1959.1399999999999s)]
*  Nixon ordered Archibald Cox to be fired. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1964.3799999999999s)]
*  The two top men at the Justice Department refused to do it, so it fell to the third in line. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1967.46s)]
*  Robert Bork, a name we'll hear again and again in this series. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1972.9s)]
*  The firing of Cox was part of what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1977.8200000000002s)]
*  The public was outraged. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  In an effort to contain the fallout, Nixon gave a televised press conference. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1985.74s)]
*  I made my mistakes, but in all of my years of public life, I have never profited, never [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1989.8200000000002s)]
*  profited from public service. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1997.14s)]
*  I've earned every cent. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=1999.18s)]
*  Side note, he gave this speech at Disney World, which is worth mentioning because we'll be [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2000.74s)]
*  back to the Magic Kingdom in the not-too-distant future. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2005.1799999999998s)]
*  Bookmark Disney World. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2008.74s)]
*  A lot of weird shit happens there. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2009.86s)]
*  I have never obstructed justice. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2011.86s)]
*  I welcome this kind of examination because people have got to know whether or not their [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2013.98s)]
*  president's a crook. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2018.3s)]
*  Well, I'm not a crook. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2019.3s)]
*  I've earned everything I've got. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2021.34s)]
*  Obviously the best way to assure people you're not a criminal is to desperately insist that [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2024.22s)]
*  you're not a criminal. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2028.5s)]
*  But by the time Nixon delivered that now famous line, the damage was done. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2030.8600000000001s)]
*  Millions of Americans had been watching the nationally televised Senate Watergate hearings [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2035.5s)]
*  unfold under the leadership of Senator Sam Ervin, who honed in on the link between corruption, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2040.02s)]
*  campaign finance, and the burglary. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2046.54s)]
*  Didn't you suspect that when you raised this money and distributed it in this surreptitious [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2048.9s)]
*  manner to the lawyers and families of the parties that had been indicted in the Watergate [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2055.86s)]
*  that you were aiding the Nixon campaign for reelection? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2061.6200000000003s)]
*  Americans glued to their televisions heard the dramatic stories about bags of cash, political [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2066.94s)]
*  intrigue, and straight-up corruption. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2071.9s)]
*  Even before the Saturday Night Massacre, a Gallup poll confirmed that Americans considered [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2075.1800000000003s)]
*  government graft one of the most important problems facing the nation. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2079.98s)]
*  Campaign finance and political corruption would be key issues in the upcoming 1974 midterm [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2085.02s)]
*  elections. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2090.82s)]
*  And thanks to Nixon, the Democrats, along with a coalition of reformers and organizations [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2092.02s)]
*  like Common Cause, saw both a political opportunity and a chance to fix the system. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2097.42s)]
*  They began pushing a package of amendments that would strengthen the 1971 Federal Election [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2103.34s)]
*  Campaign Act. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2108.7400000000002s)]
*  I think this is the single most important issue that can be resolved by this Congress. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2109.7400000000002s)]
*  Hey Laura, does that voice sound vaguely familiar? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2113.9s)]
*  Uh, no. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2116.46s)]
*  Not ringing a bell. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2117.46s)]
*  Who is it? [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2118.46s)]
*  That's Joe Biden in a televised debate back when he was a fresh-faced 31-year-old Senator. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2119.46s)]
*  He was one of the lawmakers involved in passing amendments to strengthen FICA. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2125.66s)]
*  Now, it would have been delicious to see supervillain Richard Nixon shamed into signing new, even [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2130.1s)]
*  tougher anti-corruption bills into law. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2135.82s)]
*  But he'd already thrown in the towel by the time they passed. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2138.46s)]
*  I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2141.34s)]
*  Vice President Ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2144.9s)]
*  That left Gerald Ford holding the pen. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2151.34s)]
*  He'd been a long-time Republican leader in the U.S. House, and Ford probably didn't [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2153.7000000000003s)]
*  like the new, tougher campaign finance legislation any more than Nixon would have. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2158.42s)]
*  We'll hear more about old Jerry in a future episode. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2163.3s)]
*  But the political climate meant Ford had no choice but to grit his teeth and sign the [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2166.78s)]
*  bill during a televised ceremony. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2172.0600000000004s)]
*  A major legislative outgrowth of the Watergate scandal was the campaign financing reform [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2174.2200000000003s)]
*  bill. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2178.78s)]
*  President Ford signed that into law in a ceremony today. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2179.78s)]
*  The president invited Congress into watch and about a hundred members showed up for [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2182.5600000000004s)]
*  the East Room ceremony. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2186.1800000000003s)]
*  Among other things, the bill limits the amount individuals can contribute to candidates, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2187.1800000000003s)]
*  puts a $20 million spending limit on presidential races, and provides some public financing [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2191.5s)]
*  of the presidential campaigns through voluntary $1 deductions which voters can take on income [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2196.58s)]
*  tax. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2202.04s)]
*  When signing the bill, President Ford explicitly acknowledged how angry the public was at the [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2203.04s)]
*  corruption that had taken over Washington. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2208.46s)]
*  I can assure you from what I've heard from the American people in writing and other communications, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2210.9s)]
*  they want this legislation. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2216.94s)]
*  So it'll soon be law. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2219.1s)]
*  We do recognize that this legislation seeks to eliminate to a maximum degree some of the [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2221.68s)]
*  influences that have created some of the problems in recent years. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2228.7799999999997s)]
*  And if that is the end result, certainly it's worth all the labor and all the compromises [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2234.3199999999997s)]
*  that were necessary in the process. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2241.12s)]
*  Wow. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2244.12s)]
*  What a wild trip it's been. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2245.22s)]
*  Without the original FICA and that magical window of lawlessness, those bags of secret [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2247.94s)]
*  money may never have been dumped into Nixon's campaign. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2252.84s)]
*  Without that money and all the corruption and scandal that came out of Watergate, these [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2256.62s)]
*  reforms may never have happened. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2260.84s)]
*  If as the old saying goes, every crisis is an opportunity, then the work of reformers [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2263.2400000000002s)]
*  and organizations like Common Cause made sure that when something as bad as Watergate happened, [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2268.58s)]
*  it could become a moment for progress. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2274.32s)]
*  Watergate was the trigger because the public would not have engaged. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2278.16s)]
*  People would not have been outraged. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2285.06s)]
*  The stories would not have been there. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2287.3399999999997s)]
*  Look, I've worked on this since 1971. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2289.98s)]
*  We passed the Watergate reforms in 74 because we had enormous public support and demand. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2294.7s)]
*  And so here we are once more, dear listener. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2304.54s)]
*  The forces of corruption have been repelled. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2307.04s)]
*  The man who had come to personify corruption had been ejected from the White House in what [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2309.68s)]
*  seemed like a national referendum for a cleaner government free of big money influence. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2314.3s)]
*  But of course, we have several episodes to go. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2320.72s)]
*  And we now live in a kleptocracy that makes Watergate seem quaint, which means this is [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2323.84s)]
*  not where the story ends. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2328.6s)]
*  This is where the story really begins. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2330.88s)]
*  Because even though he was forced into an early California retirement, Richard Nixon [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2333.86s)]
*  had left the American people a present, a time bomb back in Washington, one that was [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2338.46s)]
*  ticking away. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2344.42s)]
*  I hope you will raise your right hand and repeat after me. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2345.42s)]
*  I, Lewis F. Powell Jr. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHrtCoRVB5o&t=2348.42s)]
