# Episode 9: Going Big | Master Plan
**The Master Plan:** [November 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE)
*  This is one of my favorites, you know, to be on the front cover of the ABA Journal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, it's like being a rock star being on the front. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=5.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's like being an athlete on the cover of Sports Illustrated. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=8.0s)]
*  Exactly, exactly. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=10.16s)]
*  This is attorney James Bopp. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  He's showing me all the memorabilia of his career scattered around his wood paneled office. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  There's a framed letter from Ronald Reagan. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=19.32s)]
*  There's a photo of him with Dick Cheney. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=21.6s)]
*  And yes, there's him on the cover of the American Bar Association's magazine, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=23.76s)]
*  the ABA Journal, with the headline, The Big Bopper. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=28.04s)]
*  I've seen it written that you filed more campaign finance cases than anyone else. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=32.04s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=36.36s)]
*  More campaign finance cases than anyone else in the country. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=37.64s)]
*  My first big win in the Supreme Court was... [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=42.24s)]
*  The Minnesota case? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=44.84s)]
*  Yeah, right, the Minnesota case. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=45.84s)]
*  When we first reached out to Bopp for an interview, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=47.599999999999994s)]
*  we figured we'd be heading to meet him at some big fancy law office in Washington, D.C. or New York. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=49.96s)]
*  Instead, he told us to meet him at his storefront law office in Terre Haute, Indiana. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=55.76s)]
*  Terre Haute doesn't seem like a bustling hive of political intrigue and master planning. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=61.36s)]
*  Here on this sunny day in late winter, it had the look of lots of Midwest towns whose boom days are long gone. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=66.96s)]
*  There's an ornate courthouse and some big buildings in a sparsely populated downtown. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=73.68s)]
*  It's basically the town from Parks and Rec, in a red state dominated by Ron Swanson politics. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=78.96s)]
*  It's never too early to learn that the government is a greedy piglet that suckles on a taxpayer's teat until they have sore chapped nipples. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=84.96s)]
*  Terre Haute is where Larry Bird played college basketball, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=93.55999999999999s)]
*  where socialist presidential candidate Eugene Debs was born, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=96.88s)]
*  and where Timothy McVeigh was executed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=100.47999999999999s)]
*  But there's a good argument to be made that the Terre Haute-er, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=103.36s)]
*  who's had the most significant long-term impact on America, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=106.56s)]
*  is this affable 76-year-old grandfather in a blue sweater and khakis. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=110.16s)]
*  So the first obvious question I had for James Bopp was this. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=115.52s)]
*  Why does he live here, so far away from the political power brokers that he's trying to influence? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=119.52s)]
*  Well, on third generation, Bopp in Terre Haute, I stayed here because of the culture. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=125.44s)]
*  Married, had three daughters. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=135.52s)]
*  We wanted a relatively conservative cultural environment. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=138.32000000000002s)]
*  And even though Terre Haute at the time was two-to-one Democrat, culturally it was conservative. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=144.0s)]
*  Growing up, Bopp's family wasn't especially political, but his dad did have some clearly defined views. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=151.28s)]
*  He was a doctor, and he really did believe in the Hippocratic oath. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=157.60000000000002s)]
*  Physicians shall do no harm. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=162.16000000000003s)]
*  And so he always thought, you know, abortion was unethical. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=164.32s)]
*  So I developed a lot of my conservative philosophy before I even got to high school. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=168.88s)]
*  Bopp was really clear with us about this point. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=174.23999999999998s)]
*  He's been an unabashed conservative for most of his life, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=177.2s)]
*  and way before he ever cared about campaign finance, he was conservative about abortion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=180.72s)]
*  Just keep that in mind. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  After college at Indiana University and law school in Florida, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=188.72s)]
*  Bopp returned to Terre Haute and worked a stint at the state attorney general's office [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=192.56s)]
*  before becoming the general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=197.04s)]
*  The mood is pride and achievement at this year's convention of the National Right to Life Committee. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=201.28s)]
*  These anti-abortionists have successfully used sophisticated lobbying and public pressure [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=206.4s)]
*  to chip away at the 1973 Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=211.6s)]
*  and they intend to stay on the attack. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=216.72s)]
*  The number of legal abortions continues to rise, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  but pro-abortion leaders are worried nonetheless. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=222.0s)]
*  I think my greatest concern is that they will affect power at the congressional level [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=225.04s)]
*  that is not in fact representative of the will of the people. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=230.32s)]
*  That pro-choice activists' fears were well-founded. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=233.44s)]
*  Changing the political power equation was exactly what young James Bopp [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=236.88s)]
*  planned to do at the National Right to Life Committee. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=241.2s)]
*  They did not have a PAC, and one of my first things I was interested in doing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=243.84s)]
*  was getting National Right to Life to create a PAC, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=249.76s)]
*  because they needed to become more aggressively involved in political activity. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=253.44s)]
*  And one way to do that is to contribute to candidates. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=258.15999999999997s)]
*  But in 1980, when the National Right to Life Committee published voter guides encouraging [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=262.48s)]
*  support for anti-choice candidates, the organization got in trouble for violating the old federal [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=267.2s)]
*  election campaign act. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=273.28s)]
*  That's when Bopp realized that campaign finance restrictions were limiting his [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=274.88s)]
*  organization's ability to achieve its one big goal. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=279.2s)]
*  To design and implement a strategy to overturn Roe v. Wade. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=282.88s)]
*  Increasingly, it seemed like the way to do that was to deregulate the campaign finance system, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  so that the anti-choice movement could get anti-choice politicians elected, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  who would then get anti-choice judges appointed to the bench. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  So Bopp began knitting the two seemingly separate causes together. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=299.84s)]
*  The fight against abortion and the fight against campaign finance regulations. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=303.84s)]
*  And he appropriated his strategy from probably the last person I would have ever guessed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=308.23999999999995s)]
*  The NAACP strategy implemented by Thurgood Marshall and Brown v. Board of Education. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  I mean, what? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=319.84s)]
*  This hyper-conservative anti-choice activist lawyer [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=321.28s)]
*  was inspired by civil rights legend Thurgood Marshall? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=324.96s)]
*  But it's true. He was. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  Bopp tore a page out of the NAACP's playbook. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=331.2s)]
*  He started filing campaign finance suits, a lot of them, over and over. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=334.4s)]
*  And seeing what took, what got accepted to higher courts, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=339.59999999999997s)]
*  and which arguments worked to chip away at campaign finance regulations. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=342.8s)]
*  And he kept his eye on the prize, the Supreme Court. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=347.44s)]
*  He familiarized himself with the justices, their ideologies, and their temperaments. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=350.8s)]
*  I can't make the Supreme Court do anything. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=356.32s)]
*  Anything. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=360.08s)]
*  They are in total control of the cases they accept, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=361.28s)]
*  the issues they agree to decide, and how they've designed those issues. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=365.76s)]
*  But in order to persuade them to do something, they've got to take my case. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=370.88s)]
*  And the best case for them to agree to decide is one that gives them options. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=376.56s)]
*  And if they're willing, they can go big. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=382.72s)]
*  In this episode, the master planners go big. Really big. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=386.96000000000004s)]
*  When we last left off, justices John Roberts and Sam Alito [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=391.44000000000005s)]
*  had just replaced Sandra Day O'Connor and William Rehnquist on the Supreme Court. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, with that new court in the late 2000s, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=400.48s)]
*  James Bopp saw an opportunity to destroy decades of campaign finance laws in a single blow, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=403.6s)]
*  using an obscure film about Hillary Clinton. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=410.24s)]
*  If you thought you knew everything about Hillary Clinton, wait till you see the movie. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=413.92s)]
*  But to win his case, Bopp needed to secure a vote [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=418.48s)]
*  from one of the most inscrutable and powerful men in America, Justice Anthony Kennedy. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=421.76s)]
*  Justice Kennedy has really kind of held the keys to all of these major decisions. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=427.76s)]
*  And so there hasn't really been another swing vote like him. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=432.56s)]
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Masterplan. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=434.88s)]
*  What about the master plan? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=440.72s)]
*  Young Anthony Kennedy's life started in the non-glitzy, non-LA part of California. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  Won't you join us for a trip? A trip depicting life in Sacramento in 1950. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=470.88s)]
*  Like the fictional Hill Valley from Back to the Future, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=476.40000000000003s)]
*  Sacramento in the mid-20th century was bustling an all-white picket fancy. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=479.44s)]
*  Many words have been written about tree-lined streets, beautiful architecture, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=484.88s)]
*  majestic buildings, but nowhere in the world do they fit any better than they do in Sacramento. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=489.28000000000003s)]
*  But underneath the idyllic charm, Sacramento was also California's version of the swamp. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=494.08s)]
*  As the state capital, it was teeming with lobbyists and politicians and their dirty money [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=500.24s)]
*  greasing deals over everything from oil and water to redevelopment and liquor. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=505.12s)]
*  I imagine the city's ethos was like that line in Chinatown. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=510.56s)]
*  Politicians, ugly buildings, and whores all get respectable if they last long enough. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=514.08s)]
*  Anthony Kennedy was born into this swampy culture. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=518.5600000000001s)]
*  His dad was a powerful lawyer and lobbyist who focused on the state legislature, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=521.84s)]
*  running a reliable business of influence peddling and soft corruption. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=526.4s)]
*  In 1963, his father died of a heart attack and young Anthony took over the firm. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=530.32s)]
*  He was only 27 years old. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=536.0s)]
*  As a lobbyist, Kennedy soon became known for handing out campaign money to legislators [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=538.24s)]
*  on behalf of his clients. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=543.52s)]
*  He worked alongside Ed Meese, a master planner we've mentioned a few times before, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=545.12s)]
*  who had a close relationship with that B-movie actor from the Man Meets Monkey film, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=549.84s)]
*  Bedtime for Bonzo. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=554.88s)]
*  Even a monkey brought up in the right surroundings can learn the meaning of decency and honesty. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=556.08s)]
*  Of course, by the early 1970s, that same actor was the Arch-Conservative Governor of California, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=559.68s)]
*  Ronald Reagan. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=566.0799999999999s)]
*  And so while the U.S. Chamber of Commerce was holding its secret meetings about implementing [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=567.1999999999999s)]
*  the Powell Memo in 1973, the Chamber's California state branch was doing its part [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=571.68s)]
*  to put the memo's ideology into action, backing Governor Reagan's major anti-tax ballot measure, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=577.8399999999999s)]
*  which it billed in Powell-Memo-esque terms as an economic bill of rights. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=584.56s)]
*  Who helped Reagan draft that ballot measure? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=589.52s)]
*  Anthony Kennedy. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=592.24s)]
*  It is the most revolutionary and complicated tax reform ever to be submitted to a vote of the people. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=593.36s)]
*  Proposition 1 would cut state income taxes, making them a little smaller each year. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  It would put a constitutional limit on state spending, allowing increases only as the total [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=606.16s)]
*  personal taxable income in California rises. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=612.24s)]
*  The tax proposition ultimately failed by hundreds of thousands of votes. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=615.2s)]
*  But Reagan soon helped his pal Kennedy by getting President Gerald Ford to appoint him [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=619.44s)]
*  to a federal judgeship. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=624.4000000000001s)]
*  Kennedy was just 38 years old when he was appointed to the bench, making him the youngest [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=626.0s)]
*  federal appellate judge in the country. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=631.12s)]
*  Right away, Kennedy forged a reputation as mild-mannered and polite. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=633.2800000000001s)]
*  Some might even say genteel. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  He was a conservative, yes, but not necessarily a predictable or totally ideological one. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=639.68s)]
*  He had a reputation for supporting individual freedoms, read like a libertarian, and making [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=645.52s)]
*  narrow decisions on a case-by-case basis, rather than issuing sweeping ideological rulings. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=651.04s)]
*  And he kept that up into the late 1980s, coming to be known as the leader of a conservative minority [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=657.28s)]
*  on California's more liberal Ninth Circuit. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=663.52s)]
*  And then, in June 1987, journalist Bill Moyers asked the OG master planner, U.S. Supreme [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=666.48s)]
*  Court Justice Lewis Powell, how much longer he would remain on the court. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=674.08s)]
*  You've been here now 15 years. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=678.1600000000001s)]
*  You're 80 years old. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=679.9200000000001s)]
*  Any thought about retiring? [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=681.2800000000001s)]
*  My health has not been good. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=682.96s)]
*  I go to the Mayo Clinic with some frequency, but at the moment I have no present plans. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=684.8000000000001s)]
*  But then, literally the next day... [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=689.9200000000001s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=692.24s)]
*  Justice Lewis Powell, a courtly Southerner, surprised almost everyone today by announcing [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=693.04s)]
*  his retirement from the U.S. Supreme Court. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=697.84s)]
*  His decision touched off a flurry of speculation on who the president will appoint as a replacement [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=700.08s)]
*  and how that will affect the direction of the court and, of course, the country. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=705.36s)]
*  That meant Anthony Kennedy's old pal from Sacramento, now President Ronald Reagan, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=709.12s)]
*  suddenly had a chance to nominate a new Supreme Court Justice. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=714.72s)]
*  Want to guess who Reagan first picked to fill Lewis Powell's seat? [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=718.88s)]
*  Nope, not Anthony Kennedy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=723.12s)]
*  Reagan first went for the A-lister of the master plan cinematic universe, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=725.28s)]
*  the one, the only, Robert Bork. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=730.16s)]
*  Yep, that's the same Robert Bork who did Nixon's dirty work [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=734.56s)]
*  and who helped Gerald Ford get the Buckley v. Valeo ruling. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=738.16s)]
*  As you also heard a few episodes ago, when Reagan nominated the Rasputin-like Bork to [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=741.6s)]
*  the Supreme Court, Senate Democrats fought back. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=746.72s)]
*  We told you that Bork got Borked, but we didn't tell you what happened next. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=750.0s)]
*  When Bork was voted down, Reagan's second choice was Douglas Ginsburg. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=755.2s)]
*  Ginsburg had led the Reagan White House's deregulation agenda. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  He'd hobbled antitrust enforcement at the Justice Department, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=763.76s)]
*  and he had just made an appearance at a Federalist Society event. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=767.2s)]
*  I mean, he was no Robert Bork, but he was a pretty perfect master plan pick, right? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=770.64s)]
*  Well, almost. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=776.16s)]
*  Ginsburg was forced to withdraw from consideration in a very 1980s scandal. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=778.16s)]
*  Several conservative Republicans had urged President Reagan to withdraw [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=783.84s)]
*  Ginsburg nomination after he disclosed he smoked marijuana in the 60s and 70s. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=787.2s)]
*  Listen, I remember this happening when I was a kid. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=795.04s)]
*  Who smoked weed and when was a huge deal back then. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=798.24s)]
*  So Ginsburg got Borked too. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=802.08s)]
*  Months after Powell's retirement, Reagan, just like Nixon in the early 1970s, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=804.16s)]
*  was 0 for 2 in Supreme Court nominees. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=809.36s)]
*  And just like Nixon with Powell back then, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=812.48s)]
*  Reagan now needed to find a jurist who was conservative enough to get nominated, [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=815.28s)]
*  but who presented as liberal and reasonable enough to get confirmed. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=820.24s)]
*  And so Reagan turned to his old Sacramento buddy, Anthony Kennedy. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=824.8s)]
*  Are you upset that you are in effect the third choice for this seat? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=829.04s)]
*  I'm delighted with this nomination. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, why didn't you nominate Judge Kennedy the first time? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=836.48s)]
*  I have told you that all three, we came down to a final three, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=841.12s)]
*  and that all three were so close and so well qualified, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=845.1999999999999s)]
*  that you could have almost thrown a dart right by that decision. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=849.68s)]
*  Right away, Kennedy was seen as the nice guy alternative to the hard-edged Bork [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=853.36s)]
*  and the pothead Ginsburg. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=858.24s)]
*  During his confirmation hearing, Kennedy's past career in Sacramento's influence peddling industry [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=865.84s)]
*  wasn't seen as a liability at all. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=871.36s)]
*  In fact, Republican senators like Orrin Hatch seemed thrilled that Kennedy had experience [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=874.16s)]
*  as both an attorney and a corporate lobbyist. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=879.76s)]
*  Here's Hatch at Kennedy's confirmation hearing. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=882.64s)]
*  Well, I see you as a person with your experience, both as an eminent lawyer, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=885.36s)]
*  as a person who has worked as a lobbyist, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=890.5600000000001s)]
*  as a person who might have a great deal of ability on that court to bring consensus about. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=894.32s)]
*  Democrats this time offered literally zero opposition to Reagan's Supreme Court nominee. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=899.28s)]
*  Kennedy was unanimously confirmed on February 3, 1988. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=904.96s)]
*  Judge and now Justice Kennedy. Sounds good, doesn't it? [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=909.76s)]
*  Takes a distinguished seat on the high bench. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=916.0s)]
*  At Kennedy's swearing-in ceremony, Reagan made sure to draw parallels between Kennedy [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  and the man he was replacing on the bench. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=924.4s)]
*  One of the great gentlemen of the American judiciary, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=926.64s)]
*  a justice widely acclaimed for his decency and fairness, Justice Louis Powell. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=929.52s)]
*  Like his distinguished predecessor, just- [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=934.32s)]
*  That may have sounded placating to liberals, but in retrospect, [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=936.32s)]
*  it must have been reassuring to the master planners. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=940.32s)]
*  Upon joining the court, Kennedy started to build a moderate profile on social issues. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  Notably, in 1992, he co-authored an opinion that reaffirmed Roe v. Wade. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=948.96s)]
*  But he also opted to uphold some abortion restrictions. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=954.96s)]
*  Meanwhile, for those paying close attention, Anthony Kennedy, the former corporate lobbyist, [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=959.44s)]
*  also started dog whistling to the master planners about corruption and campaign finance. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=965.6800000000001s)]
*  He voted against and wrote the dissent in a 1990 case that upheld the state law preventing [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=971.44s)]
*  corporations from using their funds to support political campaigns. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  He voted to let political parties make unlimited expenditures to buy elections [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=982.0s)]
*  for their congressional candidates as long as they didn't directly coordinate with those candidates. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=986.64s)]
*  And Kennedy voted against upholding certain provisions of the McCain-Feingold campaign [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=992.08s)]
*  finance law in that case you heard about in episode 6. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=997.52s)]
*  But mostly for his first 17 years on the court, Kennedy was kind of a backbencher. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1001.68s)]
*  You just didn't hear a ton about him. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1006.48s)]
*  That all changed, though, when Sandra Day O'Connor and William Rehnquist were replaced by John [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1008.72s)]
*  Roberts and Sam Alito. All of a sudden, Anthony Kennedy became one of the most powerful men in [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1014.56s)]
*  America, able to instantly shift national policy on any issue that came before the high court. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1020.88s)]
*  With four liberal justices and four conservatives on the Supreme Court, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1027.52s)]
*  Justice Anthony Kennedy's swing vote will be key. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1031.44s)]
*  A moderate conservative whose votes on high-stakes cases are close to impossible to predict. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1034.8s)]
*  He's the man in the middle, the right-leaning justice who often swings left on some of the [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1040.32s)]
*  most hot-button cases. After the Roberts-Alito Supreme Court takeover, Kennedy's rulings with [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1044.4s)]
*  liberal justices on LGBTQ issues, habeas corpus, abortion rights, they probably made it seem like [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1050.0s)]
*  he'd keep the court from going too far to the right. But conservatives knew that Kennedy's [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1056.88s)]
*  vote could be swung, so they began lining up to throw all kinds of cases at him and the new [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1061.6000000000001s)]
*  conservative majority on the court, like kids lining up to see Santa Claus. But as they say [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1067.2800000000002s)]
*  in Christmas Story, the line waiting to see Santa Claus stretched all the way back to Terre Haute. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1072.8000000000002s)]
*  Back at his storefront office in Terre Haute, Indiana, James Bopp had his eye on deregulating [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1078.3200000000002s)]
*  the campaign finance system, a cause that Kennedy seemed especially amenable to. So Bopp elbowed [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1084.32s)]
*  his way to the front of the queue with a case that brought his two pet causes together, the crusade [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1090.8799999999999s)]
*  against abortion and the crusade to deregulate campaign finance laws. James Bopp saw a new [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1096.48s)]
*  chance to try to go big. It was absolutely critical. Bopp is talking about FEC v Wisconsin [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1106.8s)]
*  Right to Life, a Supreme Court case that was heard right after John Roberts and Sam Alito were [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1114.0s)]
*  installed, right when Anthony Kennedy was the new swing vote. Wisconsin Right to Life contacts me [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1119.68s)]
*  and says that there's an upcoming vote on Bush's judicial nominees. Feingold of McCain Feingold [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1126.0s)]
*  is up for election and we want to lobby him and the vote's going to be in September. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1134.24s)]
*  The special interest anti-abortion group Wisconsin Right to Life is now airing this TV spot. There [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1140.8799999999999s)]
*  are a lot of judicial nominees out there who can't go to work. But come this weekend, this ad and [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1146.8s)]
*  corresponding radio hits will be illegal. Why? Because who Wisconsin Right to Life or WRTL talks [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1151.84s)]
*  about in its ad? Contact Senators Feingold and Cole and tell them to oppose the filibuster. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1159.04s)]
*  Those Wisconsin Right to Life ads fell within the 60-day window or blackout period before that year's [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1163.76s)]
*  general election, which made it subject to the restrictions of the McCain-Feingold campaign [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1170.3999999999999s)]
*  finance law, which, as you heard before, had been upheld by the pre-Roberts, pre-Alito Supreme Court. [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1176.0s)]
*  Under that law, the group couldn't mention Senator Feingold by name because that would [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1184.0s)]
*  be considered electioneering. So Bopp sued on the grounds that those restrictions were a violation [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1189.12s)]
*  of free speech. On April 25, 2007, James Bopp argued that case in front of the Roberts and Alito [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1195.76s)]
*  Supreme Court. The questioning focused on whether the Wisconsin Right to Life ads were just issue [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1203.68s)]
*  ads designed to lobby or whether they were a stealthy form of electioneering against the [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1209.84s)]
*  candidate in the election. Here's Justice Stevens questioning Bopp about the distinction. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1215.84s)]
*  Then Anthony Kennedy chimed in. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1239.84s)]
*  Ultimately, the conservative majority on the court, including the key swing vote, Anthony Kennedy, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1260.0s)]
*  narrowly agreed with Bopp, saying that Wisconsin Right to Life's ads were not express political [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1272.4s)]
*  advocacy since they didn't literally tell people whether or not to vote for specific candidates. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1278.48s)]
*  The court declared that Wisconsin Right to Life's ads could not be regulated by the McCain-Feingold [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1284.64s)]
*  campaign finance law. Here's Chief Justice John Roberts once again play-acting as a baseball umpire. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1290.8000000000002s)]
*  Discussion of issues cannot be suppressed simply because the issues may also be pertinent in an [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  election. Where the First Amendment is implicated, the tie goes to the speaker, not the censor. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1302.0s)]
*  Put another way, a mere four years after the old Rehnquist court dunked on the master planners and [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1308.16s)]
*  upheld McCain's campaign finance law, the new Roberts court had just sided with those same [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1314.16s)]
*  master planners and overturned a major part of that law. This was an empire strikes back moment for the ages. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1320.24s)]
*  I call that the magic words case. This is Senator Sheldon Whitehouse. Whitehouse first took his [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1332.8000000000002s)]
*  seat as the junior senator from Rhode Island just six months before the decision in FEC versus [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1340.08s)]
*  Wisconsin Right to Life came down. He told us just how significant this little noticed case really was. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1346.0s)]
*  That was the case in which the Supreme Court decided what the magic words were that if you [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1352.6399999999999s)]
*  used them in an ad, it became a political ad and was subject to a variety of regulations and limitations. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1359.52s)]
*  But if you didn't use those magic words, then you could say that your ad was not a political ad, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1366.96s)]
*  but it was issue advocacy. You weren't recommending a vote against Senator Whitehouse. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1374.56s)]
*  You were just recommending that voters call up Senator Whitehouse and ask why he was a thieving, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1379.2s)]
*  dirty, puppy-hating, anti-American scoundrel, right? The effect on the airwaves is the same. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1384.08s)]
*  But if you didn't use the magic words about vote or elect, then this whole situation was a [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1390.24s)]
*  whole new avenue opened up for dirty political TV advertising. Whitehouse said that the little [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1396.72s)]
*  magic words loophole started opening up the floodgates for unregulated anonymous dark money ads [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1404.48s)]
*  that buy elections, all under the guise of educating the public with so-called issue ads [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1411.1200000000001s)]
*  rather than electioneering. I think that was the purpose of the exercise. Here are the words that [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1417.68s)]
*  if you don't use them, you're good to go on election spending. So you can see why James [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1423.12s)]
*  Bopp told us that the decision in FEC versus Wisconsin Right to Life was absolutely critical. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1429.04s)]
*  It was a huge blow to the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. But perhaps more importantly, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1436.0s)]
*  it showed Bopp how this new Roberts Alito court was inclined to rule on all of these campaign [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1442.8s)]
*  finance issues. Bopp also noticed something else. Arch-Conservative Justice Antonin Scalia [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1450.0s)]
*  wrote a concurrence agreeing with the court's decision, but saying it should have gone a step [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1456.64s)]
*  further and completely eliminated McCain-Feingold's prohibitions against unlimited corporate [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1462.0s)]
*  spending to sway elections. The concurrence was backed by Clarence Thomas, hardly a surprise. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1468.32s)]
*  But there was a third signature on the document. You guessed it, Anthony Kennedy. That was a signal [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1475.28s)]
*  to James Bopp that perhaps he could get Kennedy, the old Sacramento swamp thing, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1482.0s)]
*  to channel his predecessor Lewis Powell and go huge. I announced today that I'm forming a [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1487.84s)]
*  presidential exploratory committee. I'm not just starting a campaign though. I'm beginning a [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1494.24s)]
*  conversation with you, with America. It's early 2007. Hillary Clinton has announced her campaign [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1498.8s)]
*  for president. James Bopp is in Terre Haute working on arguments that might get justices to go big [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1505.76s)]
*  in that Wisconsin Right to Life case. So let the conversation begin. I have a feeling it's going [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1512.08s)]
*  to be very interesting. And then one day, James Bopp's phone rings. So I'm sitting in my office [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1517.36s)]
*  and I get a phone call from David Bossie. David Bossie is a conservative activist. In 1992, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1523.6s)]
*  he was working for a nonprofit that was first founded by the same people who made one of the [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1532.0s)]
*  sleaziest dark money ads in American history, the Willie Horton ad that shifted the 1988 presidential [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1536.8799999999999s)]
*  election that you heard about in episode six. By 2000, Bossie was the organization's president. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1544.08s)]
*  So James Bopp picks up the phone to talk to David Bossie. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1551.2800000000002s)]
*  And Bossie asks Bopp if he'd represent his organization in a juicy lawsuit about Hillary [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1557.1200000000001s)]
*  Clinton that could end up letting corporations spend unlimited amounts of money in politics. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1563.2800000000002s)]
*  James Bopp likes big campaign finance cases, and this one might be the biggest of them all. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1572.4s)]
*  And he said, I'm working on a movie called Hillary the Movie. All right. And this is now [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1578.8799999999999s)]
*  early in 2007. I'm working on a movie and she's running for president. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1586.3999999999999s)]
*  Hillary the Movie was promoted by Bossie as a documentary, but it was functionally just a [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1591.44s)]
*  hyper conservative 90 minute anti Clinton campaign ad with sad, scary music, all funded by a boatload [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1597.12s)]
*  of anonymous money. She's deceitful. She'll make up any story, lie about anything as long as it [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1604.88s)]
*  serves her purpose at the moment. And the American people are going to catch on to it. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1610.64s)]
*  I can't think of any other politician in history who has shown such a disrespect and a contempt for [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1615.2800000000002s)]
*  the constitution and the rule of law as Hillary. So Bossie was calling Bopp to figure out how to [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  drop this thing into the 2008 election cycle while skirting campaign finance laws that apply [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1628.96s)]
*  to political ads during elections. I want to broadcast this movie and I need your help two ways. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  Okay. First way is to make sure that our movie script does not have an appeal to vote for or [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1641.52s)]
*  against a candidate because I want to be able to do this. And if it has an appeal to vote, [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1649.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm prohibited. So I want you to give me the advice to make sure that they could still do this [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1655.28s)]
*  movie. The second thing Bossie wanted Bob's help on was finding a legal way to get around the [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1662.8s)]
*  requirement to file a disclosure report about who exactly was funding the project. The report would [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1668.24s)]
*  have required him to reveal his donors and people would not want to contribute if they are going to [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1674.56s)]
*  be outed as funding an anti-Hillary, certainly critical of the Hillary movie. So he doesn't want [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1681.68s)]
*  to have to do this report of their donors. This is something we've seen over and over again in [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1690.24s)]
*  our reporting. Conservatives want to be able to broadcast whatever messages they want, but they [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1696.3200000000002s)]
*  don't want to have to admit who is actually funding the message. And this quote unquote movie was [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1702.48s)]
*  pretty nasty. I knew Richard Nixon and I'll tell you something, she's no Richard Nixon, she's worse. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1709.28s)]
*  Ruthless, vindictive, venal, sneaky, ideological, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1716.48s)]
*  intolerant, liar is a good one, scares the hell out of me. So Bob took the lessons he learned in [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1723.2s)]
*  the Wisconsin case and he set about strategically assembling this new case using arguments that [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1729.52s)]
*  Roberts and Scalia and Kennedy had signaled they were sympathetic to. And just like his inspiration [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1735.76s)]
*  Thurgood Marshall in Brown v. Board of Education, James Bob hoped this case would be the big one. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1742.32s)]
*  Bossy's organization had run into issues with federal election regulators in the past. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1749.36s)]
*  They tried to make some so-called documentaries before, but the Dark Money Group was clearly a [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1754.08s)]
*  political organization and not a movie studio. So more than once, the Federal Election Commission [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1760.0s)]
*  insisted that they were subject to McCain-Feingold's restrictions. Bob anticipated a similar pushback on [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1766.32s)]
*  Hillary the movie, but rather than waiting for federal election regulators to send a cease and [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1773.28s)]
*  desist letter to Bossy, Bob had a genius idea. He went to a lower court demanding a declaratory [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1778.56s)]
*  judgment upfront, one that would officially allow Bossy to air his documentary right up until the [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1786.32s)]
*  2008 primaries. In other words, Bob took a play out of the Powell memo and used this case as a [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1792.56s)]
*  preemptive attack. The greatest care should be exercised in selecting the cases in which to [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1799.6799999999998s)]
*  participate. He used this obscure movie to create a case out of thin air. The lower court said, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1806.08s)]
*  essentially, no. Campaign finance restrictions obviously apply to this, but that ruling gave Bob [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1813.52s)]
*  what he really wanted, a way to appeal the case up to John Roberts, Sam Alito, and Anthony Kennedy [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1820.48s)]
*  on the Supreme Court. When Hillary the movie became a legal case, it ended up being named after Bossy's [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1827.6s)]
*  non-movie studio non-profit. Maybe you've heard of it. The Citizens United case. Citizens United. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1834.4s)]
*  Citizens United. Get rid of Citizens United and its pernicious effects on our electoral system. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1841.12s)]
*  Citizens United was appealed up to the Supreme Court in August of 2008. Hillary Clinton was [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1849.04s)]
*  long gone from the presidential race, defeated by Barack Obama. But that didn't matter. The master [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1854.9599999999998s)]
*  planners were after something much bigger. The court agreed to hear the case three months later, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1860.9599999999998s)]
*  and then David Bossy replaced James Bopp. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1866.56s)]
*  Bossy bumped Bopp for a new hot shot attorney named Ted Olson. By 2008, Olson was already famous [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1875.28s)]
*  in master plan circles. He'd been a founding member of the Federalist Society and the Bush [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1882.24s)]
*  campaign's mouthpiece at the Supreme Court in Bush v. Gore, which decided the 2000 election. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1887.12s)]
*  Supposedly, David Bossy had seen Olson win a Republican Lawyer of the Year award at an event [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1893.04s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. in October 2008, where another attorney called Olson the, quote, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1898.96s)]
*  winningest Supreme Court lawyer. So when Bossy's challenge was accepted at the high court the [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1904.48s)]
*  following month, he told his co-founder that they should ditch old James Bopp and Tara Hote [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1909.68s)]
*  and pick up Olson instead, like leaving prom with the popular girl. When Olson took over the [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1915.28s)]
*  Citizens United case, he slightly reformulated Bopp's argument. He focused on the idea that [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1921.12s)]
*  Hillary the movie was not what the McCain-Feingold campaign finance law was actually supposed to [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1927.04s)]
*  prohibit. It was a documentary movie that viewers had to seek out on video on demand, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1932.7199999999998s)]
*  not a screeching election ad that couldn't be avoided on cable TV. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1938.9599999999998s)]
*  It was Olson who first brought up the word corruption. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1951.12s)]
*  Olson argued with a straight face that Hillary the movie wasn't an election-focused ad governed [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1981.12s)]
*  by campaign finance laws, despite the fact that it was dropped in the middle of an election [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=1997.9199999999998s)]
*  and spends 90 minutes insisting that Hillary Clinton was unqualified for the presidency and [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2003.28s)]
*  was, I'm paraphrasing here, basically the Antichrist. Justice Souter, for one, wasn't buying it. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2008.8s)]
*  I mean, this sounds to me like campaign advocacy. Yeah, you think? In response, the master planners [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2038.8s)]
*  on the Supreme Court pretty much hijacked the oral arguments the same way your crotchety uncle [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  pulls the well-actually move to steer the Thanksgiving dinner conversation towards his [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2050.08s)]
*  bizarre theories. For example, instead of a discussion about money, influence, election [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2055.2s)]
*  buying, and corruption, what the case was actually about, Justice Sam Alito forced the government's [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2060.8s)]
*  defense lawyer into an absurd debate about book banning. Here's Kennedy. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2067.36s)]
*  Suppose that we're an advocacy organization that had a book. Your position is that under the Constitution, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2072.1600000000003s)]
*  the advertising for this book or the sale for the book itself could be prohibited within the 60, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2078.56s)]
*  the 30-day period. If the book contained the functional equivalent of express advocacy, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2083.44s)]
*  that is, if it was subject to no reasonable interpretation... They proceeded to get into [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2087.92s)]
*  an even more ludicrous debate about e-books that are accessed via satellite. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2092.96s)]
*  Within the 60, 30-day period, if it comes from a satellite, it can be prohibited under the [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2098.48s)]
*  Constitution and perhaps under this statute. I mean, this is a case about a movie. What are [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2104.0s)]
*  they even talking about? I feel like I'm Steve Martin in planes, trains, and automobiles. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2108.32s)]
*  When you're telling these little stories, here's a good idea. Have a point. It makes it so much [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2113.04s)]
*  more interesting for the listener. The FEC's lawyer tried to steer the justices back on track. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2117.84s)]
*  It can't be prohibited, but a corporation could be barred from using its general treasury funds [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2122.96s)]
*  to publish the book. It could be required to raise funds to publish the book using its pack. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2128.2400000000002s)]
*  That was the actual point. And unfortunately, the FEC's lawyer didn't make it very well. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2133.6000000000004s)]
*  It wasn't really about whether the government could or would prohibit the publication of a book [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2139.6000000000004s)]
*  that urged its readers to vote or not vote for a specific candidate. It was about a corporation [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2144.96s)]
*  being able to anonymously funnel money from its coffers into election communications with no [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2151.12s)]
*  restrictions. And the government was arguing that they'd have to use a regulated pack or explicitly [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2157.28s)]
*  disclosed political money instead. It's worth reiterating that none of this is what the original [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2163.6s)]
*  case was asking about. But as the ever more twisted and deranged arguments went on, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2169.44s)]
*  the conservative justices like Anthony Kennedy kept insisting that it was a free speech question, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2175.04s)]
*  even though it really wasn't. Then an hour later, it was over. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2181.44s)]
*  Thank you, counsel. The case is submitted. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2186.0s)]
*  What happens behind the scenes when the justices vote on this case is kind of my favorite part of [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2189.28s)]
*  the story. This is producer Ula Culpa to tell us about when things got really interesting. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2193.76s)]
*  So after oral argument, the justices meet in private and have a round of initial votes on the [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2198.88s)]
*  case. It falls basically along ideological lines with the four liberals against Citizens United [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2203.6s)]
*  and the five conservatives, including Anthony Kennedy, in favor of saying that McCain Feingold, [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2208.8s)]
*  Bicra, did not apply to Hillary the movie. Roberts gets to work on a narrow opinion saying that, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2213.76s)]
*  but Kennedy writes a concurrence that argues that they should go way bigger and invalidate [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2220.08s)]
*  any campaign finance restrictions on allegedly independent political groups like Citizens United. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2225.04s)]
*  So Roberts and the other conservatives then compare drafts. And they love Kennedy's idea [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2230.16s)]
*  so much that Roberts withdraws his more narrow opinion and lets Kennedy write the majority. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2236.8s)]
*  Exactly. And this is where the drama hits. After Justice Souter sees what Roberts and Kennedy are [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2242.8s)]
*  planning to do, he gets pissed and writes a dissent. And it has become infamous in legal circles [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2248.48s)]
*  because it was this full tilt, bridge burning attack on the logic of his fellow justices, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2254.32s)]
*  which is something that almost never happens and definitely not like this. Reportedly, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2259.6000000000004s)]
*  Souter berated not only the conclusions that Roberts and Kennedy had come to, but the like, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2264.1600000000003s)]
*  intellectual depravity to step outside of and way beyond what this case was asking in the first place. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2268.96s)]
*  Finally, someone was calling bullshit. Okay, so read us some excerpts. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2275.04s)]
*  Well, I can't. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2279.36s)]
*  Wait, why? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2280.32s)]
*  Because very few people have actually ever seen Souter's dissent. And that's because not long [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2281.04s)]
*  after he drafted it, justice David Souter has informed the White House he will retire at the [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2286.96s)]
*  end of a Supreme Court term in June. God, it's exactly like that scene from Half Baked. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2291.6s)]
*  Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. You're cool. And fuck you. I'm out. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2297.2799999999997s)]
*  Totally. And then John Roberts basically makes sure Souter's dissent never gets published as part [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2303.84s)]
*  of the official record. Because instead of the ruling coming out at the end of the court's term, [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2312.16s)]
*  like you might expect, Citizens United is suddenly scheduled for re-argument in the fall. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2316.8s)]
*  What the hell is re-argument? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2322.24s)]
*  It's when the court asks the lawyers to write all new briefs about all new questions. In this case, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2324.16s)]
*  Roberts asked them to address big constitutional questions that signaled that the court wasn't [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2329.36s)]
*  going to issue a narrow ruling about one movie. It was going to follow Kennedy's lead and go [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2333.76s)]
*  really, really big. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2338.7200000000003s)]
*  So here we are in the fall of 2009. Things still seem all hopey and changey over in the White House. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2340.1600000000003s)]
*  But only a few blocks away at the Supreme Court, shit is about to go down. The master planners had [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2347.36s)]
*  taken over the court with Roberts and Alito. James Bopp had given Anthony Kennedy the chance [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2353.84s)]
*  to go big. And Roberts figures out a way to make it all happen. This is like the master planner's [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2359.36s)]
*  A-Team moment. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2365.52s)]
*  I love it when a plan comes together. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2366.48s)]
*  So six months after the first argument in the Citizens United case, David Souter is retired. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2368.4s)]
*  His barn-burning warning about the end of democracy is nowhere to be found. The ideological [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2374.0s)]
*  terminator, John Roberts, rewinds the clock and lets Federalist Society luminary Ted Olson [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2379.84s)]
*  make a whole new argument to the court. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2386.08s)]
*  Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2390.6400000000003s)]
*  This was no longer a little argument about a specific campaign finance law and a dumb documentary. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2393.2000000000003s)]
*  Robust debate about candidates for elective office is the most fundamental value protected by the [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2399.36s)]
*  First Amendment's guarantee of free speech. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2406.4s)]
*  Olson and his client, Citizens United, were now resurrecting the old free speech arguments from [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2409.36s)]
*  Buckley v. Valeo and from Lewis Powell's Bellotti ruling that you heard about in episode five. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2415.1200000000003s)]
*  Essentially, they argued that money is protected speech. They also argued that corporations [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2421.1200000000003s)]
*  therefore have a constitutional right to spend unlimited money in elections as long as it's not [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2427.04s)]
*  directly coordinated by candidates and that such independent spending isn't a corrupting force. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2433.12s)]
*  The justices seemed supportive of that view. John McCain said they seemed totally out of touch with reality. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2440.24s)]
*  I was rather disappointed in some of the justices apparent naivete as to how corporate and union [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2447.52s)]
*  and unlimited money affects the legislative process. Does anyone believe that the rights [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2456.48s)]
*  of average citizens to be heard in Washington would not be overridden by massive campaign, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2462.08s)]
*  unlimited campaign contributions from corporations and unions? [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2469.12s)]
*  McCain was correct. Nobody believed that. But that was a feature of the Citizens United case, [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2474.16s)]
*  not a bug. A ruling in favor of Citizens United would override average citizens' voices and create [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2480.16s)]
*  a society run by corporations and oligarchs, just as James Bopp's fellow Hoosier, Ron Swanson, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2487.44s)]
*  had dreamed of back in fictional small town Indiana. I think that all government is a waste [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2494.32s)]
*  of taxpayer money. My dream is to have the park system privatized and run entirely for profit [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2500.08s)]
*  by corporations like Chuck E. Cheese. They have an impeccable business model. I would rather work for [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2508.4s)]
*  Chuck E. Cheese. McCain, Feingold, and all the reformers warned that ruling for Citizens United [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2514.4s)]
*  would deregulate the campaign finance system and basically make Ron Swanson's vision a reality. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2520.7200000000003s)]
*  Politicians and public officials would work for Chuck E. Cheese and every other corporation, [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2527.04s)]
*  and those corporations would be allowed to buy elections. I mean, the Supreme Court was pretty [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2532.96s)]
*  radical, but would it really go that far? That's after the break. In case 08205, Citizens United [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2539.36s)]
*  versus the FEC, Justice Kennedy has the opinion of the court. On January 21st, 2010, just over four [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2548.08s)]
*  months after the second round of arguments, the decision in Citizens United came down. This time, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2555.84s)]
*  it wasn't Chief Justice John Roberts writing the majority opinion. It was the old Sacramento swamp [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2562.8s)]
*  thing. Former lobbyist and influence peddler Anthony Kennedy. In announcing the decision to [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2569.2s)]
*  the public, Kennedy first laid out why the majority had decided to go big. He identified the precedents [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2575.12s)]
*  that were relevant to the case, like the court's ruling a few years prior that had held up the [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2582.08s)]
*  McCain-Feingold campaign finance law. And then he said, we conclude that those precedents now must [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2587.3599999999997s)]
*  be reexamined. The court has recognized that First Amendment protection extends to corporations. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2593.2s)]
*  If the First Amendment has any force, it prohibits Congress from fining or jailing citizens or [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2599.2s)]
*  associations of citizens for simply engaging in political speech. The precedents the court's [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2604.3999999999996s)]
*  majority was now dismantling, according to Kennedy, would allow the government to ban corporations from [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2609.68s)]
*  expressing political views through any media, including media beyond those presented here. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2614.7999999999997s)]
*  And in this case, such as by printing books, political speech is indispensable to decision [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2620.72s)]
*  making in a democracy. And this is no less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2625.44s)]
*  than an individual. This is the radical corporations or people concept on steroids. And the opinion was [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2630.2400000000002s)]
*  directly built from that Baladi ruling first authored by Kennedy's immediate predecessor, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2637.28s)]
*  Lewis Powell. Even more radical, Anthony Kennedy, who spent his early years as a lobbyist doling out [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2642.96s)]
*  campaign cash to sway legislators, that same Anthony Kennedy was now also insisting that money [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2650.24s)]
*  in politics was only corrupting when there was an explicit quid pro quo. But all the other things [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2657.2s)]
*  that Anthony Kennedy himself had helped his Sacramento lobbying clients use money to buy, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2663.7599999999998s)]
*  stuff like access and influence, that stuff was apparently not corrupting. That sounds like an [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2669.6s)]
*  exaggeration. But in his written opinion, Kennedy asserted that campaign donors, quote, [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2675.84s)]
*  may have influence over or access to elected officials. But that did not, quote, mean that [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2681.6000000000004s)]
*  these officials are corrupt. And then Kennedy wrote something so crazy that hold on, hold on, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2688.0s)]
*  can I get a special effect on my voice for this so that it sounds extra evil? Okay, there we go. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2694.56s)]
*  Kennedy said, quote, independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2700.4s)]
*  do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. I mean, think about how insane that [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2706.48s)]
*  is. Anthony Kennedy non ironically wrote a ruling with the force of law that essentially declares [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2713.84s)]
*  that when a corporation spends $50 million blanketing your state to help one candidate [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2721.44s)]
*  win a U.S. Senate election, there's no corruption or even appearance of corruption when that [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2728.08s)]
*  candidate then does legislative favors for that corporation. Justice Stevens wrote the dissent on [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2735.12s)]
*  behalf of the liberals. It may not have been Souter's barn burner, but it was pretty close. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2741.84s)]
*  It was 90 pages long and probably bolstered by the fact that Stevens was 90 years old and also [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2747.04s)]
*  nearly ready to retire. As one of the joint authors of the opinion in McConnell, [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2753.7599999999998s)]
*  I must emphatically disagree with today's law changing decision. Stevens dissent made the point [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2758.72s)]
*  that up until O'Connor and Rehnquist were replaced by Roberts and Alito, the court had upheld at least [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2764.96s)]
*  some restrictions on corporate spending in elections. The court has the point exactly backwards [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2771.2799999999997s)]
*  At the founding, Americans took it as a given that corporations could be comprehensively [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2777.12s)]
*  regulated in the service of the public welfare. It is doubtful that the framers [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2783.52s)]
*  believed the freedom of speech would extend to corporations who cannot themselves [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2789.24s)]
*  engage in speech, and it is even more doubtful that when they ratified the First [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2795.16s)]
*  Amendment, they thought they were laying down a principle that could be used to insulate [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2800.96s)]
*  from even modest restrictions on electioneering expenditures. After speaking for 20 minutes, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2807.36s)]
*  twice as long as Kennedy had, Stevens had his mic drop moment. While American democracy is still [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2814.32s)]
*  imperfect, few outside the majority of this court would have thought its flaws included a shortage [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2820.32s)]
*  of corporate money in politics. Unsurprisingly, when the ruling came down, David Bossie of [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2827.84s)]
*  Citizens United was giddy. This is a monumental day for Citizens United and more importantly for [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2834.08s)]
*  the First Amendment and the fundamental rights of people to participate in the political process [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2841.36s)]
*  and the marketplace of ideas. Whether you're an individual, whether you're a corporation or a [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2847.04s)]
*  union, it doesn't matter. You can now participate fully and freely in the election process. Here's [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2853.04s)]
*  Senator Sheldon Whitehouse again. My recollection is that I was on the Senate floor and came back to [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2860.2s)]
*  read the decision. He said the decision was painful to read. I live in the immediate political [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2865.3599999999997s)]
*  world and I was watching the Supreme Court buy into a notion about that political world that I [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2872.3999999999996s)]
*  knew to be false. They have applied a conceptual paradigm over politics that is complete and utter [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2878.96s)]
*  nonsense. While much of the country reacted to the decision with surprise and anger, Whitehouse [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2887.6s)]
*  says that conservative must have had an inkling that this was coming because right after the [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2893.2s)]
*  decision came down, conservative and business interest groups immediately filed papers to create [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2897.84s)]
*  scores of unregulated dark money groups that could exploit the ruling. The fact that they had this [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2903.92s)]
*  whole 501c4 apparatus ready to go sort of proved that this was an expected decision. In fact, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2909.92s)]
*  you even have Virginia Thomas setting up her organization while the decision is being [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2918.0s)]
*  deliberated so that on the day it's announced, she's ready to go. Whitehouse is referring to [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2924.2400000000002s)]
*  Virginia Ginny Thomas, wife of Justice Clarence Thomas. Just weeks before the ruling in Citizens [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2930.4s)]
*  United came down, she and Leonard Leo of the Federalist Society filed initial paperwork [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2937.12s)]
*  for a not-for-profit lobbying group called Liberty Central, a group designed to take advantage of the [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2943.2s)]
*  Citizens United ruling. Liberty Central is America's public square. We inspire, we listen, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2949.7599999999998s)]
*  we activate ordinary citizens to secure the blessings of liberty. Though it was hidden at [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2955.84s)]
*  the time, later reporting revealed that Liberty Central's initial $500,000 of funding came from, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2960.8s)]
*  who else, the Thomas's favorite billionaire, a guy named Harlan Crowe who'd been funding lavish trips [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2967.84s)]
*  for Justice Thomas. On the other side of the aisle, Democrats openly criticized the Citizens United [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2975.1200000000003s)]
*  ruling. Here's President Obama in his State of the Union address less than a week after the decision. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2981.04s)]
*  Last week, the Supreme Court reversed a century of law that I believe will open the floodgates [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2986.96s)]
*  for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2992.08s)]
*  election. In the video of the speech, you can see the justices stay seated and look stone-faced as [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=2997.68s)]
*  much of the room stands to applaud Obama around them. And then there's Samuel Alito shaking his [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3004.08s)]
*  head and muttering, not true. It made me grieve for Sandra Day O'Connor, whose departure had opened [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3010.4s)]
*  the door for Alito particularly, and whose common sense and experience as somebody who had run for [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3017.44s)]
*  office, I think, would have headed off Citizens United had she stayed on the court. So the whole [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3023.92s)]
*  thing was just sort of imbued with sorrow and missed chances, but the result at the end was [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3029.6s)]
*  a completely manufactured simulacrum of what the political world is like created by the court [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3037.44s)]
*  and imposed on all of us. White House and John McCain tried to quickly limit the ruling's effects. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3044.88s)]
*  They asked the Supreme Court to at least prevent a lower court in Montana from now using Citizens [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3052.16s)]
*  United to gut that state's hundred-year-old anti-corruption law. The Supreme Court refused [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3058.2400000000002s)]
*  to even hear the case. So at that point, I realized, oh my god, this is not an innocent [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3064.64s)]
*  mistake. They are actually deliberately trying to open our political world to right-wing political dark money. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3071.2799999999997s)]
*  In my imagination, James Bopp was celebrating back home in Indiana when he read the Citizens [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3083.52s)]
*  United ruling. Great job everyone. The reception will be held in each of our individual houses [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3089.44s)]
*  alone. But alas, James Bopp wasn't there. He was actually on the beach. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3094.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't even remember why I was in Florida, but I was I remember very distinctly reading the opinion [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3102.96s)]
*  on on the beach of Florida. Of course, I knew the decision that they'd overturn the two precedents [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3109.12s)]
*  that needed to be overturned. And I do the vote. He was psyched. But if he doesn't sound 100% [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3116.08s)]
*  excited about the ruling, it's because he kind of wasn't. Sure, he had gotten most of what he wanted. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3124.32s)]
*  He had created a case that convinced the court to go huge and eviscerate campaign finance laws [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3131.52s)]
*  in a world-changing ruling. Four years before Citizens United, nonprofits and other non-disclosing [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3137.7599999999998s)]
*  political groups had spent zero dollars in the 2006 election cycle. In 2010, right after the ruling, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3144.48s)]
*  those groups accounted for 47% of political spending, $134 million. But still, there was [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3152.88s)]
*  one part of the Citizens United ruling that stuck in James Bopp's craw. They upheld a report. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3161.84s)]
*  The disclosure. Yeah, the disclosure report. Remember, David Bossie originally asked Bopp [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3168.08s)]
*  to help his group circumvent the McCain-Feingold law and let Citizens United air its glorified [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3174.24s)]
*  anti-Hillary campaign ad in the middle of the election. But Bossie also told Bopp he wanted [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3180.72s)]
*  to ignore the McCain-Feingold law's disclosure provisions and hide the names of the ad's funders [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3186.96s)]
*  from the public. On that disclosure issue, the court actually ruled against Citizens United. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3193.76s)]
*  The court ruled that laws requiring big spenders in elections and politics to be disclosed, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3201.28s)]
*  those laws were constitutional. We reject Citizens United's challenge to the disclaimer and [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3207.28s)]
*  disclosure provisions. Those mechanisms provide information to the electorate. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3212.6400000000003s)]
*  The resulting transparency enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper weight [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3217.76s)]
*  to different speakers and different messages. When he heard this caveat, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3223.04s)]
*  saw an opportunity to call the Supreme Court's bluff. He introduced a bill called the Democracy [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3228.48s)]
*  is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections Act, a hilariously wordy attempt [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3235.36s)]
*  to get a piffy acronym, the Disclose Act. The Disclose Act was originally designed to require [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3242.0s)]
*  that you trace back to the actual source of political contributions for any contribution [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3250.16s)]
*  to a political campaign or a PAC or a super PAC over $10,000 in an individual race. That's not [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3256.3199999999997s)]
*  a whole lot of people, but at that level you really are buying influence and so I think it's [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3264.8799999999997s)]
*  important for voters to understand what's going on in their political world around them. Democrats [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3269.44s)]
*  rallied behind the Disclose Act right away, while Republicans, like Mitch McConnell, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3274.48s)]
*  contorted themselves to swat it down. This Disclose Act is not about reform. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3280.16s)]
*  It's nothing more than Democrats sitting behind closed doors with special interest lobbyists [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3285.28s)]
*  choosing which favored groups they want to speak in the 2010 elections. But McConnell and the other [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  master planners were not satisfied just stopping the Disclose Act in the Senate and walking off [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3296.2400000000002s)]
*  into the sunset with the Citizens United ruling. If your movement's half century goal is to [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3301.68s)]
*  completely deregulate the campaign finance system and legalize the buying of elections so that a [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3307.2s)]
*  handful of anonymous big spenders could completely control politics, what more could you possibly [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3313.44s)]
*  want after Citizens United? Well, one answer to that question is something that was baked into [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3320.3999999999996s)]
*  the Citizens United case by the master planner's favorite justice of all. The guy that we now know [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3326.16s)]
*  was being secretly wined and dined by billionaires, Clarence Thomas. In a concurrence that almost [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3332.3199999999997s)]
*  nobody noticed, Thomas voted for the ruling but said he thought it didn't go far enough. He said, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3339.44s)]
*  wait, wait, hang on. Can I get that evil voice special effect one more time? He wrote, quote, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3346.72s)]
*  So if you're a master planner, maybe after Citizens United, you want to try to do that, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3356.16s)]
*  kill off all disclosure, and maybe you also want to hobble the last remaining campaign finance [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3365.12s)]
*  regulators on the beat. And maybe, just maybe, you want to try to get the government to declare [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3372.0s)]
*  that cash for favors, like actual money for actual political favors, is now completely legal. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3379.2s)]
*  In the day's other news, the U.S. Supreme Court lent a seemingly sympathetic ear to former Virginia [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=64-8AWMDGpE&t=3387.2799999999997s)]
