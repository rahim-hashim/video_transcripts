Video Description: You might remember Mitt Romney’s infamous line: “Corporations are people, my friend.” But where did this idea come from? In this episode: how the Ford Administration and the Powell Memo movement turned to the Supreme Court to establish the precedent that legalized corruption: money is speech, and corporations are entitled to First Amendment rights.

# Episode 5: Corporations Are People, My Friend | Master Plan
**The Master Plan:** [November 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34)
*  My thanks to all of you and now it's on to Chicago and let's win now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator Robert Francis Kennedy died at 1 44 a.m. today June 6 1968. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=6.88s)]
*  We just finished the last episode in the mid 1970s so you might be wondering what are we [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=17.56s)]
*  doing back in 1968 and also what does RFK have to do with a master plan to legalize [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=22.72s)]
*  corruption. Don't worry I'm not going down a rabbit hole of Kennedy [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=29.44s)]
*  conspiracies but stay with me here. You know that whole idea of chaos theory? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=33.64s)]
*  The shorthand is the butterfly effect. A butterfly can flap its wings and be king and in central [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=39.72s)]
*  park you get rain instead of sunshine. Well the death of RFK had cascading effects that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=44.08s)]
*  I don't think even the best politicos could have ever predicted. It was the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=49.400000000000006s)]
*  first flap of the butterflies wings. There were a few huge obvious ripple effects from [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=53.56s)]
*  RFK's assassination. The Democrats nominated Hubert Humphrey in the disastrous 1968 [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  Democratic Convention which led to Richard Nixon getting elected and then of course Watergate. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=65.72s)]
*  But there was another often overlooked consequence a tiny ripple that the master [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=71.48s)]
*  planners capitalized on that's still making waves today. Kennedy's assassination left a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  vacancy in the US Senate which New York's Republican governor Nelson Rockefeller filled [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=83.28s)]
*  with a relatively obscure member of his own party rather than with another Democrat. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=88.8s)]
*  Governor Nelson Rockefeller today named New York Republican Congressman Charles Goodell to the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=93.92s)]
*  Senate seat of the late Robert Kennedy. The term expires in January 1971. Representative [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=98.72s)]
*  Charles Goodell today mostly known as the father of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell but after [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=104.76s)]
*  Kennedy's assassination Goodell was plucked from the House to finish out the late Senator [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=111.12s)]
*  Kennedy's term. Two years later in 1970 Goodell was running for re-election but rather than [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=115.88000000000001s)]
*  towing the Republican Party's line he was a vocal critic of the Nixon administration and the war in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=122.44s)]
*  Vietnam. Not surprisingly this put him on the president's famous enemies list and Nixon's [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=128.52s)]
*  vice president Spiro Agnew went on the attack. Referring to him as part of an awful liberal [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=134.92s)]
*  radical coalition vice president Agnew said today that Goodell stimulates the type of leadership [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  which encourages the dissident element in our society. But the problem for the Nixon White House [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  was that Goodell was their party's candidate and even if they didn't like him did they really want [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=151.11999999999998s)]
*  to lose the seat to the Democrats? Enter the long-shot solution. Not only a better candidate [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  in the short run but also a man whose actions and political positions would eventually be [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=163.24s)]
*  incredibly useful to the master planners. Referred to as the other Buckley he is James the older [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=168.96s)]
*  brother of columnist William Buckley. Buckley is a more likely prospect for an upset especially if [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=179.08s)]
*  the liberal vote splits. It would provide the kind of victory the conservatives would really [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=184.84s)]
*  savor right here in the heartland of the Eastern liberal establishment. James Buckley became the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=189.56s)]
*  nominee of the Conservative Party of New York. He was a long-shot third-party candidate with a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=195.12s)]
*  populist message. Isn't it about time we had a senator? Right James Buckley man of the people [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=200.72s)]
*  and by the people I mean all us descendants of rich oil families. James L Buckley for senator. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=207.96s)]
*  Here was an opportunity for the nascent conservative movement to gain a foothold in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=214.4s)]
*  American politics. That first flap of the butterfly's wings led to this candidate at [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=218.88s)]
*  this moment and while Nixon chose at least personally not to endorse any candidate in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=224.48000000000002s)]
*  the three-way Senate race behind the scenes his henchmen and the conservative movement [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=230.24s)]
*  had found a candidate they could bankroll. Vice President Agnew campaigned in New York [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  today against the reelection of one of his own party's candidates senator Charles Goodell [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=240.0s)]
*  whom Agnew is denounced as a radical liberal. Agnew spoke at a fundraising luncheon attended [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=244.32s)]
*  mostly by Republicans backing Conservative Party candidate James Buckley. There were more than a [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=249.64s)]
*  few heavy hitters at that fundraising lunch bankers board chairs businessmen and the former [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=254.68s)]
*  ambassador to Italy. On election night their political machinations paid off. The man who's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=260.16s)]
*  number one is James Buckley brother of columnist William F. He is a lawyer and businessman wealthy [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=268.64s)]
*  and cultivator. He's a minority victor his two liberal opponents got more than 60 percent of [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=273.68s)]
*  the vote between them. James Buckley became the first third party candidate elected to the U.S. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=279.28s)]
*  Senate in three decades. He'd only serve one term losing in 1976 but in that short period of time [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=284.96s)]
*  James Buckley became the perfect vehicle for the master planners playing the earnest outsider the [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=293.12s)]
*  staunchly conservative Buckley looked like a real life Mr. Smith goes to Washington but in 1975 [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=299.6s)]
*  Buckley worked with DC insiders to engineer a lawsuit that would strike the first and perhaps [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=307.04s)]
*  most important blow against America's new campaign finance laws. And the thing about [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=312.88s)]
*  Buckley's lawsuit is it wasn't done under the banner of rank corruption. He and his fellow [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=318.72s)]
*  plaintiffs cast the case as a crusade for free speech and third party rights. To quote Dr. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  Ian Malcolm from Jurassic Park again. A butterfly can flap its wings and be king and in Central [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  Park you get rain instead of sunshine. In this episode we'll show how that first flap of a [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=336.24s)]
*  butterfly's wings RFK's assassination ultimately provided the master planners with an opening [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=340.96000000000004s)]
*  in which they could test the legal ideas laid out in the Powell memo. Along the way we'll give you [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=347.6s)]
*  a rare glimpse behind the scenes of how Supreme Court cases are decided by taking you into the [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  inner sanctum of a notoriously secret branch of government. I'm David Sirota and this is Master Plan. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=359.68s)]
*  Okay back to 1974 about four years after Buckley was elected to the U.S. Senate. As we heard in the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=377.6s)]
*  last couple of episodes Lewis Powell had written his memo. He's now a one-man sleeper cell on the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=400.48s)]
*  Supreme Court. Simultaneously the master planners are hard at work implementing his blueprint for a [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=406.08s)]
*  corporate takeover of American politics. One of the things they need to do to implement Powell's memo [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=412.08s)]
*  is destroy the laws that prevent them and their financial backers from spending unlimited amounts [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=417.52s)]
*  of money to buy elections, politicians, and political power. One set of those laws has just [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=422.79999999999995s)]
*  been reluctantly enacted by President Gerald Ford. In the wake of the Watergate scandal he signed [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=429.03999999999996s)]
*  several amendments to the Federal Election Campaign Act, FICA, and in broad strokes those [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=434.96s)]
*  laws did four things the master planners hated. One is imposing contribution and spending limits. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  One is imposing disclosure requirements. One is creating the Federal Election Commission and one [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=447.44s)]
*  is setting up a system for public financing of presidential but not congressional campaigns. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=453.84s)]
*  That's Rick Hassan. He's a professor of law and political science at UCLA where he also [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=459.52s)]
*  directs the Safeguarding Democracy Project. When Gerald Ford signed the amendment strengthening [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=464.48s)]
*  FICA it was held up as proof that America was moving on from Watergate and cleaning up government. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=469.76s)]
*  But not so fast. While Ford was touting the new law in front of the cameras his White House issued [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=475.92s)]
*  a written statement about FICA that showed how little the administration actually supported the [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=482.56s)]
*  law. The statement from Ford read quote, although I do have reservations about the First Amendment [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=488.08000000000004s)]
*  implications inherent in the limits on individual contributions and candidate expenditures, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=494.24s)]
*  I'm sure that such issues can be resolved in the courts. Hmm it's almost as if that was the plan [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=499.92s)]
*  ever since the meeting about the Powell memo in Disney World back in episode four. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=507.36s)]
*  On January 2nd, 1975 exactly one day after these new FICA amendments went into effect [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=516.72s)]
*  a group of plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in federal court. The first name on this list of plaintiffs [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=523.2s)]
*  was none other than the one, the only, the third party conservative darling Senator James Buckley [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=529.36s)]
*  making the serious charge that FICA was violating the First Amendment. As Rick Hassan told us this [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=536.0s)]
*  case marked a turning point in American law. It's the foundational case for understanding [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=542.5600000000001s)]
*  the Supreme Court's constitutional approach to campaign finance questions. Everything flows from [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=549.52s)]
*  Buckley. The defendant in this case was Francis Vallejo, the first director of the brand new [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=554.48s)]
*  federal election commission created by FICA. Vallejo was just a name. He was just the stand-in [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=560.0s)]
*  representative of the government, but his side was tasked with protecting and upholding FICA. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=565.6s)]
*  The Buckley v. Vallejo case is complicated, but as Rick Hassan explained the central issue was [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=571.36s)]
*  contribution and spending limits. One of the provisions of the law said that a person could [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=577.92s)]
*  not spend more than a thousand dollars to independently support or oppose a candidate for [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=583.28s)]
*  office. So if you were living in a big city and you wanted to take out a big billboard in the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=589.1999999999999s)]
*  1976 election and say vote for Jimmy Carter, that would cost more than a thousand dollars. That would [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=594.88s)]
*  be illegal. Man, I wish we could vote for Jimmy Carter again. Is that an option? Anyway, Buckley [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=600.4799999999999s)]
*  had already taken a vocal stand against FICA in the Senate. In his opinion, those amendments and [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=606.32s)]
*  FICA in general made it harder for third-party candidates like himself to run for office, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  let alone win. And as part of his arguments on the Senate floor, he repeatedly cited a man named [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=618.5600000000001s)]
*  Ralph Winter. Winter is coming. Winter was a law professor at Yale at the time. He'd also co-authored [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  a booklet for the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank. And that booklet made [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=631.12s)]
*  the radical argument that money in politics did not equal corruption and vote buying. It equaled [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=636.8s)]
*  free speech and free expression. In this booklet, he wrote that, quote, setting a limit on candidate [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=643.44s)]
*  expenditures sets a maximum on the political activities in which American citizens can engage [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=650.08s)]
*  and is thus unconstitutional. Of note, the other author on this booklet, a guy by the name of Bolton. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=656.16s)]
*  Michael Bolton? No, not Michael Bolton. John Bolton, the neocon lover of war and former advisor to [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=663.76s)]
*  George W. Bush and Donald Trump, the one with the bushy mustache and the uncanny ability to survive [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=674.16s)]
*  more than 50 years in politics, despite being deeply unpopular with just about everyone. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=679.76s)]
*  Buckley makes Winter and Bolton's free speech arguments central to his case to dismantle the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=685.68s)]
*  new post-Watergate campaign finance laws. And he had an odd assortment of other plaintiffs with him. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=691.2s)]
*  You might have heard the phrase that politics makes strange bedfellows, but honestly, I'm having a hard [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=697.2s)]
*  time thinking of a weirder combination than the group of plaintiffs attached to this lawsuit. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=702.48s)]
*  There's Buckley, of course, but also Senator Eugene McCarthy, the liberal anti-war Democrat who [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=707.84s)]
*  challenged President Johnson in the 1968 presidential primary. Then there was the New York [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=713.6s)]
*  Civil Liberties Union, the Libertarian Party, the Socialist Workers Party, and the Conservative Party [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=718.5600000000001s)]
*  of the state of New York. Conservatives, Libertarians, and Socialists joining forces [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=724.24s)]
*  on the same lawsuit? Dogs and cats living together, mass hysteria. These were the obscure [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=729.76s)]
*  underdogs of the political sphere. But of course, there was a master planner lurking in the background. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=735.2s)]
*  And after hearing about him in the last episode, would it surprise you to learn that Charles Koch [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=741.0400000000001s)]
*  was bankrolling the lawsuit? It sure as shit didn't surprise me. Koch wanted to be able to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=746.72s)]
*  give unlimited money to his presidential candidate of choice, a guy named Roger McBride from the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=752.24s)]
*  brand new anti-government Libertarian Party. I'm not sure Koch had enough money to propel McBride [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=757.84s)]
*  to victory. He won 0.2% of the popular vote and no Electoral College votes. But then McBride went [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=764.0s)]
*  on to create the Little House on the Prairie TV series, so maybe it was a win after all? [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=770.4s)]
*  Anyhow, these plaintiffs didn't see the new post-Watergate campaign finance laws as a way [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=778.24s)]
*  to stop donors from buying votes, elections, and legislation. No, they saw FICA as an unconstitutional [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=783.44s)]
*  assault on donors' right to free speech. Isn't it nice when people can find common ground? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=790.96s)]
*  Here's political science professor Rick Hassan explaining the plaintiff's argument. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=798.0s)]
*  The New York Civil Liberties Union argued that these laws were a form of overreach and provided [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=813.6s)]
*  a way for the government to stifle political speech. Senators Buckley and McCarthy saw the [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=819.44s)]
*  laws as unfairly beneficial to incumbent candidates. They'd both been outsider insurgent [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=824.72s)]
*  candidates, meaning they didn't have the financial support of the two major parties' political [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=830.24s)]
*  machinery. Instead, both men depended on money from wealthy donors to kickstart their campaigns. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=835.12s)]
*  Buckley argued that FICA set such low spending limits that it made it much harder for an unknown [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=841.36s)]
*  outsider candidate like himself to compete. If you want to campaign for office, you want people [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=847.52s)]
*  to vote for you, you're running for Congress, it's going to cost money to do it. If you say [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=852.96s)]
*  that candidates are limited in how much money they can spend or a person is limited how much [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=857.1999999999999s)]
*  money they can contribute for political speech, that certainly affects the rights of speech [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=861.52s)]
*  and association. Despite this argument, the first federal court that heard the case upheld FICA [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=866.0s)]
*  on the grounds that it prevented elections from becoming auctions sold to the highest bidder. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=871.92s)]
*  But the ink was barely dry on that decision when Buckley and his menagerie of plaintiffs appealed [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=877.5200000000001s)]
*  to the Supreme Court, which heard the case on November 10th, 1975, eight days after I was born. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=884.1600000000001s)]
*  Imagine an abnormally warm day just weeks before Thanksgiving. While my mom is taking me home in a [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=891.5200000000001s)]
*  swaddle in New Haven, Connecticut, groups of lawyers, defendants, and plaintiffs made their [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  way up the marble steps, past the statues of the Contemplation of Justice and Authority of Law, [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=902.48s)]
*  through the stately Greco-Roman columns and sculpted bronze doors into the Great Hall of the U.S. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=908.5600000000001s)]
*  Supreme Court. They file into the court chamber and arrange themselves at tables in front of the [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=915.28s)]
*  bench where the justices sit. Chief Justice Warren Burger, a Richard Nixon appointee, presided. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=920.96s)]
*  We'll hear arguments today and Buckley against Galeo and others. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=928.0s)]
*  Counsel, you may proceed whenever you're ready. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=935.8399999999999s)]
*  Arguing first on behalf of Buckley is Ralph Winter, the same man who'd written that booklet [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=938.4s)]
*  about money and speech and the same man that Buckley had cited in his Senate speeches [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=943.68s)]
*  against the FICA amendments. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=948.88s)]
*  The burden of the FECA thus fall heavily on those challenging the status quo. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=950.9599999999999s)]
*  By empowering the ability of challengers both to raise and spend money, this legislation makes it [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=957.28s)]
*  acutely difficult for them to overcome the exposure incumbents already enjoy. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=962.48s)]
*  Money, he's saying, allows candidates to reach their voters. Without it, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=966.88s)]
*  their speech is stifled, which he says is a clear violation of the First Amendment. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=971.4399999999999s)]
*  I don't think there could be any question about this. If there were five restaurants in a town [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=976.88s)]
*  and someone was about to open a new one, an ordinance severely limiting the amount of [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=980.7199999999999s)]
*  newspaper advertising restaurants might buy would be recognized for what it is, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=985.12s)]
*  an attempt by the existing restaurants to freeze out newcomers. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=989.76s)]
*  Arguing the other side in favor of protecting FICA and upholding contribution and expenditure [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=992.96s)]
*  limits was Archibald Cox. Yes, that's the same Archibald Cox who led the Watergate investigation. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=998.72s)]
*  The purposes as we see them are first to protect the honor and integrity of government operations [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1005.84s)]
*  in both the legislative and executive branches against the corrosive influence of large [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1012.88s)]
*  contributions, the pressure to raise large money, and the resulting sense of indebtedness, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1020.48s)]
*  which of course does not affect every contribution, but there appear to have been too many of that [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1028.0s)]
*  character. He's referring, of course, to the literal bags of cash delivered to Nixon's 1972 [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1033.36s)]
*  campaign, the illegal contributions that he prosecuted during Watergate and that we heard [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1039.36s)]
*  about back in episode two. Cox, along with the other lawyers on the government side, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1044.1599999999999s)]
*  pointed out that contributing money to campaigns wasn't protected speech and neither was campaign [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1049.1999999999998s)]
*  spending. They argued that money doesn't buy speech, it buys votes, which is illegal. They [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1054.7199999999998s)]
*  argued that unchecked money in politics caused the kind of corruption that America had just seen [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1061.52s)]
*  during Watergate. It bought votes and influence and government favors and therefore the constitution [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1067.04s)]
*  allowed it to be regulated. Now you just heard me say that Cox was defending FICA on behalf of the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1073.44s)]
*  government, but remember the Ford administration, aka the government, didn't actually like FICA. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1079.12s)]
*  Here's Rick Hassan again. People who are working for the federal government, some of them side [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1086.1599999999999s)]
*  with Buckley and the plaintiffs. Essentially, Ford allowed his henchmen to undermine the defense of [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1090.24s)]
*  the law that they were supposed to be upholding. And in fact, the government ends up filing two [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1096.8s)]
*  briefs in the case. One brief on behalf of the federal election commission that defends the law [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1102.0s)]
*  and then one brief from the solicitor general. The solicitor general, the number three at the [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1107.2s)]
*  department of justice whose main job is to defend government agencies at the supreme court. And at [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1112.1599999999999s)]
*  this moment in time, the solicitor general was Robert Bork. Yes, that Robert Bork, the [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1118.24s)]
*  only guy in the justice department willing to follow Nixon's orders and fire Archibald Cox [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1126.48s)]
*  during Watergate's Saturday night massacre. Now, as Ford's solicitor general in the campaign [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1132.32s)]
*  finance case, this was something of a rematch and Bork was again the hatchet man taking the [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1137.84s)]
*  unprecedented step of filing a brief that says it is not taking a position, but essentially argues [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1144.08s)]
*  that big chunks of the law are unconstitutional. In essence, Bork was winking and nodding to the [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1150.48s)]
*  court telling the justices that, hey, the president signed this so we're technically obligated to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1155.68s)]
*  defend this thing, but really we want you to knock it down. And that's exactly what the court did [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1160.8s)]
*  on January 30th, 1976. At first, the ruling seemed to stand up the new campaign finance law. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1166.72s)]
*  The court holds that the contribution limits do not directly impinge upon the rights of [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1174.48s)]
*  individual citizens and candidates to engage in political debate and discussion. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1180.0s)]
*  But then came the right hook to the face. The court holds that the expenditure limitations [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1187.28s)]
*  are violative of first amendment guarantees and they are unconstitutional. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1194.32s)]
*  Boom, down goes a big part of FICA. Basically, the Supreme Court upheld the contribution limits, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1201.2s)]
*  saying they only imposed a minor restriction on free speech. But the court also said that if the [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1207.44s)]
*  government limited how much money a candidate or a special interest group could spend on something [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1213.68s)]
*  like a billboard or a TV commercial, that was a direct infringement on their ability to communicate. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1218.8s)]
*  So they struck down expenditure limits. This all may seem like some small technicality, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1225.3600000000001s)]
*  but it was huge. James Buckley and his fellow plaintiffs had convinced the United States [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1231.04s)]
*  Supreme Court to agree in part to the master planner's radical argument that money wasn't [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1237.36s)]
*  a tool of corruption that could be regulated. Money was now a form of constitutionally protected [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1243.44s)]
*  speech. This precedent was everything. It would become the cornerstone of the entire master plan, [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1249.76s)]
*  a way to destroy all campaign finance and anti-corruption laws with the blessing of [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1257.04s)]
*  the highest court in the land. Around the same time that the Supreme Court heard arguments in [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1263.12s)]
*  the Buckley v. Valeo case, justices were also dealing with two other cases about the First [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1270.8799999999999s)]
*  Amendment and freedom of speech. These were cases about abortion and drug prices that didn't seem [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1276.96s)]
*  related to campaign finance at all. So let's start with abortion. An alternative newspaper [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1282.64s)]
*  in Charlottesville, Virginia was running advertisements for abortions that were legal [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1291.44s)]
*  in New York but not legal in Virginia. The editor of the newspaper, Jeffrey Bigelow, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1295.68s)]
*  was charged and convicted of advertising abortion services which violated Virginia law. Bigelow's [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1300.96s)]
*  case eventually ended up in front of the Supreme Court in 1975 where he was represented by the ACLU [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1307.6s)]
*  and they argued that the conviction violated the First Amendment. Watching this case very closely [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1314.9599999999998s)]
*  was a guy by the name of Alan Morrison who worked for Ralph Nader's consumer protection group, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1320.7199999999998s)]
*  Public Citizen. Morrison was interested in the Bigelow abortion case because he thought it might [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1326.6399999999999s)]
*  be an opportunity to create a new First Amendment protection. In an interview, he told us that he [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1332.0s)]
*  was arguing for a consumer's right not just to speak but to listen to new information. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1338.16s)]
*  I saw this as a case in which we should file our brief testing the waters on the listener theory. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1343.92s)]
*  So Morrison filed an amicus brief in the abortion case outlining his argument. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1352.56s)]
*  You are depriving listeners, Virginia citizens, who want to go to New York to have an abortion [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1357.84s)]
*  where it's perfectly legal and Virginia has no basis for keeping you out of doing that. Morrison's [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1363.4399999999998s)]
*  brief swayed the opinion of Justice Harry Blackmun who would use this argument when he wrote the [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1368.72s)]
*  Supreme Court's majority opinion. Morrison's goal of creating a new precedent had worked like a [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1374.1599999999999s)]
*  charm. He then turned to the case he was really interested in as a consumer rights attorney, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1380.72s)]
*  a case in which a woman named Lynn Jordan was trying to challenge the laws that prevented [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1386.24s)]
*  pharmacies from advertising prescription drug prices. Jordan had had a hysterectomy and required [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1391.6s)]
*  all kinds of medications but state laws prohibited pharmacies from advertising drug prices on the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1398.0s)]
*  grounds that that kind of advertising would somehow make pharmacists less professional. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1404.72s)]
*  There were about 34 states that had laws like Virginia that forbade the advertising of the [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1410.88s)]
*  price of prescription drugs and the Federal Trade Commission had demonstrated conclusively [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1415.44s)]
*  that the prices of prescription drugs in those states were higher than it was elsewhere. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1420.64s)]
*  So with Morrison's help, Lynn Jordan sued. In this case, the state of Virginia insisted that such [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1424.88s)]
*  laws were allowed because product advertisements were not political speech. They were commercial [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1431.44s)]
*  speech which wasn't protected under the First Amendment. That's where Morrison whipped out the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1437.76s)]
*  recent win in that Bigelow abortion case, the one about listener rights. We built on Bigelow and [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1443.44s)]
*  said that the First Amendment doesn't distinguish between commercial speech and non-commercial [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1450.16s)]
*  speech. Speech that he argued should be protected under the First Amendment because it allowed the [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1454.24s)]
*  public to be more informed. They, as citizens and consumers, had a right to listen and a right to [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1459.44s)]
*  know. Once again, the argument found an ally in Justice Blackmun who delivered the ruling in May [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1467.04s)]
*  1976. We further hold that so-called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1473.8400000000001s)]
*  the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The individual consumer and society in general may have strong [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1480.8s)]
*  interests in the free flow of commercial information. The ruling was hailed in the press as another [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1486.64s)]
*  big Ralph Nader-backed win for consumers. All right, hooray! People who had been kept in the [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1492.72s)]
*  dark about prescription drug prices suddenly had the information they needed to make decisions that [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1509.8400000000001s)]
*  could save them money. They were thrilled. This was a huge victory for Alan Morrison and Ralph [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1515.5200000000002s)]
*  Nader and consumers rights. Score one for the underdog, the little guy, the champion of the [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1520.8s)]
*  people. Play us some celebration music, baby. This is a huge victory. Wait a minute. Wait, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1526.0s)]
*  hang on. Hang on. Is that a fax machine? I didn't even know I had one of those things. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1534.72s)]
*  Huh. This is from my producer. Oh, shit. No way. Okay. Hey, cut the music. Okay. Let me amend what [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1541.52s)]
*  I just said. This would end up not being a huge win. In fact, it was the opposite. Sure, this may [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1549.52s)]
*  have been a victory for some little guy consumers, but for campaign finance and corruption, the ruling [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1556.8s)]
*  was about to be transformed into a powerful weapon for the biggest of big guy oligarchs. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1563.44s)]
*  The law of unintended consequences was about to kick in with a nudge from the Supreme Court Justice [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1570.0s)]
*  Louis Powell. Remember him? Powell had initially argued that there was, quote, [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1577.12s)]
*  no constitutional right to know, but would change his mind when faced with a golden opportunity [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1584.3999999999999s)]
*  to further his master plan. Okay, let's review. It's 1976. The master planners had used the [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1591.52s)]
*  accidental but fortuitous election of Senator James Buckley to get the Supreme Court to validate [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1602.8s)]
*  a previously radical theory that money wasn't a tool of corruption to buy votes, [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1609.12s)]
*  but was instead a constitutionally protected form of speech. The court holds that the expenditure [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1614.24s)]
*  limitation are violative of First Amendment guarantees, and they are unconstitutional. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1621.04s)]
*  Then Ralph Nader's organization, a group that's supposed to be the polar opposite of the master [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1627.76s)]
*  planners, it goes into court on behalf of consumers and gets the court to say that corporations have [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1633.36s)]
*  at least some of the same First Amendment protections that individuals do. We further hold [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1640.0s)]
*  that so-called commercial speech is not wholly outside the protection of the First and Fourteenth [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1645.12s)]
*  Amendments. So now let's turn to the final case in our lineup, the one that ultimately features [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1650.96s)]
*  the master planner you heard about in the last two episodes, Lewis F. Powell of Powell Memo fame. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1657.52s)]
*  It's still 1976, America's bicentennial. Happy birthday USA. We're in Boston, Massachusetts, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1666.16s)]
*  where another important legal case was building steam in the Bay States courtrooms. First National [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1673.68s)]
*  Bank of Boston versus Bellotti really began as a battle between Massachusetts lawmakers and one of [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1679.44s)]
*  the most influential businessmen in Boston, a man by the name of Richard Hill, who ran the [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1685.68s)]
*  First National Bank of Boston. That's Adam Winkler. He's a professor of law at UCLA, and he wrote [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1691.76s)]
*  extensively about this case in his book, We the Corporations. And while you might not be familiar [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1697.52s)]
*  with this case, you should know that it paved the way for Citizens United. If RFK's assassination [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1703.44s)]
*  and Lynn Jordan's hysterectomy are flapping butterfly wings, this case is Mothra. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1710.72s)]
*  In 1976, Massachusetts passed its own state statute expanding on the amendments to FICA [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1719.92s)]
*  that it passed in Washington, D.C. Essentially, the new Massachusetts law barred corporations [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1726.96s)]
*  from making contributions or expenditures to influence the voting on any ballot initiatives, [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1733.0400000000002s)]
*  unless it was an initiative that clearly affected that particular business. Any ballot measure on [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1739.04s)]
*  individual taxation would be automatically deemed immaterial to their business. Probably not [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1745.68s)]
*  coincidentally, that same year, there was a proposal to put a constitutional amendment on [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1751.84s)]
*  the 1976 Massachusetts state ballot that would raise taxes on the wealthy. And lawmakers in [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1756.8s)]
*  Massachusetts wanted to institute a graduated income tax. Basically say that individuals who [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1762.96s)]
*  made the most money paid a relatively higher percentage of their income in taxes. Individuals [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1768.24s)]
*  like Richard Hill and other high-powered executives, which sounds reasonable, right? Rich people paying [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1773.36s)]
*  their fair share. What a concept. Suffice it to say, Richard Hill and his cronies were not stoked [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1779.36s)]
*  about this idea. But under Massachusetts new law, they were barred from spending any money out of [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1786.24s)]
*  their corporate treasuries on influencing the outcome of this ballot measure. Never mind that [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1792.4s)]
*  they could still spend their own money, just not the company's much larger pile of money. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1797.84s)]
*  They were not too happy about this. And what do good Americans do when they're unhappy? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1804.24s)]
*  They go to court. Richard Hill took it to court and he argued in court that this Massachusetts law [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1809.36s)]
*  that restricted corporations from spending money on these individual tax-related ballot measures [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1817.84s)]
*  was unconstitutional under the first amendment. Hill and First National Bank lost in the Supreme [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1824.48s)]
*  Court of Massachusetts. So they appealed this case to the US Supreme Court, which heard it in 1977. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1830.3200000000002s)]
*  Representing Hill and the other rich guys was Francis Fox, who reminded the court that justices [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1838.48s)]
*  had recently ruled that money is not corruption. Money is speech. Speech is protected unless and [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1844.64s)]
*  until it comes up against a compelling state purpose in carefully drafted legislation, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1852.48s)]
*  which serves that purpose in the least restrictive manner available. In other words, the prohibition [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1859.3600000000001s)]
*  should be made to justify itself. The focus should be on the prohibition. Corporate speaker [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1864.64s)]
*  should not be made to justify his prospective speech. Side note, you may remember that in his [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1870.64s)]
*  memo, Lewis Powell suggested that corporations take a page out of the lefty liberal playbook [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1876.96s)]
*  and file briefs, amicus curiae in the Supreme Court to influence justices' decisions. No surprise then [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1883.1200000000001s)]
*  that corporate America was more than happy to file amicus briefs on behalf of Richard Hill's [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1890.8s)]
*  First National Bank of Boston and that two of those amicus briefs came from groups that might [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1896.8s)]
*  sound familiar. The US Chamber of Commerce, for whom Lewis Powell wrote the Powell Memo, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1902.8s)]
*  and the Pacific Legal Foundation, which had been one of the legal groups inspired by the Powell [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1908.56s)]
*  Memo. But back to our case. Representing Massachusetts is that state's attorney general, [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1914.0s)]
*  Francis Bellotti. He's simply the name on the case, but it's the Massachusetts assistant attorney [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1919.76s)]
*  general, Thomas Kiley, who's defending the state in court. The main thrust of his argument is that [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1925.44s)]
*  businesses are not people and therefore do not have First Amendment rights. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1931.52s)]
*  We start first from the proposition though that corporations do not have First Amendment rights [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1938.16s)]
*  per se, that they are not natural persons, and that they may be restricted to protection of the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1943.84s)]
*  rights that are contained in their charters. The justices heard the oral arguments and then, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1950.4s)]
*  a few days later, they met in what's called a conference. Now, the Supreme Court is a notoriously [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1955.44s)]
*  secretive institution. Not Vatican level, but there's a fair amount that goes on behind the [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1961.8400000000001s)]
*  scenes that the public knows very little about. Here's Adam Winkler again. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1967.04s)]
*  So the justices meet, they vote, and they assign someone to write the opinion. Typically, over the [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1985.44s)]
*  course of some months, they'll pass around some drafts and agree to a final opinion, which usually [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=1998.96s)]
*  reflects their votes in the initial conference. But that's not what happened in First National Bank [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2004.0s)]
*  of Boston versus Bellotti. Normally, we wouldn't know what went on in conference, but in this case, [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2010.24s)]
*  thanks to Adam Winkler, we got a rare glimpse of the messy behind the scenes. For his excellent [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2016.96s)]
*  book, We the Corporations, Adam scoured the papers of the Supreme Court justices, and what he [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2023.1200000000001s)]
*  uncovered in the hundreds of pages of letters, memos, and messages illuminated what happened next. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2028.88s)]
*  As the justices went around the room at the conference, the majority of justices did not [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2034.96s)]
*  think that the court had to say that corporations have the same free speech rights as people. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2040.0s)]
*  Instead, they supported a narrower view. They thought that Massachusetts law needed to give [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2045.2800000000002s)]
*  corporations the opportunity to show that the tax measure on the ballot affected their businesses. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2051.2000000000003s)]
*  It might, for instance, make it harder for corporations like First National Bank to recruit [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2057.36s)]
*  executives if those executives would have to pay higher income taxes. But a limited [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2062.24s)]
*  ruling like that was as far as most of the justices were willing to go. They weren't [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2066.9599999999996s)]
*  willing to go further and say that corporations had the exact same First Amendment rights as [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2072.0s)]
*  citizens. However, one holdout on the court saw his chance. We're going to need some dark, scary music here. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2078.08s)]
*  No, no, that's just creepy. I want listeners to really feel this, something darker. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2087.68s)]
*  No, no, no, not like that. I mean, that's dark, but in a different way. Look, just play the darkest, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2092.64s)]
*  scariest song you can find from 1977. There, there, that's perfect, perfect, perfect. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2098.16s)]
*  Let's welcome back to the stage the OG master planner himself, Justice Lewis Powell. In the [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2105.9199999999996s)]
*  Justice Conference about Baladi, Powell wants to go big, really big. He didn't want a narrow [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2114.08s)]
*  ruling. He wanted a decision that would blow the doors off of free speech limitations for corporations [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2121.92s)]
*  permanently. Powell argued that Massachusetts' law should be struck down because corporations [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2129.36s)]
*  have the same free speech right as individuals, that Massachusetts could not limit corporations [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2136.64s)]
*  to only spending on things that were material to the business, that it was up to the business to [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2142.88s)]
*  decide what to spend its money on. And lawmakers had no role to play in that decision. It was only [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2148.2400000000002s)]
*  Powell who had that very broad perspective at the conference. And the other seven justices who [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2155.84s)]
*  agreed to strike down Massachusetts' law thought instead that the court should rule narrowly. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2161.36s)]
*  One of those seven other justices, William Brennan, was assigned to write the court's final [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2167.2s)]
*  ruling, which would strike down the Massachusetts law, but only in a narrow fashion. But as Brennan [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2173.8399999999997s)]
*  started to write, he ran into a problem. The more he thought about it, the more he became convinced [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2180.56s)]
*  that this kind of ruling wouldn't be effective, that the broader question about whether corporations [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2186.7999999999997s)]
*  have the same political speech rights as individuals would simply show up again in another case. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2192.48s)]
*  And on that broader question, Brennan was clear. He thought corporations did not have the same [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2198.64s)]
*  political speech rights as individuals. And as a result, he said to the other justices, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2204.16s)]
*  I'm not the right one to write this opinion. Justice Brennan issued a written statement to [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2210.8s)]
*  his colleagues, laying out the reasons for his crisis of confidence. It was kind of an oh shit [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2215.28s)]
*  moment. In the margins of his copy of Brennan's letter, Justice Lewis Powell wrote, wow, with an [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2220.48s)]
*  exclamation point, expressing his surprise at this turn of events. Of course, it was also an amazing [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2226.48s)]
*  opportunity. Powell wrote another memo. Man, this guy loves memos. In this new memo to the other [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2233.12s)]
*  justices, he subtly pitched himself as the replacement to write the court's majority opinion [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2240.48s)]
*  that would become the law of the land. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2246.4s)]
*  Powell was eager to expand the political speech rights of corporations. Massachusetts is trying [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2248.64s)]
*  to prevent corporations from doing what he thinks is the most important thing they can do, which is [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2255.12s)]
*  to get politically active and to fight for their rights and to defeat the rising tide of business [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2260.08s)]
*  regulation and what Powell saw as nothing short of socialism. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2267.2000000000003s)]
*  Chief Justice Warren Burger let Powell write the opinion. But remember, Powell, who argued that the [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2271.84s)]
*  entire law should be struck down on the grounds that corporations have free speech rights, [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2278.0s)]
*  he was still in the minority on the court. Justice Byron White had always felt the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2282.96s)]
*  Massachusetts law should be upheld. He was joined by Justice Brennan, who no longer supported the [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2287.84s)]
*  idea of even a narrow ruling. Justice Thurgood Marshall thought corporations could be restricted [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2292.88s)]
*  in political spending, and Justice Rehnquist argued that corporations had no political speech [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2298.56s)]
*  rights at all. That meant four justices against Powell. And Chief Justice Burger had also started [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2303.84s)]
*  to waver, wondering if striking down the Massachusetts law would undermine federal [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2311.2799999999997s)]
*  anti-corruption laws. This was turning into a real nail-biter of a court case. Powell was in [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2316.96s)]
*  danger of losing the majority. But then a light bulb went off in Powell's brain. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2323.6s)]
*  He remembered that Virginia pharmacy case, the one we just discussed earlier in this episode, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2332.64s)]
*  in his genteel southern manner. Powell referenced the case and reminded his fellow justices that [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2338.7999999999997s)]
*  they literally just voted for that ruling, which said the public has an inherent right to hear [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2345.04s)]
*  corporate speech. So by that logic, didn't the voters of Massachusetts also have a right to [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2351.44s)]
*  hear what the First National Bank of Boston and other businesses had to say about ballot measures? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2357.36s)]
*  So Powell uses Blackman's argument from Virginia pharmacy to secure his majority and in the end, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2363.04s)]
*  radically rewrite American constitutional law. Powell convinced just enough justices, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2370.64s)]
*  including Justice Burger, to join him in a five to four ruling that said that the Massachusetts [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2377.12s)]
*  restriction on political contributions by corporations violated the First Amendment [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2383.6s)]
*  and was thus unconstitutional. Giving corporations a broad and expansive right to spend their money [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2388.88s)]
*  on politics and elections. That was a decision that would really radically transform American [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2396.16s)]
*  democracy. The author of the Powell memo had been alone in the initial conference and now this [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2404.0s)]
*  master planner had forever enshrined his own beliefs into a law that favored corporations, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2409.84s)]
*  not people. Here's Justice Powell reading the decision. The First Amendment's primary concern [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2416.32s)]
*  and therefore the court's concern always has been the preservation of free and uninhibited [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2423.2s)]
*  dissemination of information and ideas. Especially if that information and those ideas conform to the [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2430.64s)]
*  Powell memo. Am I right? If the restrictive view of corporate speech taken by the Massachusetts court [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2438.48s)]
*  were accepted, government would have the power to deprive society of the views of corporations [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2446.0s)]
*  on all issues other than those that could be proved to affect adversely their property [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2452.72s)]
*  or business interest. How sad for us if we were to be deprived of the views of corporations. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2460.08s)]
*  You can't hear it but I'm rolling my eyes here. Powell elaborated further on this point in the [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2467.12s)]
*  final written opinion stating quote, it is the type of speech indispensable to decision making [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2472.56s)]
*  in a democracy and this is not less true because the speech comes from a corporation rather than [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2478.7200000000003s)]
*  an individual. Thanks to Powell's ruling, corporations now had even more First Amendment rights [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2485.52s)]
*  and the consequences have been enormous. The principles established by the Bellotti case [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2492.56s)]
*  that corporations effectively have the same First Amendment speech rights as individuals, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2498.8s)]
*  that it was inappropriate for businesses to be limited in political spending campaigns, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2503.84s)]
*  would be very, very influential and completely transform American jurisprudence over time. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2510.3999999999996s)]
*  Put another way, the case created the principle infamously summarized by Massachusetts future [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2518.0s)]
*  governor Mitt Romney. They brought us a whole binder full of women. Yeah, he said that too. I [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2523.8399999999997s)]
*  mean this. Corporations are people, my friend. Boom, shockalaka. You wanted me to show you the [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2528.56s)]
*  money? Well, there it is. There's your payoff. Lewis Powell had successfully blown open the [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2533.44s)]
*  floodgates for the kind of corporate spending that his memo said was necessary for a big business [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2539.6s)]
*  takeover of the country. We started the 1970s with a push to get money out of politics. We end it with [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2545.92s)]
*  a flood of cash and Buckley especially proved to be the biggest crack in the dam. That decision [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2553.76s)]
*  allowed candidates to spend as much as they wanted. No spending limits provided you could [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2560.16s)]
*  get your hands on the cash. Of course, there were plenty of wealthy people in corporations who had [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2565.6s)]
*  the kind of cash that could buy elections, but the Buckley decision had ensured that candidates were [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2572.72s)]
*  only allowed to take a limited amount. So money found a different way to flow. It would go to the [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2578.48s)]
*  master planners supposedly independent organizations that could spend unlimited amounts [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2584.8s)]
*  of cash on the candidates behalf provided that these organizations weren't explicitly coordinating [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2590.48s)]
*  with the candidates they were supporting, which of course they would never do. Yeah, it was [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2597.6800000000003s)]
*  bullshit, but legally speaking, these organizations could insist they didn't explicitly coordinate. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2602.6400000000003s)]
*  Not surprisingly, these independent expenditures became the way to get money into the system and [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2609.2s)]
*  buy elections. Independent organizations which support Reagan can spend and spend thanks to a [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2616.16s)]
*  loophole in the campaign law. There is no limit on what these independent organizations can spend. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2622.56s)]
*  These so-called independent organizations, otherwise known as political action committees or PACs [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2627.7599999999998s)]
*  became the vehicle for getting money into campaigns and they were growing in number. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2634.0s)]
*  In 1974, there were about 600 PACs and only 89 were affiliated with corporations. By 1980, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2639.12s)]
*  after the Supreme Court's Buckley and Bellotti rulings changed the game, the number of PACs [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2647.52s)]
*  nearly quadrupled to 2300 and nearly half of them had corporate ties. This is simplifying things a [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2653.12s)]
*  bit, but the tide of corporate spending on political activities rose exponentially in that [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2660.48s)]
*  six-year period and no one with any power seemed to be interested in doing anything to stop it. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  Except for one guy. A guy who looked like the opposite of the hippie liberal reformers and [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2672.88s)]
*  their legions of lefty activists. This was a combat veteran and a war hero, a conservative [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2678.4s)]
*  Republican from a super conservative state. Burned in a campaign finance scandal, he would [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2684.72s)]
*  spend the rest of his life crusading against the master planner's scheme to legalize corruption. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2690.72s)]
*  He was pissed and he was going to take his fight to both parties' voters. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2696.7999999999997s)]
*  Those of us privileged to hold a public office have ourselves to blame for the sickness in [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2701.68s)]
*  American public life today and we are the defenders of a campaign finance system that is nothing less [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2706.3199999999997s)]
*  than an elaborate influence peddling scheme in which both parties conspire to stay in office [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2714.72s)]
*  by selling the country to the highest bidder. And this guy wasn't just complaining about the [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2721.4399999999996s)]
*  problem, he had a plan of his own. That's next time on Masterplan. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7xsxusS34&t=2727.7599999999998s)]
