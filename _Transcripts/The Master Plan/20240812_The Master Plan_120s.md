Hosted by David Sirota, former speechwriter for Bernie Sanders and Oscar-nominated co-writer of _Don’t Look Up_ , _Master Plan_ exposes the deliberate scheme to legalize corruption in the U.S., allowing the wealthy to buy policies that benefit themselves and screw everyone else. 

_The Lever_ has unearthed never-before-reported documents proving this 50-year plot was a coordinated effort by wealthy individuals and political ideologues. Over the course of 10 episodes, the podcast series follows the historic thread from Watergate in the ’70s through the Citizens United decision and the current Supreme Court scandals.
