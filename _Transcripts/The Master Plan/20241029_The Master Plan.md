# Episode 11 Hell Or High Water
**The Master Plan:** [October 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTMByA9Bt5Q)
*  When we fight, we win.
*  This was August 2024.
*  American politics was on fire.
*  Donald Trump had survived an assassination attempt.
*  Joe Biden had dropped out of the presidential race and Kamala Harris had been installed
*  at the top of the Democratic ticket.
*  Amid all this chaos, I decided to take a trip to see the insane circus firsthand.
*  I am in the hall of the Democratic National Convention.
*  I just saw Mark Hamill, Luke Skywalker walk by.
*  Though this was a last minute trip and I hadn't done any planning, I managed to get into a
*  few of the places you don't see on TV, the private parties.
*  So I'm here at the Salt Shed in Chicago, which is a concert venue.
*  They're going to have a Wycliffe concert and it's a climate event.
*  Clean power, happy hour.
*  It's a bunch of climate groups.
*  The Democrats' gathering was in Chicago, a place I know pretty well.
*  I went to college right outside of Chicago.
*  I worked my first newspaper job in Chicago.
*  I went to my first Democratic convention in Chicago in 1996.
*  I worked on my first political campaign against a billionaire in Chicago.
*  And through that, I got a taste of Chicago's notorious political culture.
*  Chicago is the most corrupt city in the United States based on data from the Justice Department.
*  Now, when you hear the term Chicago-style corruption, you might imagine smoke-filled
*  back rooms and secret exchanges of envelopes of cash.
*  One of the first things I noticed at the Democratic convention in 2024 is that corruption
*  today is much cleaner and out in the open.
*  It's less dirty envelopes stuffed with cash and more like the corruption you hear about
*  on Wall Street or at a Swiss bank.
*  Glossy, systematic, mechanized, sanitized and corporatized.
*  This is the new immersive corruption of the masterplan era, where it's right there on
*  display for anyone bothering to look.
*  There's all the corporate stuff that's sort of integrated into everything.
*  There was the Democratic cloakroom sponsored by Microsoft.
*  I saw this kind of thing over and over at the DNC.
*  Corporations sponsoring every event, letting everyone know they're the real stakeholders,
*  the owners of American politics.
*  There's a big billboard that says with special thanks FedEx, Reynolds, the tobacco company,
*  SAP, Blue Cross Blue Shield, Stand With Crypto, that's the name of a group, and the American
*  Clean Power Association, the American Gas Association, the Edison Electric Institute,
*  and the Nuclear Energy Institute.
*  And this is a post-Gabel party celebrating power to the voters.
*  Of course, this wasn't about power to the voters, as the sign at the event insisted.
*  The convention was a gathering of the most powerful public officials in America.
*  And so these sponsors are making clear that politics is about the power of the corporations
*  and billionaires now permitted to buy everything after the master planners so successfully
*  deregulated the campaign finance system and legalized corruption.
*  What started to freak me out at the DNC was not just how ubiquitous all the corruption
*  is, but how normal it seems.
*  No one's shaken by this, no one's bothered by this at all.
*  Maybe even I'm not bothered by it.
*  I'm sitting here drinking an IPA.
*  That's how corruption gets normalized.
*  Nobody even notices the contradictions.
*  If I even said anything about the contradictions to anyone here, they'd look at me like I was
*  an insane person.
*  These thoughts made me feel pretty lonely and pretty demoralized.
*  Like maybe I really was the insane person.
*  And maybe looking at this bacchanal of money politics, it would be better to just succumb
*  to the master planners.
*  I know this stake doesn't exist.
*  Maybe it would be better to just live in the matrix?
*  Ignorance is bliss.
*  But the thing is, not everyone at the convention has just decided ignorance is bliss.
*  While sulking around the convention hall one night, I heard a voice I didn't expect to
*  hear.
*  That same voice from those prescription drug bus trips I'd been on all those years ago.
*  We need an economy that works for all of us, not just the billionaire class.
*  It was a voice that had been made out to be a pariah within much of the Democratic Party,
*  but was now getting some applause.
*  Get big money out of our political process.
*  Bernie Sanders' diatribe seemed aimed directly at the lobbyists, donors, and master planners
*  in the luxury boxes looking down on the convention floor.
*  Billionaires in both parties should not be able to buy elections, including primary elections.
*  And then came a proposed solution.
*  For the sake of our democracy, we must overturn the disastrous Citizens United Supreme Court
*  decision and move toward public funding of elections.
*  This wasn't just a reminder of what might have been had Bernie won the election in 2016
*  or 2020.
*  This was a primal scream.
*  So yeah, I cheered along with the crowd as it politely applauded.
*  For a minute, I felt this foreign, weird feeling I hadn't felt in a long time.
*  What's it called?
*  Joy.
*  No, not exactly.
*  Hope in the face of difficulty.
*  Hope in the face of uncertainty.
*  Oh right, right.
*  Hope.
*  Thanks Obama.
*  Yeah, I felt hope, which felt good.
*  Just like when Obama said it, the hope lasted for all of five minutes because literally
*  the next speaker after Bernie was this guy.
*  Fellow Democrats, welcome to Chicago.
*  It was J.B. Pritzker who spent $350 million of his Hyatt hotel inheritance to buy the
*  Illinois governorship over the course of two campaigns.
*  And just minutes after Bernie's rant against billionaires, Governor Pritzker delivered
*  the line of the night.
*  Donald Trump thinks that we should trust him on the economy because he claims to be very
*  rich, but take it from an actual billionaire.
*  I could feel my hope evaporating with the wild cheering.
*  Trump is rich in only one thing, stupidity.
*  Pritzker literally touted his billionaire status and he got effusive applause for it.
*  Yeah, that really happened.
*  And Pritzker was followed by a speech from a former credit card industry CEO reassuring
*  the donor class that Kamala Harris understands that government must work in partnership with
*  the business community.
*  Much of the convention went this way.
*  Some populist speeches mixed in with corporate speakers offering up vague platitudes, like
*  this speech from Kamala Harris's brother-in-law, an executive from Uber, who promised that
*  when it comes to Kamala...
*  As president, I know she'll fight for you.
*  Now let's be clear.
*  What was going on on the Republican side wasn't any better than the depravity at the DNC.
*  The Republicans just offered a different, even less subtle, more in-your-face celebration
*  of wealth and power.
*  Just before the DNC, word dropped that the richest man in the world would be launching
*  a new super PAC to bankroll the election bid of Donald Trump, who if he wins, would be
*  in a position to reward this same donor's companies with even more government contracts
*  than they already had.
*  And you know, Elon, I love Elon Musk.
*  And I read, I didn't even know this, he didn't even tell me about it, but he gives me $45
*  million a month.
*  So the endless summer of 2024 made crystal clear that we're living in the master planners
*  world.
*  And when I left Chicago, I left with questions.
*  Which future will we choose at this fork in the road?
*  A future in which we all decide we've had enough and that we're going to reduce the
*  power of billionaires, corporations, and master planners?
*  Or a future in which we just cheer for the billionaires as the master plan continues?
*  When we started this series, we promised you 10 episodes.
*  You're on 10 on your guitar.
*  Where can you go from there?
*  But because these are such big questions, we decided to channel our inner spinal tap.
*  We need that extra push over the cliff.
*  You know what we do?
*  Put it up to 11.
*  Exactly.
*  In the 11th and final episode of this season, we crank up the volume and ask the biggest
*  question of all.
*  As corruption now threatens the survival of democracy, what exactly will it take to
*  forge a different path?
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Master Plan.
*  In the spring of 2005, right before the master planners turned the Supreme Court of Sandra
*  Day O'Connor and William Rehnquist into the Supreme Court of John Roberts and Sam Alito,
*  the writer David Foster Wallace delivered a college commencement speech.
*  There are these two young fish swimming along, and they happen to meet an older fish swimming
*  the other way who nods at them and says, morning boys, how's the water?
*  And the two young fish swim on for a bit.
*  And then eventually one of them looks over at the other and goes, what the hell is water?
*  The acclaimed author captured a feeling I had right at that particular time in my own
*  life.
*  That time I told you about all the way back in episode one, that period of disillusionment
*  that I experienced as a young person after spending five years swimming in the swampy
*  corruption of Washington.
*  The parable really spoke to me because as Wallace said, it has everything to do with
*  simple awareness, awareness of what is so real and essential, so hidden in plain sight
*  all around us all the time that we have to keep reminding ourselves over and over, this
*  is water.
*  This is water.
*  I've been thinking a lot about this speech as our team has reported this series over
*  the last two years.
*  It's on my mind because corruption is our society's water.
*  It's so immersive that it can lead us to forget that it is all around us.
*  In this episode, we're going to get into some of the ways we can reverse the master plan.
*  But before we do, it's worth looking at how America is swimming through all this water
*  in the here and now, the water of corruption that the master planners took 50 years to
*  flood into the system.
*  Let's start with elections.
*  This episode is being released one week before the 2024 presidential election and the defining
*  feature of the contest isn't just how much money is being spent, but also how at this
*  point, nobody's even trying to hide the transactional nature of all that cash.
*  Remember how Supreme Court justices defined corruption as only explicit quid pro quo,
*  Latin for this, for that?
*  Well here's the quid.
*  Donald Trump summoned a who's who of top lobbyists and executives from the oil and gas industry
*  to the upscale La Quinta slash bribery palace he calls Mar-a-Lago and proceeded to solicit
*  a billion dollars from the fossil fuel companies to get him elected.
*  And now here's the quo.
*  In exchange, the Washington Post reports, quote, he vowed to immediately reverse dozens
*  of President Biden's environmental rules and policies and stop new ones from being enacted.
*  And this kind of thing isn't just happening on the Republican side.
*  Rich Democratic donors and business leaders are contributing money to Vice President Kamala
*  Harris's presidential campaign, but some are asking, is there a catch?
*  Some of these donors are now openly suggesting Harris should replace the head of the Federal
*  Trade Commission, progressive darling Lena Kahn.
*  And these aren't exactly mom and pop grassroots donors.
*  Media mogul and Democratic donor Barry Diller said he would lobby Kamala Harris to remove
*  Lena Kahn.
*  And there is a similar sentiment being expressed by mega donor Reid Hoffman, who donated $10
*  billion to the Biden Harris campaign.
*  This doesn't even seem like an election anymore.
*  It seems like an auction.
*  Give me 30 mil, I want that bag.
*  Or once gone, twice sold to the billionaire in Balenciaga's shoes.
*  But legalized corruption isn't confined just to the presidential election.
*  It's also all the spending to buy seemingly every election up and down the 2024 ballot.
*  AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is spending millions of dollars
*  in primary races.
*  Nearly half of all the corporate money flowing into the election this year is coming from
*  the crypto industry.
*  The 2024 election will be the most expensive ever with an overall price tag of $15.9 billion.
*  And this is just the spending that we know about.
*  There's a whole ocean of dark money that's difficult to trace and quantify.
*  The question is, what is all this money buying?
*  It's buying legislation, court rulings and regulations for sure.
*  But it's also buying silence.
*  Think about the world around us.
*  More than half of working age Americans are struggling to pay for health care, even if
*  they have insurance.
*  Roughly half of all Americans ages 55 to 66 have nothing save for retirement.
*  More than 137 million Americans are living in places with unhealthy levels of air pollution.
*  Not good news.
*  U.S. life expectancy decreased by the biggest margin since World War II.
*  Corruption, deep masterplan level corruption, is the fact that, in the face of all this
*  preventable pain and suffering, the reaction from the elected government is most often
*  this.
*  That's right, nothing at all, just total silence.
*  The question is every public official knowing that if they try to end all the stealing
*  and the looting and the misery created by corporations and billionaires, they'll likely
*  be spent into the ground in their next election.
*  And so for the most part, they keep quiet.
*  Beyond elections, there's the whole other swampy nightmare of corruption in the courts.
*  Okay, just jump right into my nightmare.
*  The water is warm.
*  After all the revelations about billionaires treating justices to lavish trips and gifts,
*  master planners are now trying to block any crackdown on the most flagrant corruption.
*  Democrats in the Senate advanced a bill to create an enforceable code of conduct for
*  Supreme Court justices, the only members of the federal government who don't have one.
*  Republican senators refuse to allow the bill to even come to a vote.
*  The court's conservatives also just created an entire new get out of jail free card for
*  government corruption, making it far harder to prosecute a president for bribery.
*  We're coming on the air with major breaking news from the U.S. Supreme Court.
*  Moments ago, the justices ruling on Donald Trump's claim of absolute immunity from criminal
*  prosecution.
*  The court deciding this morning presidents do have immunity for official acts.
*  Remember when justices Roberts, Alito and Kavanaugh said this in their Supreme Court
*  confirmation hearing?
*  No one is above the law and that includes the president.
*  Under the Constitution, the president is not above the law.
*  I don't think the president is above the law.
*  Yeah, that was...
*  Bullshit!
*  Gesundheit.
*  We'll see how that new immunity ruling from the Supreme Court plays out in the coming
*  years.
*  One thing we do know for sure is that the Supreme Court's other rulings are now threatening
*  to undermine new corruption prosecutions.
*  In Ohio, the old Citizens United ruling is now being used as a criminal defense strategy.
*  Former Ohio House Speaker Larry Householder is fighting against his 20-year sentence.
*  Householders' attorneys argue that his conviction relied on undisclosed campaign contributions
*  by federal law and protected by the First Amendment, thus violating freedom of speech
*  laws.
*  A jury found that Householder took a $61 million bribe in exchange for a billion dollar
*  bailout for First Energy.
*  The utility company already admitted to bribing him.
*  Next up, remember last episode when we told you about the recent Supreme Court case actually
*  legalizing bribery?
*  Well, that may now be used as a criminal defense strategy in corruption-famous Illinois.
*  A 6-3 majority ruled that a gratuity was not bribery and therefore not illegal.
*  Mike Madigan, the ComEd 4, Ed Burke, even Rod Blagojevich.
*  Today's Supreme Court ruling could have an impact on all Illinois public officials convicted
*  or accused of bribery.
*  In New York City, that same Supreme Court bribery case is now being invoked after Mayor
*  Eric Adams was indicted on corruption charges.
*  Defense attorney Alex Spyro insisted today that Eric Adams should never have been charged.
*  Courtesies to politicians are not federal crimes.
*  Congressmen get upgrades.
*  They get better tables at restaurants.
*  That's just what happens.
*  Spyro filed a motion with the court to dismiss the bribery allegations against Adams, all
*  told worth more than $100,000.
*  Clearly, this is the master planner's world now, but they aren't done trying to shape
*  that world, as evidenced by another recent bombshell revelation.
*  And what does Leonard Leo plan to do with all of that dark money?
*  In an October 2024 interview with a conservative website, Leo laid it out in Powell memo-esque
*  terms, saying he wants to recruit people to, quote, control the choke points of society.
*  The folks who have the greatest capability of entering into and helping to control the
*  choke points of society, it's really important to find those people, to identify them, to
*  recruit them.
*  Then Leo said he aims to, quote, infiltrate the entire culture.
*  And that means being at the tip of the spear, filing those lawsuits, building those talent
*  pipelines, placing personnel in positions of influence, and then, of course, also trying
*  to influence social and cultural institutions, infiltrating the press, infiltrating entertainment,
*  conservative movement, building beachheads in areas like news, entertainment, business
*  and finance, corporate C-suites, educational institutions.
*  The word unprecedented is overused in our society.
*  But taken together, all of what's going on in the present moment is actually, for real,
*  unprecedented.
*  We are now in uncharted waters, and we are minnows swimming among sharks.
*  That's why when I heard Governor Pritzker's line and all the boisterous cheering it generated
*  at the Democratic convention, take it from an actual billionaire.
*  Well, I felt like simply leaving the convention hall and walking myself into Lake Michigan,
*  never to be heard from again.
*  And if you've listened all the way to this point, I'm guessing you feel the same way.
*  But that's not what we should do.
*  After the break, we're going to meet those who are reacting to this mess with a more
*  positive, proactive and constructive attitude, a reaction that invokes a clarion call from
*  the era when the master plan was just getting started.
*  I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take this anymore!
*  There is no America.
*  There is no democracy.
*  There is only IBM and ITT and AT&T and DuPont, Dow, Union Carbide and Exxon.
*  Those are the nations of the world today.
*  It's the mid-1970s.
*  The Powell Memo is being implemented.
*  The post-Watergate campaign finance reforms are being gutted.
*  Plans to roll back the New Deal are being formulated.
*  And out comes Network, a movie that seems to completely understand how the master planners
*  see the world and what they want to create.
*  The world is a college of corporations inexorably determined by the immutable bylaws of business.
*  The world is a business, Mr. Beale.
*  In Network, this lecture from corporate management is aimed at the central protagonist, a disgruntled
*  newscaster named Howard Beale, who started telling harsh truths on the air.
*  We know things are bad, worse than bad.
*  They're crazy.
*  It's like everything everywhere is going crazy so we don't go out anymore.
*  Network seems as resonant now in this era of legalized corruption as it was when it
*  first came out in theaters nearly 50 years ago.
*  And so does Howard Beale's demand.
*  You've got to get mad.
*  You've got to say, I'm a human being, god damn it.
*  My life has value.
*  So I want you to get up now and go to the window, open it, and stick your head out and
*  yell, I'm as mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore.
*  In the movie, people start screaming out their windows.
*  I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it anymore.
*  I'm mad as hell.
*  I'm not going to take it anymore.
*  But here in real life, angrily screaming out your window or despondently jumping into a
*  lake is probably not going to do much to stop the master planners who don't like democracy
*  and who see the world as one giant business that they own.
*  What might achieve better results is the stuff being done by people who are confronting the
*  problem head on.
*  So let's take a look at a few ways that those folks are trying to fight back.
*  First up, let's start with the whole issue of transparency.
*  The idea that we should at least be able to know who is spending all this money to buy
*  elections.
*  Throughout this series, we've mentioned Senator Sheldon Whitehouse's completely reasonable
*  Disclose Act.
*  When corporations and other wealthy interests spend money, more than $10,000, to influence
*  our elections, their identities must be disclosed.
*  Whitehouse and campaign finance reform groups have made real progress with this bill.
*  It's now supported by every Senate Democrat.
*  Getting any bill this far up the political food chain is real progress.
*  But of course, there's Mitch McConnell and his fellow obstructionists.
*  Senate Republicans have blocked legislation to expose the names of wealthy donors who
*  give unlimited funds to so-called dark money organizations.
*  Thanks to that kind of obstruction, dark money is now not just a Washington problem, it's
*  everywhere.
*  So-called dark money has arrived in local elections.
*  Dark money is pouring into the Denver School Board race.
*  Just who is pumping money into secret nonprofit funds linked to Lansing lawmakers?
*  But there is good news.
*  There's progress being made far away from Washington, D.C.
*  Take Arizona, a swing state that was the home of campaign finance reformer John McCain,
*  and that passed landmark anti-corruption legislation in the late 1990s.
*  But in recent years, utility companies used dark money to buy elections for friendly Arizona
*  regulators.
*  $8 million in dark money secured an Arizona gubernatorial win for Republican former ice
*  cream CEO Doug Ducey.
*  And then in 2016, Arizona Republicans gutted the state's campaign spending disclosure law.
*  And so right around then, this guy had his Howard Beal moment and then went to work.
*  Arizona voters have a right to know who's contributing to political advertising.
*  That's Terry Goddard, a former mayor of Phoenix and Arizona attorney general.
*  And because of dark money, so much of what we're seeing on the TV and get it coming through
*  our mailbox is mysterious.
*  It's paid for by some coward who's hiding and doesn't want us to know who it is that's
*  paying for these ads.
*  Goddard spearheaded a ballot measure to try to impose a dark money disclosure law on the
*  politicians trying to keep all the corruption hidden.
*  If passed, the ballot initiative would require organizations that run political ads to disclose
*  their big donors.
*  The ballot measure campaign was not an overnight success.
*  In 2018, they were derailed by a legal challenge.
*  In 2020, COVID halted their efforts.
*  Then in 2022, another lawsuit tried to stop them.
*  In that case, Governor Doug Ducey and other Republican state leaders filed a brief supporting
*  the argument that Arizona voters should not be allowed to vote on the dark money issue
*  this November.
*  But Terry Goddard and campaign finance reformers survived the legal challenge.
*  And when the votes were finally counted, Arizona voters are making it very clear this election
*  that they didn't want dark money in political campaigns.
*  Here's a look at the results.
*  The AP confirming that Prop 211 will pass with roughly three out of four voters approving
*  it across party lines.
*  It'll force donors of at least $5,000 and up that pay for all of those negative ads
*  to publicly disclose their identities.
*  It won with a whopping 72% of the vote.
*  72%.
*  But of course, that wasn't the final word because guess who is waiting to file a lawsuit?
*  Can you guess?
*  Hi, I'm Saul Goodman.
*  Did you know that you have rights?
*  The Constitution says you do.
*  Better call Saul.
*  Nope, not Saul Goodman.
*  No, no, no.
*  Waiting to file the lawsuit were, of course, the master planners at the Koch Empire's Americans
*  for Prosperity, the same group that had previously filed that anti-disclosure case at the Supreme
*  Court.
*  In this new case, Americans for Prosperity tried to block Arizona's ballot measure from
*  being implemented.
*  In the suit, AFP resurrected the old NAACP case from the 1950s that you heard about in
*  the last episode, the one that helped billionaire donors and corporations pretend to be the
*  same as persecuted civil rights activists in the Jim Crow South.
*  But so far, at the time that we're recording this episode, AFP is failing to find success.
*  They've been rejected by a lower court.
*  Of course, the federal case is now being appealed because, as Terry Goddard told a local television
*  station, so much is at stake for the master planners.
*  The Koch Organization and the folks behind Americans for Prosperity are the biggest dogs
*  on the porch, and they want to protect their franchise, which is a dark money franchise.
*  So bottom line is, I think they feel that this is something that they can ultimately
*  weasel up to the Supreme Court.
*  Whether or not that happens, the entire situation spotlights how states and cities can and are
*  fighting back, even as Washington seems gridlocked.
*  Of course, disclosure isn't some cure-all.
*  There are other necessary deterrents needed as well, among them criminal prosecutions.
*  And here again is some encouraging news.
*  Even though the Roberts Supreme Court has made corruption prosecutions more difficult,
*  there are some prosecutors trying to forge an anti-corruption path.
*  In the last few years, we've seen a Trump-appointed Republican federal prosecutor bring that huge
*  corruption case that we mentioned earlier, the bribery case involving Ohio's former Republican
*  House Speaker.
*  We've also seen a Democratic-appointed federal prosecutor bring corruption cases against
*  New York's Democratic Mayor Eric Adams and against a top Democratic power broker in Washington.
*  Federal authorities announced bribery charges against New Jersey Senator Bob Menendez and
*  his wife.
*  FBI agents raided the Menendez home in June of 2022, uncovering over $480,000 in cash,
*  stuffed in envelopes and closets.
*  Again, the Supreme Court is making these prosecutions more difficult.
*  But the cases are going forward, which is a good thing.
*  And in just the last year, public corruption cases have actually ticked up.
*  Not a cure-all, but it's something.
*  The problem, though, is that these cases can all be appealed up to the same Roberts Supreme
*  Court that's been whittling down the federal bribery laws.
*  Two potential solutions for that are expanding the court and creating term limits for justices,
*  which would at least provide the chance for a less corrupt court in our lifetime.
*  And these ideas are finally part of the political conversation.
*  Congressional Democrats are wading into a political firestorm over the Supreme Court.
*  A group of lawmakers plans to introduce legislation today that would expand the court from nine
*  justices to 13.
*  President Biden has a compelling new pitch that includes major changes to the Supreme
*  Court.
*  Sources tell NBC News his proposed reforms, which would need congressional approval, include
*  establishing term limits for justices.
*  Recent polls show majorities of Americans support both court expansion and term limits.
*  But once again, there's obstruction from...
*  Yep, Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans.
*  The Supreme Court is under attack.
*  The big kahuna, of course, would be doing what Bernie said at the Democratic National
*  Convention, overturning Citizens United.
*  That will almost certainly never happen at the current Supreme Court.
*  But there is another way to do it.
*  I rise today in support of the pending constitutional amendment, which would restore to Congress
*  and the states the authority to rein in the enormous sums of money that are flooding into
*  the political process.
*  The People's Rights Amendment would overturn Citizens United.
*  We need a constitutional amendment that will overturn Citizens United.
*  OK, so yeah, I know what you're thinking.
*  And you're right.
*  A constitutional amendment is a really long process.
*  But it's not starting at square one here.
*  You need 38 states to ratify such an amendment.
*  And 22 states and 842 local governments have already called for such an amendment through
*  ballot measures or legislative resolutions.
*  That includes Republican-leaning states such as Montana and West Virginia.
*  But short of a constitutional amendment, where does that leave things?
*  I've thought about this for 25 years.
*  And I keep coming back to the same answer that Bernie Sanders mentioned at the DNC.
*  Move toward public funding of elections.
*  Public financing of elections.
*  Yeah, OK.
*  It's a mouthful.
*  And yeah, it sounds like the kind of super theoretical and complicated idea that would
*  put you to sleep during a lecture at Ferris Bueller's High School.
*  In 1930, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the anyone, anyone.
*  But don't fall asleep.
*  Public financing really isn't boring or complicated.
*  What it basically means is that the government provides funds to candidates so that those
*  candidates can run well-resourced campaigns without having to rely on private money that
*  comes with the expectation of legislative favors.
*  The public money is given to any candidates of any party or ideology who qualify.
*  And this isn't some crazy, new-fangled idea.
*  It's been around since Teddy Roosevelt first proposed it in 1907.
*  In fact, there was a viable public financing system for presidential elections for a few
*  decades after Watergate.
*  And there are some versions of public financing systems in a bunch of cities and in 13 states,
*  including in swing states like Arizona, Maine, and Florida.
*  And three times in the last 50 years, Congress got close to doing it at the federal level
*  for all congressional and Senate candidates.
*  The Senate passed it in 1973, but it was blocked in the Democratic-controlled House.
*  Then in 1992, Congress actually did pass it.
*  But then came the Sith Lord.
*  Yep, you guessed it.
*  Clearly, it was crafted in a manner to benefit the Democratic Party at the expense of the
*  Republican Party, and that's why it's been so divisive and partisan, and why the president
*  will veto it.
*  And there will be plenty of votes there to sustain the veto.
*  And that's exactly what President George H.W. Bush did.
*  He vetoed it.
*  And then only a few years ago, the House passed a public financing bill.
*  But once again, it was blocked in the Senate by...
*  Yeah, him again.
*  Were you expecting someone else?
*  To be sure, public financing can sound like just another wasteful taxpayer handout to
*  greedy politicians.
*  The attack ad that you don't like, well, there's a good chance you help pay for it.
*  Florida taxpayers have already shelled out more than $5 million this year to publicly
*  finance political campaigns.
*  Taxpayer money is being spent to help candidates in Denver run for office.
*  I don't want to pay for campaigns I don't agree with.
*  If you think about it for only a second, that does sound outrageous.
*  But if you think about it a bit more, the current system is the real problem.
*  My old boss, Montana Governor Brian Schweitzer, put it pretty simply when he was asked about
*  it.
*  So public financing of all federal campaigns?
*  It'd be a good start.
*  We have the best government money can buy.
*  That's the right way to think about it.
*  If the public doesn't finance campaigns, someone else will.
*  And if we let campaign money from billionaires and corporations control every election, then
*  we're effectively letting the master planners buy the best government for them, not us.
*  That's what we have now.
*  A government in which a recent study by Princeton researchers found that, quote, the preferences
*  of the average American appear to have only a minuscule, near zero, statistically nonsignificant
*  impact upon public policy.
*  It's a privately financed government satirized in that scene in the comedy film The Distinguished
*  Gentleman, where a lobbyist takes a new congressman to lunch.
*  I'd like to do more money for you, but first I've got to get your positions on a few issues.
*  Where are you on sugar price supports?
*  Sugar price supports?
*  Where should I be, Terry?
*  Shit, it makes no difference to me.
*  If you're for him, I got money for you from my sugar producers in Louisiana and Hawaii.
*  If you're against him, I got money for you from the candy manufacturers.
*  You pick, let's say, four.
*  Yeah, four.
*  Four.
*  That's the system we have now.
*  It's great for the master planners.
*  They love it, which is why they so oppose a public financing system that would give people
*  a way to run for office that doesn't force them to rely on legalized bribes.
*  So if disclosure laws, prosecutions, public financing of elections, and all these other
*  reforms are so obvious and so straightforward, then why don't we have them already?
*  Is it just the master planners obstruction, or is it something more?
*  That's after the break.
*  There is no more important issue because the money comes into play everywhere and reform
*  is not for the short-winded.
*  It's a long, long battle.
*  This is Fred Wertheimer, who you heard in episode two.
*  I mean, you know, this is about power and money equals power.
*  So what you can do is curb it.
*  You can limit it.
*  But then you have to be ready to fight again.
*  Wertheimer is one of the people from common cause who back in the early 1970s helped shame
*  Richard Nixon into signing the first campaign finance reform legislation in half a century.
*  I've thought a lot about our interview with him as I've considered all those reforms I
*  just reviewed.
*  It's a continuum.
*  You fight for as long as you're in the game and then someone comes along and picks up
*  and they do the fighting.
*  Wertheimer is alluding to the historical cycles of corruption, scandal, backlash, and then
*  reform, the cycles that we've seen in the United States for more than a century.
*  I'd like to believe we're moving into the backlash and reform part of the cycle.
*  The mad as hell and not going to take it anymore stage.
*  And then the next generation picks up and does the fighting that Wertheimer's generation
*  did 50 years ago.
*  And then we get all those reforms we just reviewed.
*  But I worry that the master planners have permanently broken the cycle by capturing
*  our psychology.
*  If corruption is the water in the David Foster Wallace speech, I worry there are signs we're
*  becoming a culture that vilifies those who ever dare mention the water.
*  This insidious trend started in early 2020.
*  I saw it firsthand when I was Bernie Sanders presidential campaign speechwriter in the
*  weeks before the Iowa caucus.
*  All of the presidential campaigns were doing what campaigns do, enlisting their supporters
*  to contrast their candidates records with the other contenders.
*  Our team enlisted law professor and anti-corruption advocate Zephyr Teachout, who you heard in
*  the last episode.
*  I suggested she publish an op-ed reviewing Joe Biden's close ties to corporate donors
*  and detailing how Biden rewarded those donors with legislation and proposals that would
*  help them.
*  Zephyr Teachout, a New York liberal and prominent Sanders surrogate, argues that Joe Biden has
*  a corruption problem for taking contributions from wealthy donors.
*  She writes, middle class Joe has perfected the art of taking big contributions, then
*  representing his corporate donors at the cost of middle and working class Americans.
*  The allegations were well documented.
*  In fact, Biden had long been known as the senator from MBNA, a reference to the credit
*  card company.
*  And he'd been hammered in an interview with NBC's Tom Brokaw in 2008.
*  You received $214,000 in campaign contributions from the company and from its employees.
*  At the same time, you were fighting for a bankruptcy bill that MBNA really wanted to
*  get passed to the Senate, making it much tougher for everyone to file bankruptcy.
*  But this wasn't 1973 or even 2008 when corruption was considered a newsworthy topic.
*  When Teachout resurfaced this criticism, it was 2020 after decades of the master planners
*  normalizing such pay to play corruption.
*  And so when Teachout's op-ed came out and we promoted it, it was portrayed as a scandal,
*  not for Biden, but for Teachout and for Bernie.
*  Does the campaign believe that Joe Biden has a corruption problem?
*  What the article is describing is the fact that Joe Biden has made deals with Republicans
*  repeatedly over the course of his career.
*  Nobody challenged the facts presented in the op-ed.
*  The scandal was that calling corruption corruption was apparently too impolite.
*  The Biden campaign quickly swung back and other observers suggested the attacks are
*  part of a pattern for Sanders dating back to his 2016 campaign when he faced criticism
*  for not stopping supporters from aggressively attacking opponents like Hillary Clinton.
*  This was perfectly teed up for Bernie to have his own Howard Beale moment.
*  But that didn't happen.
*  It is absolutely not my view that Joe is corrupt in any way.
*  And I'm sorry that that op-ed appeared to me.
*  This could have been a John McCain moment.
*  A moment where Bernie Sanders called bullshit and elevated pay to play corruption to the
*  center of the presidential election.
*  But Bernie backed down.
*  I was crushed.
*  I know a lot of others who were crushed too.
*  If even Bernie Sanders, Mr. Anti-Citizens United, couldn't talk about corruption in
*  honest and blunt terms, then who could?
*  Of course, the press corps and the political class breathed the sigh of relief that manners
*  had been restored.
*  I think it was Elton John who once said sorry seems to be the hardest word.
*  For whatever reason last night, Bernie Sanders could say it.
*  Yeah, and it sounded good to a lot of people.
*  Civil discourse, it's a good thing.
*  Seems rare these days.
*  Hooray for civility.
*  I'm sure the master planners were thrilled that the C word, corruption, had been banished
*  from the discourse.
*  But that wasn't the end of the attempt to turn corruption into a dirty, unspeakable
*  word.
*  Two years later.
*  A Texas oil tycoon is suing Beto O'Rourke.
*  Billionaire Kelsey Warren is seeking a million dollars in damages from the Democratic nominee
*  for Texas governor.
*  The controversy in the 2022 Texas gubernatorial contest revolved around a 2021 winter power
*  outage in the state during a surprising cold snap.
*  For months now, O'Rourke has been making accountability for last year's deadly power outages, his
*  key tenant of his campaign.
*  O'Rourke focused on one energy giant in particular that made big money during the crisis.
*  O'Rourke has said that one company in particular is Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners.
*  It did make $2.4 billion in profit and O'Rourke says that its CEO, Kelsey Warren, later gave
*  Abbott a $1 million campaign donation.
*  All of that is factual.
*  Okay, so if it's factual, then what's the problem?
*  In a 16-page lawsuit, Kelsey Warren now says these accusations go well beyond the sorts
*  of vague and generalized accusations and political and corporate corruption that are
*  often thrown around.
*  Warren says that O'Rourke is suggesting that he did something illegal, but Beto argues
*  that he is being silenced.
*  The case was ultimately dismissed a year later, and so you might say, hey, no harm, no foul,
*  right?
*  Wrong.
*  The Beto O'Rourke case was an intensification of the trend that had started with the Bernie
*  situation in 2020.
*  Talking about corruption won't just get you criticized and get you pressured to issue
*  a sad apology.
*  It became an actionable offense that a billionaire can use to drag you into court and sue you
*  for a million dollars.
*  And even if you win, you might end up buried in legal bills.
*  Boy, that escalated quickly.
*  I mean, that really got out of hand fast.
*  Yes, it did, Ron Burgundy.
*  And this effort to erase the issue of corruption from the political discourse, it's still escalating.
*  In early 2024, this happened.
*  After failing to advance the general election in the California's U.S. Senate race, Congresswoman
*  Katie Porter is now claiming that the race was rigged by billionaires.
*  On social media last night, she thanked supporters for voting, posting, quote, we had the establishment
*  running scared, withstanding three to one in TV spending and an onslaught of billionaires
*  spending millions to rig this election.
*  Porter's comments were statements of the obvious.
*  Yes, a super PAC funded by crypto billionaires absolutely had spent $10 million against Porter.
*  Yes, Porter was outspent in the Senate race.
*  And yes, getting outspent often sways election results.
*  But when Porter dared to call that out in unvarnished terms, it was whipped up into
*  a controversy.
*  Orange County Democrat Katie Porter now facing backlash within her own party after she said
*  billionaires spent millions to rig the election.
*  Porter made very clear that she wasn't pulling a Donald Trump and denying the election results
*  or alleging voter fraud.
*  But that didn't matter.
*  The news media, which is supposed to be a watchdog against corruption, it went on the
*  attack with a barrage of headlines slamming Porter.
*  Here's CNN joining the dogpile.
*  Katie Porter, a Democratic congresswoman, complained in her concession speech and since
*  and on Twitter saying her campaign had to withstand quote, an onslaught of billionaires
*  spending millions to rig this election.
*  Let me just state that's not what rigging an election is.
*  The whole thing was an attempt to control language as Porter's Democratic opponent,
*  Adam Schiff, made clear.
*  No Democrat should be using that language.
*  And what I think is notable is the Democratic Party quickly said, hey, you don't go there.
*  There is a real incredible difference between the parties when it comes to defensive democracy
*  but we just do not use that language.
*  Talk about slimy.
*  This attempt to equate Porter's legitimate criticism of the corrupt campaign finance
*  system with Trumpian lies, it was grotesque, but it worked.
*  And Porter backtracked.
*  I wish I had chosen a different word because big money does influence our elections.
*  Yeah, I have an additional wish.
*  I wish that we could talk honestly about corruption rather than being polite about it or shitting
*  the bed anytime someone gets mad when corruption is discussed.
*  Because if we're polite about it or simply avoid the topic, one thing is guaranteed.
*  We will never rein in corruption.
*  We will never realize any of the reforms we've discussed and the master plan will continue
*  forever.
*  Sorry to keep you waiting.
*  I apologize.
*  Good afternoon.
*  Good afternoon.
*  I'm about to head to New York for the annual UN General Assembly.
*  Two years ago, President Joe Biden called a White House press conference to discuss
*  a light topic, the future of America.
*  I want to speak with you very briefly about a vote in Congress this week that addresses
*  a serious problem facing our democracy, in my view.
*  Biden proceeded to point to reporting from our journalists at the lever, as well as ProPublica
*  and the New York Times, reporting that had just exposed the largest dark money transfer
*  in American history that you heard about earlier in this episode, the $1.6 billion that was
*  secretly transferred to Federalist Society leader Leonard Leo's network.
*  The public only found out about this $1.6 billion transfer because someone tipped off
*  some of your reporters.
*  Otherwise we still wouldn't know about it.
*  But now we know there's something we can do about it.
*  Biden said the revelations proved why the U.S. Senate had to pass the Disclose Act
*  to force the disclosure of all the dark money buying seemingly everything in Washington.
*  Republicans should join Democrats to pass the Disclose Act and get it on my desk right
*  away.
*  Biden concluded by invoking the memory of the last campaign finance reformer who had
*  led a successful fight against the master planners.
*  Getting dark money out of our politics has been a bipartisan issue in the past.
*  My deceased friend John McCain spent a lot of time fighting for campaign finance reform.
*  For him it was a matter of fundamental fairness and he was 100% right about that.
*  Ultimately this comes down to public trust.
*  Dark money erodes public trust.
*  We need to protect public trust.
*  I remember when this happened in 2022 because a lot of people contacted me congratulating
*  the lever on our reporting that Biden cited.
*  But honestly I kind of eye rolled the White House speech because I'd already made up
*  my mind about Joe Biden a long time ago.
*  I'd seen him help his pharmaceutical industry donors and his Wall Street donors.
*  He was the senator from MBNA, the guy who helped his credit card industry donors crush
*  millions of debtors.
*  I'd viewed him as Mr. Corruption for most of my adult life.
*  But as we were finishing up two years of research for this podcast, I stumbled onto some old
*  tape that kind of blew me away.
*  It's prompted some difficult questions that I can't get out of my mind.
*  Inherent in the system that we have to run for elective office is corruption within the law.
*  This is 1973.
*  Watergate was raging.
*  The Powell memo was beginning to go viral.
*  And somehow Joe Biden had just done something unthinkable.
*  As basically a nobody underdog, he defeated a two-term incumbent and had won a U.S. Senate
*  race at age 29.
*  He was now appearing at the Cleveland City Club for one of his first speaking events
*  as a senator.
*  He proceeded to tell the assembled power brokers, donors and elites something they probably
*  didn't want to hear.
*  We're not going to begin to make an encroachment on moral wrongdoing in government until we
*  elect men and women to office who are their own men and women unfettered by influence
*  from interest groups, whether they be business or labor, until they don't have to come back
*  to you and beg for money to run.
*  Biden shared some revelations he had from his own Long Shot campaign.
*  Had in the beginning when I started, big corporations or big labor or big wealthy individuals
*  or big anybody come along and said, here Biden, we want to contribute $20,000 to you, I probably
*  would have taken it.
*  Not probably, I would have taken it.
*  Because I had to go out and borrow $20,000 and put a second mortgage on my house to get
*  that 20 to start.
*  So what's the answer?
*  We support the federal funding of federally elected offices.
*  Biden's support for public financing of elections came right from his personal experience running
*  for office without access to big money.
*  And soon after this Cleveland speech in 1973, Biden helped add a public financing provision
*  to a bill that passed the US Senate later that year.
*  Side note, it died in the House.
*  Once after that happened, he sounded off at an event televised by PBS.
*  The system does produce corruption and I think implicit in the system is corruption when
*  in fact whether or not you can run for public office and it costs a great deal of money
*  to run for the United States Senate even for a small state like Delaware, you have to go
*  to those people who have money and they always want something.
*  Biden then implied that money's influence in politics was threatening to turn America
*  into an oligarchy where a handful of big donors control the entire electoral process.
*  How long is the American public going to put up with a small group of men and organizations
*  determining the political process?
*  I wasn't expecting to end this whole series thinking about Joe Biden, but I think there's
*  something profoundly important here.
*  Biden's political career has spanned the entire 50 year history of the master plan and hearing
*  Biden back in the 1970s makes his recent White House speech about the Disclose Act
*  seem more authentic.
*  But it also makes me wonder how a politician who can voice such blunt and taboo truths
*  about corruption, how can that same politician also swim for so long inside that corrupt system?
*  What does that mean?
*  What does it mean that there's the Joe Biden who says in the 1970s,
*  the system does produce corruption.
*  And 50 years later, there's that same Joe Biden saying,
*  there's much too much money that flows in the shadows to influence our elections.
*  And yet there's also the Joe Biden who did this.
*  You received $214,000 in campaign contributions from the company and from its employees.
*  At the same time, you were fighting for a bankruptcy bill.
*  And there's the Joe Biden who was rightly lampooned on late night TV for doing this.
*  Biden spoke at a private fundraiser earlier this week and told the big donors that he
*  didn't want to demonize the wealthy and added that under his presidency, no one's standard
*  of living will change.
*  Nothing will fundamentally change.
*  What does it all mean?
*  The cynic in me says that it means nothing more than Joe Biden is a professional politician
*  who periodically said some nice stuff about campaign finance just for show, but who got
*  swallowed by the system.
*  Once the senator from MBNA, always the senator from MBNA.
*  And maybe that's true.
*  God knows I'm not here to try to convince you what to think about Joe Biden.
*  But here's the thing.
*  Maybe two things can be true at the same time.
*  Maybe it's also true that Biden embodies a much more significant truth about something
*  way, way bigger than just Joe Biden, a truth about the system and about our responsibility
*  to force the system to change.
*  Maybe Biden is the older fish in the David Foster Wallace speech asking, how's the water?
*  And maybe his contradictions prove that even if people inside the system can see the corruption
*  all around us and lament that it's destroying our country and really want to do something
*  about it, maybe they still can't single handedly do much if we keep blindly swimming along
*  and don't force them to act.
*  Maybe it's on us to stop giving politicians a pass when they sell out.
*  And maybe we should stop letting them off the hook even if we like them and even if
*  we voted for them.
*  Maybe it's on us to produce enough righteous anger and outside pressure to force real change.
*  Biden seemed to make this very point in another speech that I found when I was digging through
*  archives of his career.
*  It was late in the second term of the Obama administration when Biden was vice president.
*  He was speaking to a big group of young people.
*  Let me ask you a rhetorical question.
*  If you could do only one single thing, only one to increase fairness, equity, opportunity
*  for middle class, pass rational gun control, deal with immigration, etc.
*  What would it be?
*  I can tell you what one thing I would do.
*  Get private money out of political process.
*  Biden concluded that all this corruption created by the master planners had become a democracy
*  crisis.
*  What are we doing?
*  We're cutting off access for so many of you, for so many bright young minds who the only
*  way they can get engaged is you have to go where the money is.
*  And where the money is, there's almost always implicitly some string attached.
*  Biden wondered aloud about whether if he was starting out in today's world of huge money,
*  if he could have ever gotten elected to the Senate like he did back in 1972.
*  He asked those kids in the audience to keep demanding the kind of campaign finance reforms
*  that he had pushed.
*  I don't want you to get discouraged.
*  I don't want you to get discouraged.
*  I promise you, if you keep doing what you're doing, if you generate and increase your numbers,
*  if you never apologize for your passion, if you always gird yourself against the temptation
*  to rationalize, if you're actually willing to listen to the other side to generate a
*  This could all get done.
*  And then came what sounded almost like a plea, like a cry for help from deep within the swamp itself.
*  We badly, badly, badly need you.
*  So don't get despondent.
*  Don't disengage.
*  Disrupt the status quo.
*  Make noise.
*  Take everybody on.
*  And don't ever settle for it can't be done.
*  God bless you all and may God protect our truth.
*  Whether you love or hate Joe Biden doesn't matter.
*  This is not about Joe Biden or any other politician.
*  It's about the bigger truth.
*  This democracy badly needs all of us.
*  The master planners will win if we all disengage and let politicians, including Biden himself,
*  off the hook.
*  But if we don't settle, if we do make noise, if we do take everybody on, including the
*  politicians that we think are our friends, then we do still have a chance to disrupt
*  this crushing and corrupt status quo.
*  And we do still have a chance to create a different future, a better one.
