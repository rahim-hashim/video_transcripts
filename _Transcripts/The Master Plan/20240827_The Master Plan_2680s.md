Video Description: There’s a lost tale behind Watergate: corporate bagmen, suitcases of illegal cash, and Nixon circumventing the very campaign finance rules he’d just signed into law. Amid the blowback, Nixon leaves a ticking time bomb in the heart of Washington.

*  The Lever. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=29.92s)]
*  People of consequence are questioned on the issues of our time by Elizabeth Drew on 30 Minutes With. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=34.08s)]
*  It was September 7th, 1972, about seven months after President Richard Nixon had signed the Federal Election Campaign Act. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=45.68s)]
*  30 Minutes With was a weekly public affairs program that broadcast on a newfangled TV network called PBS. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=54.0s)]
*  Tonight, John D. Ehrlichman. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=61.72s)]
*  Mr. Ehrlichman, as the top assistant to the president for domestic affairs, I'd like to ask you some questions, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=64.36s)]
*  beginning with what the Nixon administration might do if it's re-elected and has four more years in office. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=70.92s)]
*  The host, Elizabeth Drew, was a Washington correspondent for The Atlantic Monthly. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=76.6s)]
*  Her bouffant hairdo and bright green blouse created a stark contrast to the man in the dark suit sitting across from her. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=81.4s)]
*  Like all political journalists, Drew had been closely following the various scandals and questionable activities [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=88.56s)]
*  cropping up around President Nixon in the months since he had signed the nation's first major anti-corruption legislation in decades. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=95.28s)]
*  You gave an interview to the Christian Science Monitor earlier this year, and you said that in his campaign, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=103.52s)]
*  the president was going to be able to point with pride to having, quote, gotten Washington away from the Bobby Baker syndrome. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=108.64s)]
*  Bobby Baker was Lyndon Johnson's top senadate who had to resign in 1963 in a bribery scandal. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  Drew is basically asking if Nixon kept his promise to drain the swamp. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=121.4s)]
*  There have been various controversies now around this administration, the break in of the Democratic headquarters at the Watergate. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=126.6s)]
*  Do these things keep the president from pointing with pride to this sort of thing in the campaign? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=133.36s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=137.56s)]
*  As far as the Watergate thing is concerned, I know just about as much about it as you do, probably less. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=138.76s)]
*  Except I do know very definitely that people in the government, in the White House particularly, are simply not involved in that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=144.24s)]
*  Yeah, you heard that right. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=151.8s)]
*  No involvement with Watergate, according to John Ehrlichman. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=153.6s)]
*  The Nixon aide, who America would soon learn, was literally the man who oversaw Watergate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=157.16s)]
*  But here we are just months before the 1972 election. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=163.36s)]
*  And Ehrlichman is appearing on television to portray the Nixon administration as good government reformers, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=167.28s)]
*  an argument bolstered by Nixon having recently signed the campaign finance reform bill. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=174.4s)]
*  And I think after the history of this first term is written and you look back, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=179.68s)]
*  you're going to see that compared to other administrations or by any standard you'd want to apply, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=183.6s)]
*  that it has been an extraordinarily clean, corruption-free administration because the president insists on it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=189.04s)]
*  That's exactly what I think of when I think of the Nixon administration, clean and corruption-free. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=195.92s)]
*  Ehrlichman here is trying to whitewash the White House in a performance that goes way beyond spin. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  This is an early version of the cover-up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  While Nixon may have publicly signed that campaign finance bill, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  behind the scenes, the administration was neck deep in corruption and was working hard to keep it under wraps. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  This series is about the master plan to legalize corruption in America, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=222.96s)]
*  a plan that first emerged from the cauldron of Watergate. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=227.36s)]
*  Pieces of that Watergate story will sound familiar, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=231.44s)]
*  but in this episode, we're going to tell you things you've probably never heard before. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=234.4s)]
*  Think of this moment in 1972 as the opening salvo in a long game that stretches to the moment we're living in right now, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=239.44s)]
*  a game with wins and losses, where some of the players are trying to shore up protections against corruption, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=247.52s)]
*  while others are seeking ways to remove those guardrails. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=253.68s)]
*  I'm David Sirota, and this is Master Plan. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=257.76s)]
*  If you've been listening to Master Plan and thought this stuff sounds familiar, it's because today we live in a world controlled by money, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=277.52s)]
*  and it's corrupting everything from the food we eat to the movies we watch. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  And each week on Lever Time, we expose how they did it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=301.12s)]
*  I'm Arjun Singh, and every week David Sirota and I host Lever Time, the Lever's weekly business and politics podcast. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=304.56s)]
*  To listen, search for Lever Time wherever you get your podcasts, or go to levernews.com. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  It's 1972, five months before Ehrlichman's interview on 30 Minutes With, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=317.52s)]
*  and just a few days before key parts of the Federal Election Campaign Act are set to take effect. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  The men began arriving at Dulles International Airport on the edge of Washington, D.C. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=344.0s)]
*  It was springtime in the nation's capital. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=349.04s)]
*  Those guys arriving at the airport were carrying bags, briefcases, satchels, attache cases were popular, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  and their bags were filled with money, literally stuffed with cash, lots of cash. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=359.12s)]
*  From the airport, they drive directly to the same place, 1701 Pennsylvania Avenue, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=366.08000000000004s)]
*  just one block away from the White House. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=372.24s)]
*  Where were they going? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=374.8s)]
*  The Office of the Campaign to Re-elect the President, C-R-E-E-P. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=376.16s)]
*  Yes, Richard Nixon's campaign was called Creep, pretty on brand. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Inside of Creep's office, workers were frantic. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=387.76s)]
*  Political campaigns are used to dealing with large amounts of money, but this was very different. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=391.12s)]
*  Yeah, you really can't make this stuff up. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=396.64s)]
*  One day, a top executive from Pennzoil showed up at Creep and handed over $150,000 in cash [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=399.2s)]
*  and $550,000 in checks and stock certificates. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=405.36s)]
*  This is master plan producer Laura Krantz. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=409.36s)]
*  There was a New Jersey financier that sent over a worn leather bag with $200,000 of neatly wrapped [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  $100 bills. Howard Hughes's rep dropped off blank checks for the campaign to fill in themselves. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=418.4s)]
*  How do I get one of those? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=426.15999999999997s)]
*  I know, right? And get this, in just one two-day period, Creep handled about $6 million. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=427.28s)]
*  That's about $45 million in today's money. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=433.52s)]
*  No surprise that much of that money was coming from the kinds of donors who wanted political [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=436.55999999999995s)]
*  favors from the Nixon White House. From approval of mergers to get out of jail free cards to the [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=441.28s)]
*  dairy price supports that you heard about in episode one. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=446.55999999999995s)]
*  Right, but David, you just said that Nixon had already signed FICA. Wasn't it supposed [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  to limit donations and make info about them public? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=455.04s)]
*  It was, but Creep had found a way to get around the guardrails. And the mastermind of all this [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=457.92s)]
*  was G. Gordon Liddy. If you're even remotely familiar with Watergate, you know who this guy is. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=464.24s)]
*  The bald, crazy-eyed former FBI agent with the bristle brush mustache. The guy who would hold [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=470.32000000000005s)]
*  his hand over a candle to show his tolerance for pain. He's known for coming up with the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=475.92s)]
*  Watergate burglary. But what most folks don't know is that he was also the architect of this [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=480.96s)]
*  incredibly bold plan to get around campaign finance laws. It actually was amazing, if highly sketchy. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  Officially, Liddy was the general counsel for Creep. The guy whose job it was to make sure the [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=494.0s)]
*  committee followed the law. But we got ahold of this memo he wrote to the White House about [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=499.03999999999996s)]
*  using a loophole to get around the new law. Here's how it worked. Nixon signed FICA into [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=504.15999999999997s)]
*  law on February 7th, but the campaigns still had 60 days before they had to follow the new [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=510.4s)]
*  disclosure requirements. Liddy suggested that Creep use this gap between the end of the old [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=516.64s)]
*  disclosure laws and the beginning of the new ones as a magical window of no campaign finance [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=523.12s)]
*  disclosure requirements at all. A window that would make it legal for Nixon's donors to secretly dump [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  completely anonymous bags of cash onto the campaign. Liddy's scheme ended up not being as [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=536.4s)]
*  much of a secret as Nixon's team might have wanted. The New York Times ran a front page story about it [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=542.0799999999999s)]
*  with a line that said, quote, President Nixon's chief campaign fundraiser has been urging [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=547.04s)]
*  contributors to make their gifts to Republicans before the law takes effect on April 7th. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=551.76s)]
*  The story also mentioned a letter from the Nixon campaign that told donors how to get around [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=557.28s)]
*  reporting their contributions. Once word got out about the Nixon campaign's free for all [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=562.72s)]
*  fundraising scheme, other campaigns began following suit, both Republican and Democrat. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=568.0s)]
*  But no one was doing it at the scale of Creep, and the legality of it was questionable. I mean, [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=573.9200000000001s)]
*  the strategy did come from G. Gordon Liddy, not exactly the most upstanding guy. And then, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=580.08s)]
*  of course, headlines like this one started hitting the airwaves. The Democratic National Committee is [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=586.1600000000001s)]
*  housed in the fashionable Watergate complex. The break-in was apparently planned well in advance. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=591.2s)]
*  What you might not have known is that some of that anonymous money going into Creep during [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=596.6400000000001s)]
*  the magical window funded the Watergate break-in and provided hush money for the burglars. At the [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=601.76s)]
*  time, no one outside of Nixon's inner circle knew what the money was being used for. This would be [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=608.08s)]
*  uncovered later during the Watergate investigations. The burglary and the subsequent cover-up were the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=613.5200000000001s)]
*  sexy side of that scandal, the stuff Hollywood latched onto. So that's what we all remember today. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=619.2s)]
*  But the secret campaign money was the real foundation of Watergate. It illustrated how [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=624.96s)]
*  deep the corruption problem still ran, even after Congress was shamed into passing FICA. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=630.48s)]
*  And at least one set of people were aware of that corruption problem. The campaign finance watchdogs [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=636.0s)]
*  who had led the fight to pass FICA in the first place. Those watchdogs wanted to know who had [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=642.16s)]
*  donated all that money flowing into Nixon's campaign. Anonymous, remember? Only Nixon and [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=648.24s)]

*  thousands of documents, all in an effort to see what the U.S. military has kept from the public [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=740.88s)]
*  for years. Did you think that a war crime had been committed? I don't have any opinion on that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=747.04s)]
*  Season three of In the Dark is available now wherever you get your podcasts. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=753.6s)]
*  Okay, so anonymous money poured into Nixon's campaign thanks to G. Gordon Liddy's scheme, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=764.56s)]
*  and a few months later Nixon's aide John Ehrlichman appeared on PBS in that interview you heard at the [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=770.16s)]
*  top of the episode, the one where he insisted the Nixon White House was a corruption-free zone. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=775.68s)]
*  In preparation for that interview, Ehrlichman met with Nixon in the Oval Office, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=781.76s)]
*  and Nixon seemed particularly interested in one guy. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=786.56s)]
*  This recording, like many of Nixon's White House tapes, is difficult to make out, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=794.0s)]
*  but you can hear Nixon say the name John Gardner. Who is John Gardner? He'd been a cabinet official [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=804.64s)]
*  under Nixon's predecessor, Lyndon Johnson, but more recently he'd founded a citizens advocacy [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=811.84s)]
*  group known as Common Cause. We want public officials to have literally millions of American [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=817.36s)]
*  citizens looking over their shoulders at every move that they make. That's John Gardner describing [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=822.88s)]
*  the mission of Common Cause. Side note, Nixon reportedly asked Gardner to be his vice presidential [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=829.04s)]
*  running mate in 1968. Gardner declined and then became one of Nixon's least favorite people. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=834.96s)]
*  They probably wouldn't have been a good match anyway. Gardner was committed to making political [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=841.04s)]
*  institutions more open and accountable, and Nixon was committed to, well, the opposite. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=845.68s)]
*  Common Cause wanted to know who had donated to the Nixon re-election campaign during that disclosure [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=852.0s)]
*  free window in the spring of 1972. Since no one in the White House was divulging any information, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=857.68s)]
*  Common Cause filed a federal lawsuit. Gardner spoke about it at a press conference on September 6th, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=864.56s)]
*  the day before Ehrlichman and Nixon met in the Oval Office. In recent months, citizens have been [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=870.64s)]
*  treated to several highly questionable instances of huge sums flowing to the president's political [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=875.76s)]
*  campaign while government favors flowed in the opposite direction. Perhaps the instances were [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=882.08s)]
*  all coincidental. The way to dispel the aura of mystery and suspicion is to bring all the facts [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=888.48s)]
*  out into the open. That is the purpose of our suit. Creep thought they'd found a loophole that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=895.52s)]
*  allowed them to temporarily raise millions of dollars anonymously. Common Cause discovered a [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=900.96s)]
*  loophole to their loophole and found a way to use an older campaign finance law against them. This [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=906.96s)]
*  might seem like boring legalese, but national news picked up the story because it was directly [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=913.36s)]
*  connected to Watergate. The courts will have to say if such a suit under the old corrupt practices [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=919.2s)]
*  act can be won, but the administration apparently takes it seriously enough to have asked that this [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=923.84s)]
*  suit be held off. If a suit like this were won, it would clear up a lot about the Watergate bugging [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=928.48s)]
*  and more than that expose just those Nixon contributors who made their contributions before [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  April 7th in order not to be disclosed. That was on September 6th. The next morning, Nixon and Ehrlichman [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=939.84s)]
*  planned out their response in the Oval Office. This clean, corruption-free administration? [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=946.72s)]
*  It opted to go with smear tactics. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=953.12s)]
*  Yep, Nixon just called John Gardner an ass. He really hated this guy. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=971.1999999999999s)]
*  A few hours later in that PBS interview you heard at the top, journalist Elizabeth Drew asked John [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=975.76s)]
*  Ehrlichman about a brand new development having to do with donations to the Nixon campaign. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=981.76s)]
*  Common Cause filed a suit yesterday, as you know, to force the revelation of who contributed the [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=986.8s)]
*  $10 million to the president before April 7th. Do you think that that might bring about before [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=994.56s)]
*  the election any kind of revelation of who the contributor was? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1000.24s)]
*  Well, I don't think it should because I think the whole spirit of the law that the Congress adopted [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1003.2s)]
*  involved a freedom from disclosure of any contributor prior to a certain date. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1009.76s)]
*  Make note of that. Ehrlichman is arguing that the lawless period wasn't a bug. It was a feature. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1016.0s)]
*  He's arguing that the lawmakers who passed the new campaign finance disclosure law intentionally [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1022.08s)]
*  created a period to allow anonymous bags of cash to flow to the president's campaign. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1028.0s)]
*  And now these annoying campaign finance reformers want Nixon to tell America who his donors are? [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1032.48s)]
*  How dare they? Elizabeth Drew pressed Ehrlichman about this. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1037.84s)]
*  The current law said they didn't have to report before April 7th, but what Common Cause's suit said [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1041.84s)]
*  is that the Corrupt Practices Act was in effect until then, and that did require the publication [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1046.48s)]
*  of everybody who had contributed more than $100. So they say that the committee broke the law. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1052.64s)]
*  In response to this perfectly reasonable assertion, Ehrlichman whips out the smear he'd rehearsed with [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1062.64s)]
*  the president that very morning. I suspect maybe Common Cause is looking for a little [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1068.88s)]
*  rehabilitation. I understand that Mr. Gardner and his organization are in a little difficulty in [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1073.28s)]
*  terms of being able to raise money and keep alive. Maybe this is their salvation. I don't know, but [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1078.16s)]
*  they're keeping their name in the paper anyway. Bravo. Give that man an Oscar. What a performance. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1084.0s)]
*  He delivered that line even more smoothly than he had during his practice run with Nixon that morning. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1090.72s)]
*  But while Nixon officials were publicly brushing off Common Cause, behind the scenes, this was [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1096.96s)]
*  clearly a problem for the White House, and it was not going away. The issue of disclosure was [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1103.04s)]
*  central to all of this. FICA required candidates to disclose any expenditures or contributions that [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1108.72s)]
*  exceeded $100. It required disclosure reporting for candidates, political parties, and political [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1114.96s)]
*  action committees. It also required candidates to file spending reports periodically to administrative [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1121.52s)]
*  offices deep within the bowels of the Capitol. And we thought no one's going to look at them, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1126.96s)]
*  and the public is not going to find out this information if reporters don't have it before [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1131.28s)]
*  them because it would take a hell of a lot of work to review these reports. That's Fred Wertheimer, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1138.16s)]
*  who in 1972 was the young legislative director for Common Cause. He told us that to make sure the [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1144.6399999999999s)]
*  media and the public would get this information, he'd send volunteers up to Capitol Hill to buy [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1150.96s)]
*  photocopies of each report. Then they'd write up that information into press releases for each [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1156.4s)]
*  state and congressional district, sharing what campaign had received how much money and from whom. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1161.68s)]
*  Over the course of the 1972 campaign, Common Cause uncovered widespread violations of the new law [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1167.8400000000001s)]
*  and filed complaints against 128 Democrats and 98 Republicans in various congressional races. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1174.4s)]
*  It came as something of a shock to candidates to learn that someone was actually watching. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1181.52s)]
*  But Common Cause also had its eyes at the top of the ticket on the presidential race. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1187.44s)]
*  Following Creep's lead, other presidential campaigns had also amassed piles of money, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1192.48s)]
*  taking advantage of the window of lawlessness. Common Cause urged all presidential candidates [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1198.08s)]
*  to reveal their pre-April 7th donations. Having brought in so much cash in such a corrupt fashion, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1204.32s)]
*  Creep needed to keep their donors anonymous, and they had a whole laundry list of reasons [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1211.76s)]
*  explaining why. The law didn't require it. It would be unfair to donors, John Ehrlichman's argument [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1217.2s)]
*  on PBS. Other campaigns haven't done it. And even when the other campaigns did give up their donor [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1222.48s)]
*  info, Creep still refused. Here's Fred Wertheimer again. They said nuts to you. They fought us. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1228.72s)]
*  We sued Nixon and within a few weeks we got a letter from the IRS telling us they were [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1236.16s)]
*  investigating our tax status. What a coincidence! Regardless, Common Cause pushed the lawsuit forward [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1242.4s)]
*  even as election day drew closer. Facing a court order, Creep suddenly agreed to a concession. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1249.76s)]
*  They'd hand over information about donors who gave in the first two months of 1972, January and [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1256.0s)]
*  February, conveniently leaving out donations from the 60-day window. Still, when news broke [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1262.4s)]
*  that even a partial list was being released, it caused quite a stir. ABC's David Schumacher reports. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1269.2s)]
*  In this TV clip, Gardner, with reporters in tow, is marching into Creep's offices to get the first [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1275.52s)]
*  batch of information, and he's asking to see the director of press relations, Powell Moore. Mr. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1282.0s)]
*  Moore did not come right out, but a security man did, and he tried to block photographers. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1287.52s)]
*  In the black and white footage, we see a grainy hand appear over the lens, pushing the camera down. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1300.56s)]
*  The security man finally gave up, and so did Gardner. After waiting in vain for 25 minutes, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1306.08s)]
*  he walked back to his office, leaving lawyers behind to pick up their list, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1311.28s)]
*  reporters elbowing lawyers for their own copies. The news story picks up later that day at the [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1314.88s)]
*  Common Cause office, where we see rooms of young volunteers. They're sporting some quintessential [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1319.92s)]
*  70s outfits, along with handlebar mustaches, big collars, and big hair. Most of them look [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1325.6000000000001s)]
*  fresh-faced, barely out of college, as they begin to sort through the preliminary donor information [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1331.68s)]
*  they'd managed to extract from Creep. They didn't get the Holy Grail, the anonymous donor list from [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1337.0400000000002s)]
*  the secret window, but they'd gotten something. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1342.8s)]
*  Total for Chairman Gardner, just under five million dollars. Heading the list, Chicago [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1345.44s)]
*  insurance man Clemence Stone, a million dollars reinforcing rumors he's about to be appointed [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1350.24s)]
*  ambassador to Great Britain. Next, eight hundred thousand dollars from Richard Scaife of the wealthy [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1354.96s)]
*  Mellon family. Arthur Watson, former ambassador to France, gave three hundred thousand dollars. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1359.8400000000001s)]
*  John Mulcahy of New York, host to the president on his trip to Ireland, two hundred fifty five [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1365.3600000000001s)]
*  thousand. And unearthing those numbers was just the start of a tremendous amount of work. Nowadays, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1369.84s)]
*  if we get the name of some person, we just type it into an internet search and up pops the information [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1376.56s)]
*  we need. But these Common Cause volunteers in 1972 are having to search for donor identities by [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1382.24s)]
*  furiously flipping through giant phone books and reference periodicals. They're calling operators [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1389.1999999999998s)]
*  in other states using rotary phones. Do you have any idea how long that takes? [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1395.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, they're tapping numbers into calculators the size of toasters. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1400.8s)]
*  They're cross checking all of this data with pencil and paper. My hand hurts just thinking about it. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1405.4399999999998s)]
*  You can see why nobody else had bothered to do this before. And this was just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1412.4799999999998s)]
*  As the media pointed out, the biggest donors had yet to be unmasked. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1418.6399999999999s)]
*  The Republicans still have not identified their contributors for the month of March, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1422.8s)]
*  the month the committee to reelect the president pushed hardest for big money. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1426.72s)]
*  The court suit on that is still to come, but there was enough information on hand for now [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1430.32s)]
*  to keep the lights at Common Cause burning through the night. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1434.72s)]
*  The disclosure came only a few days before the election and it had almost zero effect on the [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1437.84s)]
*  outcome. Nixon was reelected, defeating George McGovern in a landslide. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1443.12s)]
*  CREEP, though, still refused to turn over any information about the bags of cash from March [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1453.76s)]
*  and April during Liddy's magic window. So Common Cause continued to press their lawsuit. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1459.44s)]
*  Their lawyers spent the early part of 1973 deposing Nixon's White House and campaign officials. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1465.36s)]
*  All of them insisted that the records from the spring of 1972 had been destroyed, [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1471.84s)]
*  which was almost certainly true since CREEP officials basically moonlighted as professional [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1476.8799999999999s)]
*  document shredders. But then a campaign official let slip that one document hadn't been shredded, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1482.6399999999999s)]
*  a list of Nixon's most important contributors of all, the guys with the biggest bags of money. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1493.12s)]
*  This list was in a locked drawer in the desk of President Nixon's personal secretary, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1499.84s)]
*  Rosemary Woods, right next to the Oval Office. This document could potentially unlock everything [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1504.88s)]
*  that Common Cause wanted to know. Obtaining it became an obsession. But Secret Donor List [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1512.4s)]
*  doesn't really roll off the tongue, so they gave it a catchy nickname. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1518.72s)]
*  Fresh in the Minds of Common Cause Staff was a wildly popular psychological horror film that [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1524.8000000000002s)]
*  had come out a few years earlier about a young mother being secretly manipulated by an evil cult. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1531.2s)]
*  The mother's name? Rosemary. Just like Nixon's secretary. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1543.76s)]
*  And that's how this coveted secret list came to be known as Rosemary's Baby. It took nine months [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1549.6000000000001s)]
*  from when Common Cause filed its initial lawsuit, but Rosemary's Baby was finally [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1558.56s)]
*  delivered in June 1973. After all those court filings, motions, and counter motions, [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1564.08s)]
*  network television reported that a federal judge officially ordered the White House to turn the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1571.04s)]
*  list over. The White House confirmed today that it has a copy of the list of campaign donations [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1576.56s)]
*  received before the new April 7th reporting deadline. Assistant Press Secretary Gerald [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1581.4399999999998s)]
*  Warren insisted the president has never seen the list. And what a list it was. Really more of a [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1586.16s)]
*  book. Coming in at a whopping one and a half inches thick, it showed contributions that added up to [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1591.2s)]
*  more than 19 million dollars in undisclosed donations to Nixon's re-election fund. All in all, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1596.88s)]
*  creep raised nearly 55 million dollars. That's the equivalent of, let me get my calculator here, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1604.0s)]
*  407 million in today's dollars. An eye popping amount. And much of it had been kept a secret. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1610.8s)]
*  The attack was on every news channel. And while the FBI and the media fixated on the wrong man, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1641.52s)]
*  the real bomber was planning his next targets. Two abortion clinics and a gay nightclub. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1647.44s)]
*  The bomber would later be identified as a dedicated soldier in the white supremacist [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1653.12s)]
*  Christian Identity Movement. Through the lens of these bombings and the victims left to pick up the [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1658.32s)]
*  pieces, Flashpoint explores one of America's greatest threats, the political and religious [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1663.68s)]
*  radicalization of homegrown terrorists. Flashpoint is available now. Listen for free on [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1669.28s)]
*  Apple podcasts or wherever you get your podcasts. You already know that Secretary Richardson has [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1675.28s)]
*  asked me to prosecute the offenses growing out of the breaking into the Watergate and other related [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1682.72s)]
*  allegations. That's Archibald Cox in May 1973, accepting the job of special prosecutor with the [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1690.48s)]
*  United States Department of Justice. He's tall with a buzz cut and looks better in a bow tie than [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1697.92s)]
*  Tucker Carlson ever did. Cox would oversee the federal criminal investigation into the failed [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1703.28s)]
*  Watergate burglary, which had happened just shy of a year earlier. And his name is pretty familiar [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1709.28s)]
*  to anyone with even a passing knowledge of Watergate. And Watergate was huge. Cox understood that [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1714.4s)]
*  one investigation would be insufficient and incredibly unwieldy. This was too big and it went [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1721.2s)]
*  far beyond the bungled burglary that we're all so familiar with. So he divided the investigation [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1727.12s)]
*  into task forces. Yeah, so a few of them investigated Watergate itself, the break in, [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1732.8s)]
*  the political dirty tricks and the infamous White House plumbers efforts to stop leaks. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1737.6s)]
*  But two other task forces focused on the part of Watergate that's often forgotten, the corruption. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1743.04s)]
*  One looked at a scandal in which one of the country's largest telephone companies pledged [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1749.36s)]
*  $400,000 to the Republican Party in exchange for a favorable Nixon administration settlement [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1754.24s)]
*  in an antitrust lawsuit. And the final task force, the one that's most important to our story, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1760.64s)]
*  focused on campaign contributions. The mission of these prosecutors was straightforward. Follow [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1766.88s)]
*  the money. Just follow the money. The campaign contribution task force honed in on that dairy [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1772.88s)]
*  scandal that we talked about in the first episode, the $2 million that the Associated [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1780.1599999999999s)]
*  Milk Producers gave to Nixon's campaign in 1971. But it was that window in the spring of 1972 [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1785.28s)]
*  before FICA came into effect where the task force focused much of its attention. Who had contributed [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1792.6399999999999s)]
*  to the mountains of cash that came rolling into Nixon's reelection war chest? Were any of those [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1798.6399999999999s)]
*  donors promised government favors or threatened with government retribution if they failed to pay [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1803.9199999999998s)]
*  up? Just how legal or illegal was all of that money? Thanks to John Gardner and Common Cause, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1809.04s)]
*  the question of who had been partially answered. Those names were now in the hands of Watergate [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1816.24s)]
*  prosecutors, including a young lawyer named Roger Whitten, who spoke to us about his work during [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1822.24s)]
*  this period. I didn't know anything about any subject we were confronting when I walked in [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1827.52s)]
*  the door. For a young lawyer at the beginning of his career without any prosecutorial experience, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1833.68s)]
*  it was exciting and it was scary. The spotlight was shining brightly on us and we wanted to do [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1841.28s)]
*  it right and fairly. Whitten had been Archibald Cox's student at Harvard Law School and in 1973, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1846.72s)]
*  he joined the Watergate Special Prosecution Force. He'd be working to find any evidence of illegal [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1852.8s)]
*  campaign finance activity. It was clear fairly early on that the hush money paid to the Watergate [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1858.88s)]
*  burglars came directly or indirectly from illegal campaign contributions. But the campaign [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1864.96s)]
*  contributions task force wanted to know more about the contributions themselves. As we've heard [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1870.5600000000002s)]
*  throughout this episode, the Nixon campaign had made a big push to get as much money as possible [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1875.44s)]
*  before FICA went into effect. The reason for that push was because FICA's disclosure requirements [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1881.0400000000002s)]
*  went way beyond those of the older law, the Federal Corrupt Practices Act. And we wondered, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1886.96s)]
*  why were they so interested in making secret contributions? What were they trying to hide? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1893.1200000000001s)]
*  And that's the question we tried to answer. And in a number of cases, we were able to show that [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1898.4s)]
*  they were seeking influence by making large contributions secretly to the president's [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1905.6000000000001s)]
*  re-election campaign. The information on who had donated to Nixon's campaign came from a variety [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1911.1200000000001s)]
*  of sources. Members of CREEP, the president's personal lawyer reporting from the press corps, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1916.56s)]
*  hat tip to Woodward and Bernstein, and of course, the Rosemary's Baby List obtained by common cause. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1922.08s)]
*  Somehow this great mass of information got sorted into charges or not charges [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1928.8s)]
*  against companies and people. And who were those companies and people? [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1934.48s)]
*  I made a little list. There was the milk investigation, which had its own sub team. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1938.64s)]
*  I thought milk was healthy and clean, but it wasn't. There were a number of well-known large [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1947.8400000000001s)]
*  companies, Gulf Oil, Ashland Oil, Northrop, Phillips Petroleum, Goodyear, Occidental. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1953.8400000000001s)]
*  Since FICA hadn't yet gone into effect when this money made its way into Nixon's coffers, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1960.48s)]
*  the Watergate Corruption Task Force had to rely on older criminal statutes in order to press charges. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1965.52s)]
*  Up until this point, those laws went almost unenforced. But amid the Watergate scandal, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1971.84s)]
*  prosecutors were now going to aggressively enforce their prohibition against corporate [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1977.6s)]
*  money flowing directly into campaigns. As the prosecution began charging companies and officials, [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1982.96s)]
*  Witten says they offered leniency to corporations that came in voluntarily to self-disclose [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1988.96s)]
*  and cooperate with the investigation. We were quite open to plea bargains because, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=1994.8s)]
*  frankly, we didn't have the resources to try 20 cases. We thought also that we could accomplish [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2000.96s)]
*  a lot by holding these companies and these senior executives up to public scrutiny. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2008.24s)]
*  We live in an era where corporate executives almost never get prosecuted for anything. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2014.8799999999999s)]
*  Where bankers can rip off millions of homeowners and oil CEOs can light the climate on fire with [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2020.72s)]
*  no consequences. But notice how Witten said that back in 1973, government prosecutors looking at [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2026.4s)]
*  corruption were going after both huge blue chip companies and their individual corporate executives. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2033.44s)]
*  This is a big deal and almost unimaginable today. Watergate prosecutors were trying to send a very [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2041.1200000000001s)]
*  specific message. We were not going to just let the corporation dig into its pocket and pay. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2048.72s)]
*  The guilty pleas and the plea bargains were deterrent to others not to engage in this misconduct. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2054.56s)]
*  Because even though you're pleading guilty to a misdemeanor, it's not a high priority of a [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2061.68s)]
*  CEO of a name-brand company to go to court and confess guilt in connection with a crime. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2066.08s)]
*  On October 17th, 1973, special prosecutor Archibald Cox issued a statement indicating [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2072.16s)]
*  that both the corporations and their primary responsible corporate officers would be charged. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2078.72s)]
*  That same day, news outlets eagerly reported on the fallout. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2085.04s)]
*  Three big U.S. corporations pleaded guilty today to making each more than $125,000 [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2088.7999999999997s)]
*  in illegal contributions to President Nixon's 1972 campaign. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2094.8799999999997s)]
*  The firms are Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing, and American Airlines. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2098.96s)]
*  In court, attorney Herbert Miller said the airline pleaded guilty. Reportedly, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2104.8s)]
*  its $55,000 donation was laundered through accounts in Lebanon. Prosecutor Thomas McBride [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2108.88s)]
*  warned that he will seek tougher penalties, which could mean jail for corporation executives who do [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2114.64s)]
*  not come forward as American Airlines did. By the way, I remember being a teenager and [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2119.44s)]
*  first learning about Watergate from a TV mini-series in the 1990s that included this commercial. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2124.4s)]
*  I guess I didn't realize how on-the-nose that really was. In essence, Watergate was the first [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2135.2000000000003s)]
*  campaign finance scandal of the modern era, and it exposed incredible corporate corruption. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2141.6800000000003s)]
*  Ultimately, the Campaign Contribution Task Force obtained convictions of 19 companies [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2147.76s)]
*  and 21 executives for making illegal corporate contributions to President Nixon's campaign, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2153.04s)]
*  which then used some of that money to fund activities like the Watergate break-in. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2158.96s)]
*  Remember John Ehrlichman's claim? By any standard you'd want to apply, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2163.2s)]
*  there's been an extraordinarily clean, corruption-free administration. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2166.56s)]
*  Yeah, not so much. And then, Nixon decided to make things worse for himself. Just three days [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2171.44s)]
*  after Cox's press conference and the guilty pleas of those big companies, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2177.84s)]
*  Nixon ordered Archibald Cox to be fired. The two top men at the Justice Department refused to do it, [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2182.0s)]
*  so it fell to the third in line, Robert Bork, a name we'll hear again and again in this series. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2188.8s)]
*  The firing of Cox was part of what became known as the Saturday Night Massacre. The public was [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2196.96s)]
*  outraged. In an effort to contain the fallout, Nixon gave a televised press conference. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2202.8s)]
*  Side note, he gave this speech at Disney World, which is worth mentioning because we'll be back [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2218.48s)]
*  to the Magic Kingdom in the not-too-distant future. Bookmark Disney World. A lot of weird [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2223.6000000000004s)]
*  shit happens there. Obviously, the best way to assure people you're not a criminal is to [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2228.88s)]
*  desperately insist that you're not a criminal. Obviously. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2245.2000000000003s)]
*  But by the time Nixon delivered that now-famous line, the damage was done. Millions of Americans [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2248.7200000000003s)]
*  had been watching the nationally televised Senate Watergate hearings unfold under the [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2254.48s)]
*  leadership of Senator Sam Ervin, who honed in on the link between corruption, campaign finance, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2259.12s)]
*  and the burglary. Didn't you suspect that when you raised this money and distributed it in this [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2265.68s)]
*  surreptitious manner to the lawyers and families of the parties that had been indicted in the [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2273.12s)]
*  Watergate that you were aiding the Nixon campaign for reelection? Americans glued to their [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2279.12s)]
*  televisions heard the dramatic stories about bags of cash, political intrigue, and straight up [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2285.7599999999998s)]
*  corruption. Even before the Saturday Night Massacre, a Gallup poll confirmed that Americans [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2292.0s)]
*  considered government graft one of the most important problems facing the nation. Campaign [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2297.44s)]
*  finance and political corruption would be key issues in the upcoming 1974 midterm elections. [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2303.04s)]
*  And thanks to Nixon, the Democrats, along with a coalition of reformers and organizations like [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2309.7599999999998s)]
*  Common Cause, saw both a political opportunity and a chance to fix the system. They began pushing [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2315.68s)]
*  a package of amendments that would strengthen the 1971 Federal Election Campaign Act. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2322.24s)]
*  I think this is the single most important issue that can be resolved by this Congress. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2327.68s)]
*  Hey Laura, does that voice sound vaguely familiar? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2331.36s)]
*  No, not ringing a bell. Who is it? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2335.04s)]
*  That's Joe Biden in a televised debate back when he was a fresh-faced 31-year-old senator. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2336.88s)]
*  He was one of the lawmakers involved in passing amendments to strengthen FICA. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2343.52s)]
*  Now, it would have been delicious to see supervillain Richard Nixon shamed into [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2348.32s)]
*  signing new, even tougher anti-corruption bills into law. But he'd already thrown in the towel [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2352.7200000000003s)]
*  by the time they passed. I shall resign the presidency effective at noon tomorrow. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2358.08s)]
*  Vice President Ford will be sworn in as president at that hour in this office. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2362.7999999999997s)]
*  That left Gerald Ford holding the pen. He'd been a long-time Republican leader in the U.S. House, [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2369.04s)]
*  and Ford probably didn't like the new, tougher campaign finance legislation any more than Nixon [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2374.7999999999997s)]
*  would have. We'll hear more about old Jerry in a future episode. But the political climate meant [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2380.72s)]
*  Ford had no choice but to grit his teeth and sign the bill during a televised ceremony. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2386.32s)]
*  A major legislative outgrowth of the Watergate scandal was the campaign financing reform bill. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2392.1600000000003s)]
*  President Ford signed that into law in a ceremony today. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2397.44s)]
*  The president invited Congress into watch and about a hundred members showed up for the East [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2400.4s)]
*  Room ceremony. Among other things, the bill limits the amount individuals can contribute to [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2404.48s)]
*  candidates, puts a $20 million spending limit on presidential races, and provides some public [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2408.8s)]
*  financing of the presidential campaigns through voluntary $1 deductions which voters can take on [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2414.08s)]
*  income tax. When signing the bill, President Ford explicitly acknowledged how angry the public was [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2419.76s)]
*  at the corruption that had taken over Washington. I can assure you from what I've heard from the [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2426.24s)]
*  American people in writing and other communications, they want this legislation. So it'll soon be law. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2431.76s)]
*  We do recognize that this legislation seeks to eliminate to a maximum degree some of the influences [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2439.6s)]
*  that have created some of the problems in recent years. And if that is the end result, certainly [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2447.76s)]
*  it's worth all the labor and all the compromises that were necessary in the process. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2455.84s)]
*  Wow. What a wild trip it's been. Without the original FICA and that magical window of lawlessness, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2462.08s)]
*  those bags of secret money may never have been dumped into Nixon's campaign. Without that money [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2469.6s)]
*  and all the corruption and scandal that came out of Watergate, these reforms may never have happened. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2475.36s)]
*  If, as the old saying goes, every crisis is an opportunity, then the work of reformers and [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2481.04s)]
*  organizations like Common Cause made sure that when something as bad as Watergate happened, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2486.88s)]
*  it could become a moment for progress. Fred Wertheimer again. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2492.2400000000002s)]
*  Watergate was the trigger because the public would not have engaged. People would not have been [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2496.32s)]
*  outraged. The stories would not have been there. Look, I've worked on this since 1971. We passed [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2504.4s)]
*  the Watergate reforms in 74 because we had enormous public support and demand. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2513.76s)]
*  And so here we are once more, dear listener. The forces of corruption have been repelled. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2522.4s)]
*  The man who had come to personify corruption had been ejected from the White House in what seemed [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2527.6000000000004s)]
*  like a national referendum for a cleaner government free of big money influence. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2532.7200000000003s)]
*  But of course, we have several episodes to go. And we now live in a kleptocracy that makes [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2538.56s)]
*  Watergate seem quaint, which means this is not where the story ends. This is where the story [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2543.7599999999998s)]
*  really begins. Because even though he was forced into an early California retirement, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2550.3199999999997s)]
*  Richard Nixon had left the American people a present, a time bomb back in Washington, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2555.7599999999998s)]
*  one that was ticking away. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSSO7UDUNUs&t=2561.44s)]
