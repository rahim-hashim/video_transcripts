# Trump addresses the nation after Iran attacks US military facilities in Iraq
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg)
*  As long as I'm President of the United States, Iran will never be allowed to have a nuclear [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=0.0s)]
*  weapon. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=21.7s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=23.86s)]
*  I'm pleased to inform you the American people should be extremely grateful and happy. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=25.099999999999998s)]
*  No Americans were harmed in last night's attack by the Iranian regime. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=34.4s)]
*  We suffered no casualties. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=43.0s)]
*  All of our soldiers are safe and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=45.22s)]
*  Our great American forces are prepared for anything. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=54.9s)]
*  Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=59.18s)]
*  a very good thing for the world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=64.98s)]
*  No American or Iraqi lives were lost because of the precautions taken, the dispersal of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=68.58s)]
*  forces and an early warning system that worked very well. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=76.5s)]
*  I salute the incredible skill and courage of America's men and women in uniform. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=83.66s)]
*  For far too long, all the way back to 1979 to be exact, nations have tolerated Iran's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=89.08s)]
*  destructive and destabilizing behavior in the Middle East and beyond. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=97.84s)]
*  Those days are over. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=103.28s)]
*  Iran has been the leading sponsor of terrorism and their pursuit of nuclear weapons threatens [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  the civilized world. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  We will never let that happen. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=115.66000000000001s)]
*  Last week we took decisive action to stop a ruthless terrorist from threatening American [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=120.0s)]
*  lives. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=126.24s)]
*  At my direction, the United States military eliminated the world's top terrorist, Qassem [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=127.24s)]
*  Soleimani. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=135.92s)]
*  As the head of the Quds Force, Soleimani was personally responsible for some of the absolutely [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=139.04s)]
*  worst atrocities. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=146.44s)]
*  He trained terrorist armies, including Hezbollah, launching terrorist strikes against civilian [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=149.96s)]
*  targets. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  He fueled bloody civil wars all across the region. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=157.58s)]
*  He viciously wounded and murdered thousands of U.S. troops, including the planting of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=162.86s)]
*  roadside bombs that maim and dismember their victims. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=168.16s)]
*  Soleimani directed the recent attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq that badly wounded [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=173.52s)]
*  four service members and killed one American, and he orchestrated the violent assault on [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=179.34s)]
*  the U.S. embassy in Baghdad. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=186.82000000000002s)]
*  In recent days, he was planning new attacks on American targets, but we stopped him. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=189.56s)]
*  Soleimani's hands were drenched in both American and Iranian blood. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  He should have been terminated long ago. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=203.02s)]
*  By removing Soleimani, we have sent a powerful message to terrorists, if you value your own [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  life you will not threaten the lives of our people. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=213.5s)]
*  As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=217.52s)]
*  immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=224.36s)]
*  These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=230.74s)]
*  In recent months alone, Iran has seized ships in international waters, fired an unprovoked [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  strike on Saudi Arabia, and shot down two U.S. drones. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=243.58s)]
*  Iran's hostility substantially increased after the foolish Iran nuclear deal was signed [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=249.70000000000002s)]
*  in 2013, and they were given $150 billion, not to mention $1.8 billion in cash. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=254.58s)]
*  Instead of saying thank you to the United States, they chanted Death to America. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=267.26s)]
*  In fact, they chanted Death to America the day the agreement was signed. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=271.74s)]
*  Then Iran went on a terrorist spree, funded by the money from the deal, and created hell [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=278.46s)]
*  in Yemen, Syria, Lebanon, Afghanistan, and Iraq. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  The missiles fired last night at us and our allies were paid for with the funds made available [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=291.7s)]
*  by the last administration. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=298.62s)]
*  The regime also greatly tightened the reins on their own country, even recently killing [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=301.48s)]
*  1,500 people at the many protests that are taking place all throughout Iran. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=307.22s)]
*  The very defective JCPOA expires shortly anyway and gives Iran a clear and quick path to nuclear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  breakout. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=327.3s)]
*  Iran must abandon its nuclear ambitions and end its support for terrorism. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=329.70000000000005s)]
*  The time has come for the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Russia, and China to recognize [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=336.88s)]
*  this reality. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=344.52s)]
*  They must now break away from the remnants of the Iran deal, or JCPOA. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=346.7s)]
*  And we must all work together toward making a deal with Iran that makes the world a safer [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=353.6s)]
*  and more peaceful place. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=360.64s)]
*  We must also make a deal that allows Iran to thrive and prosper and take advantage of [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=363.18s)]
*  its enormous untapped potential. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=368.48s)]
*  Iran can be a great country. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=372.72s)]
*  Peace and stability cannot prevail in the Middle East as long as Iran continues to foment [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=374.82s)]
*  violence, unrest, hatred, and war. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=381.32s)]
*  The civilized world must send a clear and unified message to the Iranian regime. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=385.42s)]
*  Your campaign of terror, murder, mayhem will not be tolerated any longer. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=391.58s)]
*  It will not be allowed to go forward. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=398.64s)]
*  Today I am going to ask NATO to become much more involved in the Middle East process. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=404.76s)]
*  Over the last three years, under my leadership, our economy is stronger than ever before, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=413.36s)]
*  and America has achieved energy independence. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  These historic accomplishments are strategic priorities. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=422.76s)]
*  These are accomplishments that nobody thought were possible. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=427.26s)]
*  And options in the Middle East became available. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=431.34s)]
*  We are now the number one producer of oil and natural gas anywhere in the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=434.76s)]
*  We are independent, and we do not need Middle East oil. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=446.78s)]
*  of $2.5 trillion. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=451.61999999999995s)]
*  U.S. armed forces are stronger than ever before. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=454.59999999999997s)]
*  Our missiles are big, powerful, accurate, lethal, and fast. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=460.7s)]
*  Under construction are many hypersonic missiles. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=467.21999999999997s)]
*  The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean we have [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=472.32s)]
*  to use it. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=476.3s)]
*  We do not want to use it. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=478.06s)]
*  American strength, both military and economic, is the best deterrent. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=482.04s)]
*  Three months ago, after destroying 100 percent of ISIS and its territorial caliphate, we [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=488.58000000000004s)]
*  killed the savage leader of ISIS, al-Baghdadi, who was responsible for so much death, including [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=497.02s)]
*  the mass beheadings of Christians, Muslims, and all who stood in his way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=505.5s)]
*  He was a monster. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=511.44s)]
*  Al-Baghdadi was trying again to rebuild the ISIS caliphate and failed. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=513.44s)]
*  Tens of thousands of ISIS fighters have been killed or captured during my administration. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=520.42s)]
*  ISIS is a natural enemy of Iran. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=528.54s)]
*  The destruction of ISIS is good for Iran, and we should work together on this and other [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=532.0s)]
*  shared priorities. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=539.0s)]
*  Finally, to the people and leaders of Iran, we want you to have a future and a great future, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=541.0s)]
*  one that you deserve, one of prosperity at home and harmony with the nations of the world. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=551.04s)]
*  The United States is ready to embrace peace with all who seek it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=558.62s)]
*  I want to thank you, and God bless America. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=563.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=567.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=568.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=569.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ti_dZLZpTXg&t=588.62s)]
