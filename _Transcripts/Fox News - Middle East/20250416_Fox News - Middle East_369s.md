# Trump holds Situation Room meeting on Iran amid nuclear talks: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8)
*  The maximum pressure campaign on Iran continues, but as you know, the president has made it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=0.0s)]
*  clear. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  He wants to see dialogue and discussion with Iran while making his directive about Iran [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  never being able to obtain a nuclear weapon quite clear. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=10.76s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=14.0s)]
*  It's standing firm right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=15.0s)]
*  The Trump team on nuclear talks with Iran reiterating its demand that Tehran eliminate [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=16.0s)]
*  its nuclear program. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=19.88s)]
*  There was action on this. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=21.56s)]
*  We're going to bring in retired General Jack Keane, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=22.56s)]
*  General. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=26.16s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=27.16s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=28.16s)]
*  What do you think of Iran's policy on nuclear? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=59.16s)]
*  And the possibility of going nuclear? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=60.16s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think the president's policy has changed one iota. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=61.16s)]
*  I mean, I even had a conversation with him about it just prior to the inauguration, and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=66.6s)]
*  he was unequivocally clear. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=70.8s)]
*  And he has been very clear on this issue, like he is on a lot. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=72.84s)]
*  His policy is simple. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=76.52s)]
*  Iran is not going to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=78.32s)]
*  And he has put together a negotiator, the personal envoy to the Middle East, to be the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=80.52s)]
*  implementer of that. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And he has issued an ultimatum to back that envoy up. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  The ultimatum is pretty simple. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=90.36s)]
*  Iran, you voluntarily dismantle your program, eliminate the enriched uranium, hand it over, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=92.4s)]
*  destroy the centrifuges that are deeply buried in those secret facilities, and destroy the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  intercontinental ballistic missiles or ballistic missiles, excuse me, that could deliver them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=108.98s)]
*  And what President Trump has said, if you don't voluntarily dismantle and eliminate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=114.56s)]
*  the program, then we, meaning Israel and the United States, will destroy the program. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=121.28s)]
*  That's pretty simple. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=127.64s)]
*  And this got off message somehow, I think, as a result of the first talks and subsequent [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=129.24s)]
*  interviews on television. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=135.0s)]
*  I think yesterday's meeting was to get input, but also, most importantly, get clarity. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=137.0s)]
*  It seems to me, when the negotiators go before the Iranians this weekend, it's about implementing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=142.76s)]
*  the president's policy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=147.84s)]
*  And that is more, show us your plan to eliminate voluntarily your nuclear enterprise. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=150.48s)]
*  And show us the milestones to do that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=159.44s)]
*  Show us the sites that this is going to take place at. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=161.74s)]
*  And we reserve the right to go anywhere, anytime, to conduct inspections, because we know full [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=164.56s)]
*  well the Iranians would retreat. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=171.16s)]
*  It seems to me the meeting is more about getting an implementation plan than it is negotiating [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=174.36s)]
*  some terms about how much of this or how much of that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's how it got off message. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=184.24s)]
*  And recall this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=186.56s)]
*  In 2019, in Hanoi, when the Trump team went in to negotiate with Kim Jong-un, and they [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=188.08s)]
*  were expecting to see an implementation plan to dismantle his nuclear weapons, and he didn't [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  provide that, they got up and left. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=198.32s)]
*  And I think that's where we are. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=200.6s)]
*  General, on the Middle East, there is movement here on a ceasefire that's really not been [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=204.12s)]
*  joined by the other side. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=211.28s)]
*  Hamas is rejecting that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=212.44s)]
*  Here's a statement from the Israeli Defense Minister. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=214.32s)]
*  Israel's policy is clear. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  He says, no humanitarian aid is set to enter Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=217.72s)]
*  Mechanism must be built for the use of civilian companies as a tool that will also prevent [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=220.52s)]
*  Hamas from accessing this issue going forward. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=225.08s)]
*  Israel believes there are 59 hostages of which 24 are still alive, including Edon Alexander, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=228.6s)]
*  an American Israeli. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  And then, well, I guess two things happened. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=236.84s)]
*  There was a proof-of-life video given of him recently. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=239.16s)]
*  And then Hamas came out a few days later claiming it lost contact with those who were keeping [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  Edon hostage. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=247.79999999999998s)]
*  You wonder if anyone's going to come out alive, General? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=251.28s)]
*  Well, certainly, we're all hoping and praying for that. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=255.6s)]
*  But the reality is here is that Israel has put on the table, certainly, the release of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=259.28s)]
*  the hostage in exchange for prisoners. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=266.2s)]
*  But they also have been very clear to Hamas that they don't want them to remain governing, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=268.8s)]
*  and they also want them to disarm. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=275.04s)]
*  And they are not going to discuss the afterday of Hamas until those objectives are achieved. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=278.28s)]
*  So Hamas is pushing back on that because, as we know full well, keeping those hostages [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=285.28s)]
*  is all about keeping Hamas alive and also in power. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=291.08s)]
*  So we're at lagerheads here. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=296.48s)]
*  I think more negotiations will take place. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=298.32s)]
*  Listen, the pressure on Hamas is pretty significant now because new chief of the IDF military [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=302.04s)]
*  and he is posing a different plan. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=308.92s)]
*  He is occupying parts of four different parts of the Gaza Strip, and he's going to expand [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=312.0s)]
*  that occupation. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=318.16s)]
*  And he's moving the civilian population out of those four areas so he can focus on destroying [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=319.7s)]
*  Hamas in those areas and taking away any hope that they can govern in that. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=325.88s)]
*  And they are now referring to that as the security zone of the state of Israel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=330.86s)]
*  And that is very different than what the former chief of the IDF conducted, largely tactical [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=336.1s)]
*  raids and then left the area. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=341.94s)]
*  So this occupation is increasing over time and there's considerably more pressure also [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=344.46000000000004s)]
*  on Hamas to release those hostages. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=349.66s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=352.98s)]
*  It's good to have you back on, and we'll watch both of them carefully. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=353.98s)]
*  Important stuff. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=356.58000000000004s)]
*  Jack Keene, thank you. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLcjt18Bte8&t=357.58000000000004s)]
