# ‘DISGUSTING’: Tim Scott scorches ‘The Squad’ for pro-Palestine stance
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs)
*  Members of the socialist squad gathering in our nation's capital yesterday calling for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=0.0s)]
*  a ceasefire as Israel fights Hamas terrorists in Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  A ceasefire now to save lives. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=13.92s)]
*  We cannot continue to stand idly by numb as we watch this death toll climb. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=17.84s)]
*  We stand here today calling for a ceasefire because all life is precious. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=23.46s)]
*  Where is your humanity? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=29.36s)]
*  Where is your outrage? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=30.84s)]
*  Where is your care for people? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  Senator Tim Scott now calling for their expulsion, adding that the U.S. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=36.96s)]
*  cannot continue funding terrorists by sending money to Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=41.24s)]
*  He joins us now with more center. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Welcome to the show. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=48.16s)]
*  You're running for president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  We need a speaker in our house. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=50.64s)]
*  We interviewed actually a member of Congress earlier about that idea that if we had a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=54.16s)]
*  speaker of the house right now, maybe they could take action. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=57.92s)]
*  But running for president as president, would you be calling for members of Congress to be expelled? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=60.84s)]
*  Well, listen, I certainly the entire American people want those members of the squad expelled. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=66.28s)]
*  And certainly as president of the United States, I would want them out of Congress or at least [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=71.92s)]
*  taking all their responsibilities away. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  Listen, we cannot have people, the squad as a propaganda, part of the propaganda machine of Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=79.92s)]
*  You cannot have a Palestinian flag flying on American property, especially in the House of Representatives. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=87.84s)]
*  We are sending the worst message I can think of. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  You just saw we saw October the 7th, Hamas come into Israel and burn babies alive. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=99.48s)]
*  We saw beheadings. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=109.56s)]
*  We saw grandmothers taken, women raped. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=112.28s)]
*  And the response is to ask Israel for a ceasefire. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=115.84s)]
*  I hope Israel wipes Hamas off the face of the earth. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=121.72s)]
*  I'm going to tell you, America's blessings in part come from Psalms one twenty two six. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=126.52s)]
*  Pray for the peace of Jerusalem. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  I think we should mourn with those who mourn. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=134.76s)]
*  We have done that with our ally, Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=137.32s)]
*  But Romans 13 four speaks of the wrath of God brought upon people who do evil. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=140.44s)]
*  I can't think of anything more evil than the pictures of those burned little babies. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=147.28s)]
*  And to have the squad tell people to have a ceasefire, to have the squad keep up a tweet [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  that says that Israel was responsible for 500 deaths at a hospital, even though it is proven to be a lie. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=161.44s)]
*  I find their actions despicable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=170.44s)]
*  I find their conduct disgusting. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=173.04s)]
*  I find their presence as a part of the House of Representatives [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=175.51999999999998s)]
*  and the fatigual to what we stand for as a nation, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=180.44s)]
*  but as Americans, we stand against hate. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=186.72s)]
*  And that's exactly why I am leading on legislation that eliminates funding for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=189.6s)]
*  that say it is acceptable for their students to call for genocide. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=197.28s)]
*  It is acceptable for their students to support terrorism. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=202.6s)]
*  It's acceptable for their students to support murder. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=206.36s)]
*  You have free speech, but you can't be an idiot. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=210.36s)]
*  And so I think pulling the funding, the Pell grants from colleges and universities [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=213.28s)]
*  that support that kind of malignant behavior is in the best interest of every single good [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=219.2s)]
*  American who understands that funding colleges should be for the education of our kids, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=225.68s)]
*  not for the indoctrination of our kids. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=232.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you can be an idiot in America. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=235.12s)]
*  We just shouldn't have to pay for it to fund. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=236.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  To get your first amendment right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=239.48000000000002s)]
*  To teach you the right thing to teach these kids. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=240.68s)]
*  It is amazing to watch the passion of Ilhan Omar two weeks later when there was no passion. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=242.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  When Israelis were murdered in their own homes and Americans as well. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=247.32s)]
*  And I didn't hear them say a single thing about bringing our hostages home. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=252.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=257.56s)]
*  Let American hostages go. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=257.92s)]
*  I didn't hear anything from the squad telling Hamas, the murderous, evil terrorists to let Americans go. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=260.2s)]
*  I didn't hear a single word from them telling them to let the Israelis go. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=268.32s)]
*  If you want peace in the Middle East, how about have the squad get a back vote? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=273.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=278.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=278.68s)]
*  And I didn't hear those calls to release American hostages for many of the protests going around at the universities. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=279.0s)]
*  I have to tell you, Senator Scott, I'm so encouraged, but I just think we should defund all these universities. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=285.64000000000004s)]
*  They have all become indoctrination machines. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=291.16s)]
*  We should stop. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=294.56s)]
*  You know, we should start taxing those endowments and giving them all the favors that they get, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  because everything that's bad with America right now, whether it's, you know, the situation of, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=299.88s)]
*  you know, rich white kids, you know, supporting Hamas all the way to gender ideology and everything else that's happening in our country, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  it all starts with these universities, especially our Ivy Leagues. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=313.56s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=318.96s)]
*  One of the things I find challenging is if you believe in 100 genders, you have freedom of speech. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=320.0s)]
*  If you want to speak about your faith and your love for Jesus on a college campus, somehow that's called hate. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=327.15999999999997s)]
*  And you lose your First Amendment rights. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=334.52s)]
*  We as a nation, there are good people on both sides of the aisle. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=336.32s)]
*  I frankly, here's what I believe. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=340.56s)]
*  I believe that Joe Biden can't even be honest about any positions because he's beholden to the squad. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=342.56s)]
*  Political power is more important than doing the right thing for the radical left. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=350.4s)]
*  Control is more important than doing the right thing. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=356.6s)]
*  And frankly, they'll use race, class and even genocide from the squad in order to hold on to political power. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=361.0s)]
*  And it is disgusting. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=373.44s)]
*  And they invoke scripture as well, which, you know, coming from these, you know, radical pro-abortionists, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=375.68s)]
*  I'm not going to be scripture lectured by them. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=382.72s)]
*  But, you know, all good stuff. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=386.16s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Scott. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=387.96s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLDeouP9ACs&t=389.48s)]
