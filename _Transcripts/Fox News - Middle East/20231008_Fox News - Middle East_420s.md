# Hamas is the ‘little brother’ to Hezbollah, expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g)
*  Well, Eric, right now we want to bring in Lieutenant Colonel Sarit Jahavi. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=0.0s)]
*  She's founder and president of the Alma Research and Education Center in Israel, also served [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=3.84s)]
*  in the IDF's intelligence corps for 15 years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=9.76s)]
*  We'll get to that part later. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=14.0s)]
*  But, first, I want to start here, if I can. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=15.0s)]
*  Listen, part of Hamas' plan was taking civilian hostages. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  And, of course, there's concern that more of the terrorists are embedded in Israel right [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=20.68s)]
*  now poised to take more hostages. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=26.5s)]
*  So how does this factor into how Israeli defense forces retaliate, and how can they get the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=29.12s)]
*  hostages home safely? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=35.92s)]
*  I want to ask, to start with a question. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=40.08s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  I saw your titles here down in the screen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  When Japan attacked United States Imperial Harbor, who declared war? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=47.8s)]
*  Japan or United States? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=53.72s)]
*  This is a declaration of war by terrorist organizations getting the orders from Iran [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=56.52s)]
*  against the state of Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  It's not a declaration of war, but a state of Israel. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=62.800000000000004s)]
*  Now I will answer your question about what the retaliation should be. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=66.16s)]
*  The retaliation should be as massive as possible to make a very clear message to Hamas and [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=71.04s)]
*  a very clear message to Hezbollah up north that this is unacceptable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  If 600 Israelis killed, maybe more, it means that every Israeli knows somebody who was [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=84.36s)]
*  killed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=89.88s)]
*  All of us are bearing the dead. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=90.88s)]
*  Nobody was asleep yesterday. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=92.36s)]
*  Everybody is recruited, and everybody here is next to shelters, while complete communities [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=95.28s)]
*  are being evacuated from the southern border and from the northern borders. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=100.2s)]
*  Families were massacred in their homes. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=106.12s)]
*  IDF is now making the preparations to make sure that it will be able to meet the Iranian [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=109.08s)]
*  vision of multi-front scenario against the state of Israel, a scenario that the Iranians [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=117.24s)]
*  made the preparations in the past two years. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=123.64s)]
*  I myself saw the Hezbollah on the border building military positions following me and IDF soldiers [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=126.36s)]
*  every day in the past two years, in opposed to United Nations Security Council resolutions [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=133.36s)]
*  that were made in the past on the border, I mean on the Lebanese border. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=140.68s)]
*  I'm speaking to you 12 kilometers from the Lebanese border. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=143.4s)]
*  We are under threat here as well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=147.36s)]
*  So this was very important for me to clarify. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=149.96s)]
*  And I appreciate that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=156.08s)]
*  So given what you just told me, a couple of questions for you, then, and I don't ask this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=157.08s)]
*  in any accusatory tones at all. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=161.36s)]
*  You mentioned how you, as an IDF member, you've been followed for a long time now. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  They were tracking you. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=171.48000000000002s)]
*  So how is it that this attack was able to be pulled off in such a surprising way? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  And then also, you mentioned you're there near Lebanon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=179.48000000000002s)]
*  Are you concerned? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=183.12s)]
*  You just heard Trey Yank's report that Hezbollah has already raised its ugly head, that they're [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=184.12s)]
*  ready to jump in should this war expand. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=189.56s)]
*  This is a big ball of mess. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=193.12s)]
*  How do you handle this? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=195.76s)]
*  How does IDF handle this? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=196.76s)]
*  How do Israeli allies, of course the U.S. and others? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=198.95999999999998s)]
*  Look, as an ex-intelligence officer, I can tell you that to give an alert when the enemy [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=203.16s)]
*  is standing at the fence prepared, and in the past two weeks we've seen provocations [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=210.64s)]
*  and the fence in Gaza all the time. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=217.2s)]
*  This is normalization of the provocations until eventually they cross and they damage [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=221.2s)]
*  security measures and defense. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=226.72s)]
*  It's really more and more difficult to give specific alert if you don't have strategic [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=229.72s)]
*  information or intelligence about intentions to actually go to war, is what happens. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=235.6s)]
*  So I truly don't know what happened in this specific case. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=241.2s)]
*  These things will be clear later, and of course there is a lot of questions here inside Israel [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=244.96s)]
*  about intelligence and operational functioning, but I can totally identify with the intelligence [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=250.92s)]
*  challenge here when we speak about an active front that was not quiet in the past few weeks. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=258.2s)]
*  As to your question of the North, we woke up this morning to an anti-tank attack of [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=266.4s)]
*  Hezbollah against an IDF position, anti-tank missiles that were fired from a school inside [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  Lebanon not far from the Israeli border. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=280.08s)]
*  I don't know what was the damage. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  I know that the target was, the targeting was accurate. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  And this is now kind of a situation here of expectation, expectation to see things coming [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=291.52s)]
*  down in the South, inside Israel especially, finishing to clear the communities and catching [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=299.96s)]
*  and killing all the terrorists that invaded into Israel. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=309.56s)]
*  And on the other hand, expectation to see what will happen up North, whether Hezbollah [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=313.79999999999995s)]
*  is planning to join Hamas the same way Hamas did. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=320.56s)]
*  And I must tell you, Hamas is considered a little brother, while Hezbollah is the big [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=326.28s)]
*  brother. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  Hezbollah has commando forces named Radwan Brigades. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=332.35999999999996s)]
*  These are 2,500 terrorists that, well trained, are actually well experienced from the war [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=338.32s)]
*  in Syria. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=346.55999999999995s)]
*  And these guys, these terrorists are deployed on the Israeli-Lebanese border in the past [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  year and a half. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=352.67999999999995s)]
*  That's very concerning. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=355.44s)]
*  Just before I go, if you could, do you have any idea of how IDF might be able to get the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=357.2s)]
*  hostages home free and safe? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=363.2s)]
*  Or free them and get the hostages home? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=367.16s)]
*  Well, I must tell you, in this respect, I'm sorry, the less talking the better. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=368.16s)]
*  We don't even know how many exactly were taken hostage. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=374.68s)]
*  And this is a situation that we've never experienced with regard to 100 hostages. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=380.24s)]
*  I guess international pressure is extremely needed here. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=386.8s)]
*  Arab pressure is extremely needed here. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=391.2s)]
*  I believe that not all of them are holding only Israeli citizenship, probably more citizenships [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=394.36s)]
*  there. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=401.64s)]
*  And we would need help around that, this is clear. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=403.2s)]
*  We will need international pressure here. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=405.96000000000004s)]
*  I hear you loud and clear. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=410.36s)]
*  Thank you very much, Lieutenant Colonel Sarit Shahavi. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=412.68s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=415.76s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqvtGMeh41g&t=417.36s)]
