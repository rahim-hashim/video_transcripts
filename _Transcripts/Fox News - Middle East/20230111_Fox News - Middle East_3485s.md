# Karine Jean-Pierre holds White House briefing | 1/11/2023
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8)
*  Whatever Monday you want is yours. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=0.0s)]
*  OK, so again, good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1.84s)]
*  Please bear with me. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=4.0600000000000005s)]
*  There's been a lot of news, so I have a few things at the top. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=5.9s)]
*  So with respect to the FAA system outage [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=9.42s)]
*  that occurred early this morning, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=12.3s)]
*  the safety of Americans is the top priority [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=14.38s)]
*  of the president, the Department of Transportation, and the FAA. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  DOT and FAA report that yesterday, they [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=20.14s)]
*  were working through issues in the NoTAM system, which [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=23.22s)]
*  is used to communicate key safety information [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=26.42s)]
*  about runways and flight patterns with pilots. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=29.82s)]
*  To be clear, we're not talking about air traffic control here, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=33.2s)]
*  but we still consider this to be a vital safety system as well. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=37.32s)]
*  So FAA staff continued to work through the night to resolve the outage [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  and issued a ground stop at 7.25 AM this morning, which [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=47.8s)]
*  lasted for approximately 90 minutes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=52.24s)]
*  FAA lifted the ground stop once the NoTAM system [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=55.6s)]
*  was available again, which means that the critical safety information [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=58.88s)]
*  required to resume travel was indeed available. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  The president was briefed this morning by Secretary Buttigieg [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=66.26s)]
*  before departing for Walter Reed with the First Lady, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=69.58s)]
*  as you heard directly from the president on the South Lawn [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  this morning for yourselves. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=75.98s)]
*  As we shared this morning as well, we do not [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=77.9s)]
*  have evidence that this outage was caused by a cyber attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=80.38s)]
*  The FAA is working aggressively to get to the bottom of the root [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=84.78s)]
*  causes for the system outage so that it does not happen again. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=88.5s)]
*  Bless you, Emily. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=96.12s)]
*  OK, so yesterday, the Department of Education [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=98.4s)]
*  proposed what would be the most affordable student loan [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=100.56s)]
*  repayment plan in history. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  The new plan, if implemented, will cut monthly loan payments [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  in half for undergrad borrowers. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=109.56s)]
*  It will mean borrowers making less than about $30,000 per year [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  will not have to pay a dime on their student loans each month, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=116.0s)]
*  and it will reduce the time it takes for low balance borrowers [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=120.38s)]
*  to get their student loan debt forgiven. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=124.26s)]
*  The proposal delivers on the plan President Biden announced in August [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=126.9s)]
*  to provide millions of borrowers with more affordable monthly student loan [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=130.34s)]
*  payments, giving them additional breathing room to start a family, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=134.66s)]
*  buy a car, and purchase a home. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=138.7s)]
*  Today, we have further evidence of President Biden's economic plan [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=141.16s)]
*  delivering for American workers. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=144.82s)]
*  QCELS, a major Korean solar manufacturer, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=147.04s)]
*  announced it will invest more than $2.5 billion [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  to expand their plant in Dalton, Georgia, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=153.73999999999998s)]
*  and to build a new plant northwest of Atlanta. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=158.6s)]
*  This investment will create 2,500 jobs in Georgia [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=161.9s)]
*  and represent the single largest investment [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  in solar manufacturing in the United States. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=167.56s)]
*  In its announcement, QCELS emphasized that Inflation Reduction Act [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=171.94s)]
*  was critical to making this investment possible. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=175.89999999999998s)]
*  This builds on the more than $25 billion in major investments [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  in Georgia in electric vehicle and battery manufacturing, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=184.42s)]
*  solar manufacturing, construction materials, and more [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=187.29999999999998s)]
*  since the president took office. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  When the president talks about building our economy from the bottom up [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=192.42s)]
*  and middle out, this is exactly what he is delivering. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=196.17999999999998s)]
*  More investments, more jobs, more manufacturing in America. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=199.52s)]
*  In gun safety news, Illinois has now become the ninth state across America [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=204.24s)]
*  to pass an assault band's weapon and take bold action [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=208.92s)]
*  to keep weapons of war off America's street. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=212.32s)]
*  President Biden commends the leadership of Illinois's Governor J.P. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  Pritzer, House Speaker Chris Welk, Senate President Don Harmon, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=219.64s)]
*  Representative Bob Morgan, and the numerous advocates, survivors, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=224.32s)]
*  and elected officials whose tireless efforts turned [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=228.82s)]
*  the pain of Highland Park and other acts of violence [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=231.76s)]
*  into meaningful action on behalf of all of the people who live in Illinois. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=236.28s)]
*  As you've heard from me before, President Biden [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=241.56s)]
*  has taken historic action to reduce gun violence, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=245.0s)]
*  including signing the Bipartisan Safety Communities Act last summer. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=248.28s)]
*  And he has continued to press for more action [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=253.12s)]
*  to keep our homes, schools, and communities safe, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=255.32s)]
*  including federal laws requiring background checks for all gun sales [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=258.09999999999997s)]
*  and a ban on assault weapons and high capacity magazines. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=262.34s)]
*  In the meantime, the president continues to urge other states [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=267.58s)]
*  to join California, New Jersey, Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=270.7s)]
*  New York, Delaware, Washington DC, and now Illinois [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  to ban assault weapons at the state level to save lives. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=280.7s)]
*  And finally, a quick note on yesterday's special election in Virginia. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=285.14s)]
*  We congratulate Aaron Rouse for his win in Virginia's seventh district, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  a district previously held by a Republican. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=296.96s)]
*  He made his campaign clear about the choice Americans across the country [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=301.3s)]
*  have between extreme MAGA Republican policies that would take away women's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=306.09999999999997s)]
*  ability to make their own health care decisions, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=310.97999999999996s)]
*  and Democrats focused on expanding access to reproductive care [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=313.76s)]
*  and lowering costs for American families. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=317.8s)]
*  It's not just in Virginia. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=320.24s)]
*  This was, of course, a critical issue in the midterms elections, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=322.12s)]
*  as many of you reported. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=325.44s)]
*  And in their first slate of bills, House Republicans [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=327.44s)]
*  are prioritizing legislation that would amount to a national ban on abortion. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=330.4s)]
*  It's not just tone deaf. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=334.84s)]
*  As Republican Congresswoman Nancy May said herself, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=337.08s)]
*  it's extreme, out of touch with the beliefs of the majority of Americans [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=340.2s)]
*  around the country. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=344.28s)]
*  The president knows that women's ability to make their own health care decision [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=345.56s)]
*  is non-negotiable, and we will continue to fight to make that cause, that case, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=350.32s)]
*  at the state and federal level. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=356.03999999999996s)]
*  And one final note, on Friday, ahead of the president's trip [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=358.28s)]
*  to Atlanta this weekend, we will have a special guest in the briefing room. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=360.91999999999996s)]
*  We'll have a senior advisor for public engagement. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=364.84s)]
*  Keisha Lance Bottoms will be joining us, will be joining me, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=368.68s)]
*  to talk about some of her work, as well as preview [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=371.76s)]
*  the significance of the president's remarks at Ebenezer Church [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=374.76s)]
*  on what would have been Martin Luther King Jr.'s 94th birthday. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=378.16s)]
*  With all of that said, you guys can start waking up now. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=382.88s)]
*  Zeke, why don't you take us away? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=387.68s)]
*  Thanks, Brian. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=389.24s)]
*  I'm hoping you brought an update on what the president has been doing at Walter Reed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=390.36s)]
*  while the first lady has been undergoing this procedure. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=394.0s)]
*  You saw the first lady just got out of her escape a couple minutes ago, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=395.92s)]
*  what has the president been doing? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=398.66s)]
*  He's going to skip the PDB. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=399.66s)]
*  What time did that happen? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=401.38s)]
*  He was up there. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=402.38s)]
*  So I'll say this and be very simple. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=403.34000000000003s)]
*  Today is about his wife. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=405.62s)]
*  That is the focus for the president right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=407.22s)]
*  As many of you know, the president accompanied the first lady [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=409.26s)]
*  to Walter Reed National Medical Center for her scheduled outpatient procedure, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=412.22s)]
*  commonly known as mouse surgery. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=416.98s)]
*  The first lady's procedure is proceeding well. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=420.38s)]
*  And as expected, Dr. O'Connor will provide an update about her today. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=423.1s)]
*  But again, this is about the president supporting his wife of 45 years. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=427.78s)]
*  And so again, when it comes to her condition specifically, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=434.26s)]
*  Dr. O'Connor will have more to share. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=437.78s)]
*  But again, I'm not going to go beyond how important it [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=439.42s)]
*  is for the president to be there with his wife today. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=442.46s)]
*  Thanks, and a couple specific questions regarding the discovery of apparently [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=445.02s)]
*  documents marked class five in the president's former office. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=449.18s)]
*  The president acknowledged yesterday that he had been briefed, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=451.94s)]
*  that those documents had been found. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=454.66s)]
*  When was he briefed that those documents had been found? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=456.06s)]
*  So let me just lay this down a little bit, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=458.22s)]
*  because just for folks who happen to not be following this. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=460.54s)]
*  Look, the president addressed this issue yesterday. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=464.3s)]
*  He addressed it in Mexico City on a world stage in front of many of you [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=466.82000000000005s)]
*  at a press conference with two of our closest neighbors, as you all know. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=473.62s)]
*  And he said he takes classified documents and information seriously. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=477.62s)]
*  He was surprised to learn any records had been found there. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=482.1s)]
*  He doesn't know what was in them. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=486.26000000000005s)]
*  He said this, just repeating what the president has said. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=488.18s)]
*  As soon as his lawyers realized these documents were there, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=491.02000000000004s)]
*  they did the right thing and immediately turned them over to the archives. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=493.90000000000003s)]
*  As he said, his team is cooperating fully with the review. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=498.8s)]
*  And we also released a statement from the White House counsel's office, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=503.86s)]
*  as you know, on Monday, which had detailed information [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=507.58s)]
*  about the particular situation. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=513.38s)]
*  As my colleagues in the council have stated and said to all of you [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=515.38s)]
*  yesterday, this is an ongoing process under the review [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=518.74s)]
*  of the Department of Justice. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=521.66s)]
*  So we are going to be limited on what we can say here. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=522.8199999999999s)]
*  But as the president told you, as my colleagues have said to many of you, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=526.26s)]
*  we are committed to doing the right thing, doing this in the right way. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=530.38s)]
*  And we will provide further details when it's appropriate. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=534.66s)]
*  Craig, you mentioned you want to do this the right way. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=538.1s)]
*  Presumably, that means the transparent way. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=540.26s)]
*  So my question was, when was the president briefed? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  He said he was briefed. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=544.26s)]
*  When did that briefing happen? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=544.98s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to get into details. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=546.18s)]
*  I'm not going to get beyond what the president shared yesterday. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=547.9s)]
*  He laid out what he knew, when he knew it. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=550.8199999999999s)]
*  He laid out how important it is. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=554.2199999999999s)]
*  He sees it very seriously when it comes to taking classified documents [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=556.5799999999999s)]
*  and information. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  I'm just not going to. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=563.3399999999999s)]
*  I know you all are going to have a lot of questions on this. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=564.38s)]
*  But at this time, I'm not going to go beyond what the president said [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=567.06s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=570.3s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what my colleagues from the White House [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=570.66s)]
*  Council shared with many of you as well on Monday. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=573.34s)]
*  And so I'm just going to leave it there. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=578.3s)]
*  I want to be prudent here and make sure that my colleagues really, truly [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=579.86s)]
*  handle this issue. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=586.46s)]
*  Should I add one more stab at this? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=587.42s)]
*  Because again, this is of a lot of importance to people. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=588.84s)]
*  The president mentioned that handling of classified information is important. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=592.74s)]
*  These documents were discovered on November 2nd. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=595.5s)]
*  This didn't come public until my colleague at CBS News [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=597.9s)]
*  reported this on Monday. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=602.1800000000001s)]
*  That's more than two months later. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=604.3000000000001s)]
*  Why was the public not informed while the White House prepared [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  a PR response for two months? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=610.3000000000001s)]
*  Again, this was under review. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=611.74s)]
*  This is under review by the Department of Justice. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=613.74s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what the president shared yesterday. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=615.82s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what my colleagues at the White House Council [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=618.34s)]
*  shared with all of you as well. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=621.94s)]
*  Look, what you received from the White House Council on Monday [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=624.1800000000001s)]
*  had complete details, a lot of details to all of you on what occurred. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=628.82s)]
*  And just not going to get beyond that. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=634.0600000000001s)]
*  It is, again, an ongoing process. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=636.78s)]
*  We're going to respect the process. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=638.66s)]
*  As the president said, his team handled it the right way. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=641.0600000000001s)]
*  And we're just not going to get ahead of the process from here. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=644.58s)]
*  Thanks, Greta. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=647.7s)]
*  Have you spoken to the president about these documents and their discovery? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=648.2s)]
*  I have not spoken. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=652.3s)]
*  Well, first of all, I have not spoken to the president [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=653.38s)]
*  about any of this specifically because he's laid out what he knows. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=656.1s)]
*  He has said he doesn't know what is in them. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=662.18s)]
*  So there's no way for me to talk about the documents if he has said [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=665.22s)]
*  he doesn't know what's in them. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=667.98s)]
*  And we're just going to allow the process to continue. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=669.78s)]
*  So for the sake of the American public who want these questions asked [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=672.54s)]
*  and answered, would the president characterize [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=675.58s)]
*  what happened here as a mistake? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=677.5s)]
*  Would this White House characterize this as a mistake? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=678.9s)]
*  What I'll say is this is an ongoing process. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=681.02s)]
*  You heard from the president. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=683.22s)]
*  He spoke about this in detail yesterday on a world stage, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=684.22s)]
*  in front of many of you who were there, in front of many of your colleagues. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=689.0600000000001s)]
*  He laid out what he knew. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=694.3000000000001s)]
*  He said that he takes this seriously when it comes to classified documents, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=697.82s)]
*  when it comes to information that is classified. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=703.26s)]
*  He was surprised to learn about the records had been there. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=706.3399999999999s)]
*  And again, he believes that the lawyers did the right thing, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=711.26s)]
*  and they immediately turned them over to the archives. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=717.14s)]
*  And the president is saying that he was surprised to learn about these documents. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=719.5799999999999s)]
*  Is he saying that he did not bring those documents to that office? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=722.18s)]
*  I'm just not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=725.9799999999999s)]
*  Do we know who did bring those documents to the office? [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=728.18s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=730.0999999999999s)]
*  But you're saying you want to be transparent, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=731.4599999999999s)]
*  do things the right way, or not point again anymore? [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=733.26s)]
*  And his team of lawyers did do that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=736.42s)]
*  They did the right thing by turning over the documents to the archives. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=738.46s)]
*  That's what they did once they realized that they were there. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=743.9s)]
*  It's not clear, Kareem, how the documents got from the White House [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=748.62s)]
*  to this office. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=751.94s)]
*  Steve, I appreciate the question. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=753.86s)]
*  It's under review. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=755.3000000000001s)]
*  I'm going to let the DOJ do their process. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=756.54s)]
*  I'm just not going to get ahead of it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=759.7s)]
*  Back on the FAA outage, has cyber totally been ruled out? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=761.26s)]
*  Right now, that is what I said. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=766.06s)]
*  This has not been viewed as a, there's no evidence of a cyber attack [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=768.9399999999999s)]
*  at this point. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=772.9399999999999s)]
*  The president has directed Department of Transportation [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=774.02s)]
*  to conduct a full investigation into the causes [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=777.14s)]
*  and provide regular updates. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=779.86s)]
*  Again, this is incredibly important, a top priority, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=781.78s)]
*  the safety of Americans who are flying every day. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=784.5s)]
*  We want to make sure that they're safe. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=787.34s)]
*  This is a top priority for the president, top priority [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=789.02s)]
*  for the Department of Transportation, and certainly FAA. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=791.02s)]
*  And so we want to make sure that we get to the root causes [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=794.46s)]
*  so this does not happen again. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=798.14s)]
*  Lastly, on the First Lady, when was this legion discovered? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=799.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of what Dr. O'Connor is [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=803.9s)]
*  going to share later today. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=806.9399999999999s)]
*  I stated that the procedure is going well. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=809.22s)]
*  I'm just going to leave it there and let [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=811.98s)]
*  her doctors speak to it. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=813.74s)]
*  On the documents case, again, you've [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=817.22s)]
*  laid out that the president's lawyers and the special counsel [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=819.54s)]
*  are dealing with the legal side of this. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=822.18s)]
*  You've now laid out that you have not [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=824.06s)]
*  had a conversation with the president about this. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=825.62s)]
*  But this was reported Monday. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=828.78s)]
*  It happened in November. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=830.78s)]
*  Are you aware of any conversation in the West Wing [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=832.18s)]
*  among others, people other than the president, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=834.54s)]
*  about disclosing this once it was discovered? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=838.66s)]
*  What I can say is somebody, I was asked by a colleague, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=842.38s)]
*  if we talked about the documents themselves, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=846.8199999999999s)]
*  the president said he does not know what was in them. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=850.42s)]
*  But also, just wanted to clear that up. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=855.22s)]
*  Look, I understand you guys are going [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=857.3399999999999s)]
*  to have a lot of questions on this. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=858.88s)]
*  I get that. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=860.18s)]
*  I know you guys are going to have a lot of questions [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=860.74s)]
*  on process and specifics. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=862.9s)]
*  And what I can tell you is that I'm not [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=864.54s)]
*  going to go beyond what the president laid out. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=867.66s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what my White House counsel colleagues [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=869.62s)]
*  have stated. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=873.38s)]
*  I would refer you to them for any other specifics [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=874.34s)]
*  or additional information. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=877.86s)]
*  I want to be prudent here. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=879.6600000000001s)]
*  I want to make sure that we do this in the appropriate way. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=881.1800000000001s)]
*  But we're going to ask them, because that's our job. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=884.5400000000001s)]
*  I understand. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=886.74s)]
*  And my job is to answer your questions. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=887.5400000000001s)]
*  So here we go. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=889.38s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=890.34s)]
*  One of the reasons we ask this is [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=890.84s)]
*  because on day two of this administration, when [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=892.14s)]
*  he swore all of you in, the president said, quote, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=894.02s)]
*  I'm going to make mistakes. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=896.94s)]
*  When I make them, I'll acknowledge them, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=898.58s)]
*  and I'll tell you. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=901.1800000000001s)]
*  And I'll need your help to help me correct them. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=902.5s)]
*  So you're the one here talking to us about this. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=904.9s)]
*  That's why we're asking you. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=908.26s)]
*  So let's just remember that. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=909.5s)]
*  When he was just yesterday. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=911.7s)]
*  Ed, we don't need to have this. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=912.98s)]
*  We work very well together. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=915.98s)]
*  We don't need to have this kind of confrontation. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=918.02s)]
*  Ask your question, and I will answer them the best [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=920.46s)]
*  that I can. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=922.82s)]
*  Part of the reason we're laying that out [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=923.46s)]
*  is because you're laying out your part of the job. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=925.34s)]
*  We're laying out our part of the job. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=927.34s)]
*  I know. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=928.18s)]
*  But I'm just saying that we don't need to have contentious. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=928.5s)]
*  You don't need to be contentious with me here, Ed. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=930.94s)]
*  The president was asked yesterday, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=933.0600000000001s)]
*  but did not answer this part of the question. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=934.3800000000001s)]
*  Why didn't he or someone in the White House [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=936.3000000000001s)]
*  inform the American people when these documents were [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=937.86s)]
*  discovered on November 2? [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=940.0600000000001s)]
*  Did it have anything to do with the fact that the election was [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=941.2600000000001s)]
*  just a few days away? [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=942.94s)]
*  Because people are asking this part of it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=943.9000000000001s)]
*  Did it have anything to do with the fact [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=944.1800000000001s)]
*  that the election was just a few days away? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=945.5s)]
*  Again, Ed, this is under review by the Department of Justice. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=947.46s)]
*  It is literally under review right now. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=950.3000000000001s)]
*  As I am talking to you, it is under review. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=952.5400000000001s)]
*  So I'm not going to get beyond the process. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=956.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to get beyond what the president said. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=959.5s)]
*  Look, the White House counsel, my colleagues in the White House [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=961.58s)]
*  counsel laid out a very detailed information [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=964.46s)]
*  about this particular issue on Monday. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=968.3s)]
*  You all have that. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=971.5s)]
*  I'm just not going to get beyond that. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=973.18s)]
*  The Department of Justice is independent, as you know. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=974.82s)]
*  They're doing a review. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=977.38s)]
*  And I want to be prudent here. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=979.26s)]
*  And it would be more appropriate. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=980.82s)]
*  It would be more appropriate for my colleagues [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=982.9s)]
*  in the White House counsel's office to address this. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=985.62s)]
*  And then we walk in under the briefing room, [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=989.1s)]
*  and we hope they can come soon to discuss this. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=990.5400000000001s)]
*  But here's another thing. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=992.1800000000001s)]
*  There was nothing stopping the president of the United States [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=993.5s)]
*  from disclosing the discovery of these classified documents [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=996.78s)]
*  in his former office before it was under Justice Department [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=999.34s)]
*  review. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1003.0600000000001s)]
*  What I can tell you right now is share with you [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1004.7s)]
*  what the president said to all of you, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1010.4200000000001s)]
*  which is he was surprised by this. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1013.1800000000001s)]
*  He definitely, truly respects the process here. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1015.2199999999999s)]
*  And also, when it comes to classified, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1019.8599999999999s)]
*  he takes classified documents very seriously. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1021.9399999999999s)]
*  And again, I'm going to leave you to the information [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1024.58s)]
*  that the president provided to all of you, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1027.6599999999999s)]
*  and also just yesterday in front of many of you [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1029.58s)]
*  or your colleagues, and also what my White House counsel [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1033.3s)]
*  colleagues shared on Monday. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1036.86s)]
*  The leaders of the Senate Intelligence Committee [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1038.34s)]
*  today, like they did after the raid at Mar-a-Lago, [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1040.62s)]
*  have asked that the director of national intelligence [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1043.74s)]
*  conduct a national security assessment [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1045.74s)]
*  of this apparent discovery of classified information. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1047.5s)]
*  Has the president asked for one? [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1052.02s)]
*  Or are you aware of the ODNI? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1053.54s)]
*  I would refer you to Department of Justice here. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1054.78s)]
*  This is, again, this is- [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1056.74s)]
*  Department of Justice doesn't handle national security. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1057.78s)]
*  I would refer you to Department of Justice [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1059.26s)]
*  on this particular issue that's being reviewed currently. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1061.02s)]
*  On whether the office of director [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1063.38s)]
*  of national intelligence is conducting a national security [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1064.98s)]
*  When it comes to the review that we are currently [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1067.1s)]
*  speaking of right now of these classified documents, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  I would refer you to Department of Justice. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1072.46s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1074.26s)]
*  The Press. Apart from those classified documents, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1074.98s)]
*  the president did say that he was unaware of records [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1077.3000000000002s)]
*  being brought to that specific office. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1081.26s)]
*  So aside from those, has he asked his lawyers, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1082.78s)]
*  has he looked into whether any other documents [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1086.5s)]
*  have been taken to any other office that he has, [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1090.5800000000002s)]
*  whether in Wilmington or Rehoboth? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1095.42s)]
*  Has there been any kind of, like, audit [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1098.1000000000001s)]
*  that's been done of where he may, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1100.1399999999999s)]
*  where there may be others that he doesn't know about? [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1103.54s)]
*  I'm just not going to speak to this. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1105.8999999999999s)]
*  I'm going to let the process continue. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1107.1399999999999s)]
*  It's an ongoing process. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1109.62s)]
*  And so I'm just not going to speak to this from here. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1111.2199999999998s)]
*  It is more prudent and more appropriate [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1114.98s)]
*  for my colleagues at the White House Council [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1117.34s)]
*  to speak to this. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1119.3799999999999s)]
*  On another note, you were touting the QCELS announcement [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1120.78s)]
*  and the Inflection Reduction Act. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1124.2199999999998s)]
*  I just want to ask, though, you know, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1126.6599999999999s)]
*  Governor Kemp in Georgia is also touting the deal [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1128.1s)]
*  and taking credit for it. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1132.6999999999998s)]
*  Did the administration work with the Republican governor [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1134.5s)]
*  to get this project off the ground? [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1137.58s)]
*  How much help was he in this process? [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1140.02s)]
*  I don't have any specifics to share on our conversations [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1144.26s)]
*  with the governor of Georgia, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1148.58s)]
*  but what I can share with you is what we have said many times [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1150.6599999999999s)]
*  is how important the Inflation Reduction Act is here. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1153.4599999999998s)]
*  And we see this. We see this in many of the announcements [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1156.54s)]
*  that we've seen clearly across the country [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1160.42s)]
*  when it comes to making sure that we're lowering costs [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1163.02s)]
*  for Americans, making sure that we're bringing manufacturing [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1167.46s)]
*  jobs back home. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1170.8999999999999s)]
*  And this is part of, more broadly, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1172.3799999999999s)]
*  the president's economic policy. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1173.74s)]
*  And so we see this a lot. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1175.7s)]
*  We see where Republicans do not support [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1177.1s)]
*  some of the major critical policies [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1179.94s)]
*  like the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1181.74s)]
*  but then take credit for it, like the American Rescue Plan, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1183.3s)]
*  but then take credit for it. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1185.74s)]
*  But that also shows you how effective [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1186.98s)]
*  the president's economic policy has been [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1189.5800000000002s)]
*  and how it does indeed work and deliver for the American people. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1191.7s)]
*  And so I'll just leave it there. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1195.26s)]
*  The President does talk about bipartisanship. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1196.46s)]
*  I mean, did Governor Kemp help? [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1198.3400000000001s)]
*  He does. I just said I don't have anything to lay out for you, [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1201.74s)]
*  but what I'm sharing with you is what we have seen over [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1204.1000000000001s)]
*  and over again when it comes to Republicans [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1206.6200000000001s)]
*  who do not support what we're trying to do [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1208.6200000000001s)]
*  on behalf of the American people. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1211.26s)]
*  Again, the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1212.5800000000002s)]
*  Again, the American Rescue Plan, right, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1214.46s)]
*  which is all part of the president's economic policy, [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1216.38s)]
*  which has shown to have worked, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1218.98s)]
*  which has shown to actually create 10 million, [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1221.54s)]
*  more than 10 million jobs, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1225.3400000000001s)]
*  which have actually helped to lower, help lower in cost. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1226.9s)]
*  When you think about the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1230.9s)]
*  as we're going to move forward in implementing that. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1232.8600000000001s)]
*  So all of these things are incredibly important. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1235.14s)]
*  I'm just laying out to you [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1237.02s)]
*  that the president's economic policy is working. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1238.22s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1240.26s)]
*  —Credin, when you were talking about the FAA, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1241.46s)]
*  you said that the issue arose [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1243.06s)]
*  as they were working through some issues. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1246.02s)]
*  And so I was wondering if you could explain a little more [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1248.94s)]
*  if basically the FAA was trying to update the system, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1250.98s)]
*  or was there a server issue, a database issue? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1254.22s)]
*  If you have any more detail on how exactly, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1257.46s)]
*  you know, prior to the full investigation, [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1260.8600000000001s)]
*  this seems to have happened. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1263.02s)]
*  —So I would refer you to the Department of Transportation. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1264.26s)]
*  Secretary Buttigieg has been on many of your colleagues' [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1268.58s)]
*  airwaves speaking about this and what occurred. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1271.78s)]
*  He has directed an after-action process [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1274.22s)]
*  to determine exactly the root causes [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1277.1s)]
*  and recommend the next steps. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1278.98s)]
*  FAA and DOT will continue to be transparent here [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1280.62s)]
*  about the causes of the issue [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1284.1399999999999s)]
*  and how we will ensure a system outage of this magnitude [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1285.98s)]
*  does not happen again. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1289.58s)]
*  So what I said earlier, which is very true, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1290.62s)]
*  our number one focus is to make sure [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1293.62s)]
*  that the safety of Americans who are flying, right, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1295.18s)]
*  we want to make sure that they're safe. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1297.74s)]
*  And the second part of this is to make sure [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1299.1s)]
*  that this does not happen again. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1301.1s)]
*  And so, again, there's going to be an after-action process [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1303.18s)]
*  and we'll move from there. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1305.78s)]
*  —I asked about this gas stove thing [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1306.86s)]
*  that kind of bubbled up yesterday. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1308.82s)]
*  Does the White House think gas stoves are safe? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1311.58s)]
*  And I know that the Consumer Product Safety Commission [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1314.18s)]
*  said today that they're not looking to ban gas stoves, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1316.94s)]
*  but I'm wondering, was there communication [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1319.82s)]
*  between the White House and the— [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1321.22s)]
*  —So as far as the safety piece of it, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1322.38s)]
*  it's not something for us to answer from here. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1324.22s)]
*  I would refer you to the Consumer Product Safety Commission. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1326.66s)]
*  As the chair said today, and I quote, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1331.66s)]
*  research indicates that emissions from gas stoves [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1333.3400000000001s)]
*  can be hazardous, and the CPSC is looking for ways [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1335.74s)]
*  to reduce related indoor air quality hazards. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1339.7s)]
*  But to be clear, I am not looking to ban gas stoves, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1342.5s)]
*  and the CPSC has no proceedings to do so. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1346.0600000000002s)]
*  Look, as far as our conversation with—to your question, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1351.8600000000001s)]
*  we are in regular touch with them, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1355.8999999999999s)]
*  but of course they are independent. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1357.1s)]
*  They were independently correcting the record [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1361.02s)]
*  on this for several days now, and so as far as I'm aware, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1363.1399999999999s)]
*  we're not in touch with them on this particular issue. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1366.1399999999999s)]
*  Again, I would refer you to their comment. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1370.06s)]
*  —Quick one. Russia announced today [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1373.02s)]
*  that they're replacing their military chief in Ukraine. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1374.8999999999999s)]
*  They've installed a Kremlin loyalist there. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1378.02s)]
*  I'm wondering if you have a reaction to this [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1380.6999999999998s)]
*  and what you think it says about sort of the state of the conflict. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1382.4599999999998s)]
*  —So, look, I'm going to let the Kremlin [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1385.42s)]
*  speak to their leadership decision. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1386.94s)]
*  But as an outside observer, as we all are here, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1389.38s)]
*  they sure have a lot of changes. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1392.42s)]
*  They made a lot of changes as they continue to try [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1395.8600000000001s)]
*  to overcome their own difficulties in a war [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1398.8200000000002s)]
*  that they shouldn't happen in the first place. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1401.74s)]
*  So again, I'm not going to comment for them. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1403.9s)]
*  I'll certainly let the Kremlin speak for themselves. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1406.0200000000002s)]
*  But again, this is a war that they started. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1408.18s)]
*  This is a war that they created, a brutal war, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1410.7s)]
*  and they can end it today if they choose to do so. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1413.5s)]
*  —The other stuff is Ukraine. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1415.9s)]
*  —Thank you, Karine. I have two questions for you. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1417.22s)]
*  Last week, President Biden said that the war in Ukraine [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1419.86s)]
*  is at a critical point, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1422.82s)]
*  and then you repeated the statement from this podium. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1424.66s)]
*  So I'm wondering, where does this assessment come from, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1429.02s)]
*  and why the White House thinks that the war in Ukraine [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1432.9s)]
*  is at a critical point right now? [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1438.3s)]
*  And secondly, Poland announced today plans [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1440.82s)]
*  to send a company of Leopard tanks to Ukraine [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1443.6599999999999s)]
*  as part of international coalition. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1448.6599999999999s)]
*  Does the U.S. support such a coalition? [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1451.54s)]
*  And is President Biden considering [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1455.86s)]
*  sending American Abrams tanks to Ukraine to help, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1457.9399999999998s)]
*  especially if he thinks that the war is at a critical point? [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1463.4199999999998s)]
*  —So I'll say this. Look, Russia has been attacking Ukraine [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1467.6200000000001s)]
*  for 10 months now, 10 months. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1472.1000000000001s)]
*  And this winter, we're seeing a new approach by Putin, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1474.42s)]
*  targeting civilians. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1478.02s)]
*  You've heard the President talk about that specifically. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1479.14s)]
*  It is unspeakable what the Ukrainian people are enduring, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1481.8200000000002s)]
*  and they are bravely fighting back. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1485.5s)]
*  I'll say this to your second question. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1487.8600000000001s)]
*  The President has made clear to President Zelensky, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1490.9s)]
*  as you know, he was here very recently. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1494.78s)]
*  You saw them stand side by side, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1496.46s)]
*  and you heard the President talk about the commitment [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1499.14s)]
*  that he has for the Ukrainian people, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1501.1000000000001s)]
*  and that the U.S. will continue to have their back, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1504.06s)]
*  stand with Ukraine as long as it takes. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1506.58s)]
*  And we've been very clear and consistent on that. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1509.18s)]
*  We are moving fast and delivering to support Ukraine [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1511.82s)]
*  with the tools it needs to win this war. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1515.94s)]
*  We just announced a PDA of $3 billion, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1518.8600000000001s)]
*  the largest one, just last week. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1522.1000000000001s)]
*  And so that is going to continue. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1524.18s)]
*  Again, we will be with them as long as they need us. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1525.78s)]
*  I'm going to move on. I'm going to move on. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1529.58s)]
*  I'm going to move on. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1531.34s)]
*  The Press. Thank you, Kerry. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1532.54s)]
*  Do you have a reaction to Majora [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1534.82s)]
*  potentially increasing the price of its COVID vaccine by 400 percent? [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1536.3s)]
*  I don't have a response to that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1541.7s)]
*  I would have to check in with the team. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1543.58s)]
*  This is the first I'm hearing about this. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1544.82s)]
*  And separately, do you have a reaction [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1546.42s)]
*  to Governor Krasantsev a couple days ago [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1549.74s)]
*  about planning to activate the National Guard [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1552.14s)]
*  in respect of Florida National Guard [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1556.5800000000002s)]
*  in response to the Cuba migration surge? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1558.3000000000002s)]
*  So we have known for some time now, right? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1563.26s)]
*  We have seen Governor DeSantis do political stunts. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1565.8200000000002s)]
*  That is how he perceives to fix this issue from Florida, right? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1568.98s)]
*  And he takes — you know, we're talking about people [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1575.3000000000002s)]
*  who are coming from countries who are dealing with political strife, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1579.54s)]
*  who are dealing with issues where they're trying to find asylum, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1584.18s)]
*  and he treats them like pawns. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1589.58s)]
*  And so we have called that out over and over again, [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1591.98s)]
*  and we will continue to do that. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1594.38s)]
*  And he is not dealing with the problem. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1596.3s)]
*  He's actually creating a problem. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1598.46s)]
*  And so that's what I have to say to that. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1600.74s)]
*  We've talked about Governor DeSantis and, again, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1602.78s)]
*  the mockery that he's making of a process [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1606.46s)]
*  that the president is trying to fix. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1608.3s)]
*  He's trying to deal with this issue. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1610.82s)]
*  He has made, when you think about immigration reform, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1613.14s)]
*  a priority by putting forward a piece of legislation [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1615.74s)]
*  on the first day of his administration. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1619.42s)]
*  And what he's going to continue to call on is for Congress, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1622.06s)]
*  Republicans to actually take action and really deal with this issue. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1625.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1631.3s)]
*  Corrine, a couple of questions. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1632.18s)]
*  One, is there a log showing how many times [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1633.8600000000001s)]
*  the president has been to that office [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1639.22s)]
*  during, you know, when he was vice president, et cetera? [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1643.42s)]
*  Is there a log showing the times that he traveled there? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1647.82s)]
*  Traveled where? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1651.6200000000001s)]
*  To the office, to that office. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1652.9s)]
*  To the — [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1654.3s)]
*  Yes, the Biden Pins, yes. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1655.82s)]
*  You mean since he's been vice president? [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1657.06s)]
*  No. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1658.5s)]
*  Oh, since he left as vice president? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1658.98s)]
*  I do not know of such a log. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1661.3s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1665.78s)]
*  Look, I'm not sure. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1667.1s)]
*  You're just trying to see how many times he's gone to the Penn-Biden Center office. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1669.14s)]
*  I don't have anything to share about how — [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1675.14s)]
*  He's — I mean, at least for the last two years, right, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1677.58s)]
*  you guys have been very aware of where he goes, right, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1680.14s)]
*  because he has a protective pool that travels with him at all times. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1682.98s)]
*  So I can only speak to the last two years [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1687.46s)]
*  when he was a citizen, right, after becoming vice president. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1689.98s)]
*  I cannot speak to his movements there, [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1694.02s)]
*  where he's been or how many times he was there. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1697.42s)]
*  As you know, he worked at University of Pennsylvania, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1699.8200000000002s)]
*  so clearly he was there often. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1703.1000000000001s)]
*  But as president, you guys are very much aware of his movements [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1705.06s)]
*  and where he goes and the trips that he takes, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1708.5s)]
*  because he is indeed president of the United States. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1711.5s)]
*  So I can't speak to — speak to after that or before that. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1713.5800000000002s)]
*  You spoke with the legal aspect of it. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1717.22s)]
*  There is also a political aspect to this as well. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1719.18s)]
*  There are some Republicans who are grabbing onto this cloud [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1722.6200000000001s)]
*  of documents that have been reported. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1727.26s)]
*  What do you believe will happen? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1729.98s)]
*  How will the work for the American public [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1731.8200000000002s)]
*  go forth with Republicans already talking about investigations? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1734.7800000000002s)]
*  Already, Marjorie Taylor has been screaming impeachment for the longest. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1738.6200000000001s)]
*  And now with this, she's saying impeachment. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1742.3000000000002s)]
*  How does the work of the American public move forward [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1744.5400000000002s)]
*  as now documents are reported that were in an office connected to Joe Biden? [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1747.26s)]
*  Again, I'm going to sound like a broken record, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1754.7s)]
*  but the more prudent thing to do is to make sure [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1757.94s)]
*  that my colleagues are dealing with this, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1762.18s)]
*  my colleagues in the White House counsel office. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1766.86s)]
*  And I want to respect the process. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1770.54s)]
*  This is an ongoing process, as you all know, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1772.02s)]
*  that is being reviewed by the Department of Justice. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1774.18s)]
*  And I'm just not going to speak beyond that. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1776.74s)]
*  I'm talking about the politics. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1778.58s)]
*  I know you're talking about the politics. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1779.66s)]
*  Not just the legal, but I'm talking about the politics. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1780.58s)]
*  I understand. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1782.46s)]
*  I'm just not going. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1783.22s)]
*  There is an ongoing process that is being reviewed by the Department of Justice. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1784.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm just not going to speak beyond that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1788.26s)]
*  Lastly, the Atlanta trip. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1789.5s)]
*  Can you talk about what this moment, [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1790.7s)]
*  with this year being the 60th anniversary of the march on Washington, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1794.1s)]
*  what does this King holiday mean to this president? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1798.58s)]
*  This holiday, as every holiday, when we talk about the legacy of Dr. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1802.8200000000002s)]
*  Martin Luther King, when we remember him on his birthday, [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1807.5800000000002s)]
*  has always been a critical moment for this president. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1810.5800000000002s)]
*  You heard him talk about the reasons why he decided to run. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1813.38s)]
*  A lot of it had to do with civil rights. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1817.74s)]
*  And and he has an administration that makes sure that no one is forgotten, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1820.1000000000001s)]
*  that there is a that he has an administration that represents the country. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1824.66s)]
*  One of the most the most diverse administration in modern history. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1828.8999999999999s)]
*  And that also shows a commitment to how he he believes to to Dr. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1833.2199999999998s)]
*  Martin Luther King Jr.'s legacy as well and making sure that we walk in that legacy every day. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1839.74s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1845.78s)]
*  He's going to be speaking, as you know, at Ebenezer Church in a couple of days. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1846.78s)]
*  And he wanted to make sure that he recognized that day by going there [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1850.74s)]
*  and and talking about the legacy of Dr. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1856.42s)]
*  Martin Luther King, what he meant not just to the black community, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1859.5800000000002s)]
*  but to every community just across the country to Americans. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1862.5800000000002s)]
*  Great. Thank you so much. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1866.74s)]
*  President Biden campaigned on a promise to stay true to the spirit of transparency. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1868.6200000000001s)]
*  Why then? How is it possible that the White House did not reveal the presence [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1876.6200000000001s)]
*  of these documents prior to the election when they were found? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1880.94s)]
*  Again, the president spoke to this personally yesterday. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1884.5s)]
*  You heard him at the press conference. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1887.3s)]
*  He laid out he laid out what he knew and he talked about how important [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1888.9399999999998s)]
*  and how he sees this as a serious matter when it comes to classified documents [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1894.86s)]
*  and information. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1900.02s)]
*  He talked about when about how he was surprised to learn [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1901.1s)]
*  about the records that had been found there. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1904.6599999999999s)]
*  And he laid out his process and his thoughts. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1907.98s)]
*  I'm just not going to go beyond that. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1911.26s)]
*  Again, we released information that was very transparent, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1913.18s)]
*  meaning the information that you all get received from the White House [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1916.5800000000002s)]
*  Council's office. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1919.5800000000002s)]
*  And it just I know I just I know you all are going to have a lot of questions. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1920.7s)]
*  I get that and I understand that, but I'm not going to go beyond the process. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1926.46s)]
*  That's currently happening at the DOJ. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1930.66s)]
*  Does it undercut the president's promise of transparency [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1932.18s)]
*  that these documents were not revealed for several months [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1936.22s)]
*  after the White House discovered them? [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1939.0200000000002s)]
*  But look, you know, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1940.78s)]
*  so when his lawyers realized that these documents were there, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1943.42s)]
*  they turned them over to the archives. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1947.74s)]
*  They did the right thing. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1949.8600000000001s)]
*  They turned them. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1951.26s)]
*  All I can say is what the president said yesterday. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1953.66s)]
*  I would refer to his comments, but they did the right thing by once they learned [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1956.1000000000001s)]
*  of them, they turned it over. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1960.3s)]
*  They turned it over to the archives. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1962.06s)]
*  And this is the question. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1965.38s)]
*  I understand the question, but there is an ongoing process. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1966.66s)]
*  It's being reviewed by the Department of Justice. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1969.14s)]
*  Just when it is appropriate for us to say more, we will. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1971.38s)]
*  Otherwise, I would refer you to the White House Council's office. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1974.94s)]
*  Do you want to be very clear about something you said? [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1977.5s)]
*  Make sure you're following up on one of my colleagues who asked you. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1979.66s)]
*  You have not spoken to the president about this. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1983.8600000000001s)]
*  You were you traveling with him. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1986.26s)]
*  Well, no, I know the way I heard the question is, have you talked [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1987.8600000000001s)]
*  to the president about the documents? [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1991.26s)]
*  And he doesn't know what's in the documents. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1992.66s)]
*  That's the way I heard the question. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1995.42s)]
*  So that's the way I was answering the question. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1996.7800000000002s)]
*  You talked to him about the revelation of these documents. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=1998.5s)]
*  Yes, we talked about the CBS story. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2000.58s)]
*  We talked about the revelation of the documents, obviously, [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2002.58s)]
*  but about the documents itself, what's in them. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2005.82s)]
*  That is something that the president doesn't even know. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2008.58s)]
*  And I'm just going to leave it there. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2010.62s)]
*  OK, has he conveyed to you when he was briefed? [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2011.74s)]
*  And if not, can you go back and get that answer? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2014.42s)]
*  I have not talked to the president about that. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2016.78s)]
*  What I can tell you is I know you all have a lot of questions. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2019.66s)]
*  There is an ongoing process here. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2022.02s)]
*  And so I'm just going to let the process finish before. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2024.38s)]
*  I want to let you respond to former Vice President Mike Pence, [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2027.54s)]
*  who talked about what he and his mother Republicans [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2031.7s)]
*  are calling a double standard with the Department of Justice. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2033.82s)]
*  Mr. Pence said, the kind of double standard [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2036.82s)]
*  that we see being practiced by the Biden administration [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2038.6599999999999s)]
*  in the wake of this incident in the Justice Department, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2040.98s)]
*  I think is exactly what undermines public confidence [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2043.58s)]
*  in our justice system. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2046.78s)]
*  Again, as soon as his lawyers realized [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2048.62s)]
*  these documents were there, they did the right thing, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2051.7s)]
*  and they turned over the documents to their archivists. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2055.3s)]
*  That's what they did as soon as they realized [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2057.98s)]
*  what the documents were there. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2061.1800000000003s)]
*  And his team is cooperating fully with the review. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2063.9s)]
*  Again, there's a review happening by the DOJ. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2068.5s)]
*  And we're just going to let the process move forward. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2071.54s)]
*  We'll let the group go. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2074.1400000000003s)]
*  Great. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2075.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm going to go around. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2075.6400000000003s)]
*  I'll come back. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2076.54s)]
*  I'll come back. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2077.0600000000004s)]
*  Thanks, Karine. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2077.82s)]
*  Just to follow up on Franco's question, [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2078.6200000000003s)]
*  given the position you're holding right now, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2080.94s)]
*  there are no assurances you can provide at this point [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2083.94s)]
*  that there are no other classified documents out there [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2086.26s)]
*  in any other office in our home? [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2088.82s)]
*  Again, this is an ongoing process. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2090.46s)]
*  So I'm going to let the process continue. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2092.82s)]
*  It is being reviewed by the Department of Justice, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2094.98s)]
*  and I'm just going to leave it there. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2097.2200000000003s)]
*  You referenced the council's statement [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2099.06s)]
*  that there are limitations to what you all can say [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2100.52s)]
*  at this point in time. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2102.52s)]
*  Do those limitations, just for clarity's sake, [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2103.34s)]
*  extend to literally everything beyond what [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2105.26s)]
*  the special counsel said on Monday night [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2107.62s)]
*  and what the president said last night? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2109.3s)]
*  There's the White House counsel. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2111.62s)]
*  My colleagues are here to answer questions [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2112.86s)]
*  on this particular issue, and I am just [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2115.1400000000003s)]
*  going to let them speak to this. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2118.1400000000003s)]
*  They put out on Monday a very informative, transparent [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2119.82s)]
*  statement about this particular issue. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2125.94s)]
*  So I'm going to let them speak to this any further. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2128.58s)]
*  But as for me, as for here, I'm just not going to go [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2131.34s)]
*  beyond what's happening currently. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2134.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2136.02s)]
*  And just one last one. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2136.52s)]
*  The president alluded to last night, you kind of had as well, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2137.5s)]
*  the idea of once this is kind of all over or wrapped up, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2139.98s)]
*  there will be more information. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2143.34s)]
*  There will be more details. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2144.64s)]
*  Do you have a plan for that? [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2145.98s)]
*  How should we expect that additional information [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2147.94s)]
*  to come in terms of detail? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2150.3s)]
*  Everything you know, once this is done, how does that all work? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2152.54s)]
*  So as the president told all of you yesterday, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2155.54s)]
*  we are committed to doing the right thing here, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2159.22s)]
*  and we'll provide further details at appropriate time. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2161.06s)]
*  And that's all I can share at this time. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2164.44s)]
*  Afghanistan, please. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2166.7s)]
*  Thanks, Green. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2168.46s)]
*  The US Travel Association says today's FAA catastrophic system [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2168.94s)]
*  failure is a clear sign that America's transportation network [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2172.38s)]
*  desperately needs significant upgrades. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2175.1s)]
*  So what specific steps are underway to ensure [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2177.34s)]
*  that outages like this won't happen again? [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2179.5s)]
*  So the NoTAM system is continuously being updated. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2181.7000000000003s)]
*  That is something that is happening on a regular basis. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2186.3s)]
*  As Secretary Buttigieg said today, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2189.3s)]
*  DOT is asking the FAA how we improve the system to ensure [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2191.46s)]
*  it is a state of the art. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2195.98s)]
*  Every five years, there is a review of the FAA authorization, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2198.46s)]
*  and that is coming up this year. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2201.5s)]
*  So we welcome the attention from Congress [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2203.2200000000003s)]
*  to ensure the FAA has what it needs to address these issues. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2205.6200000000003s)]
*  The FAA is working aggressively to get [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2209.1400000000003s)]
*  to the bottom of the root causes of what happened with the system [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2211.7400000000002s)]
*  outage today and making sure, again, making sure [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2214.82s)]
*  that it doesn't happen again. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2218.1000000000004s)]
*  Clearly, the safety of Americans who are flying every day [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2220.26s)]
*  is a number one priority. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2223.54s)]
*  And what they're going to do is to make sure [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2225.5s)]
*  that this doesn't happen again. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2227.26s)]
*  How concerning is it for the White House [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2228.5400000000004s)]
*  that there's no backup, no contingency to the system [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2230.34s)]
*  when it does fail? [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2232.6600000000003s)]
*  Look, what you saw happen today was out of abundance of caution, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2234.1400000000003s)]
*  the action that was taken, because, again, [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2238.34s)]
*  the safety of Americans is a priority. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2241.7000000000003s)]
*  They're going to get to the bottom of this. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2244.38s)]
*  There's going to be an after action document that's [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2246.1800000000003s)]
*  going to be put together. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2249.78s)]
*  And so we will make sure that what the president wants to see [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2251.0600000000004s)]
*  is to make sure that this doesn't occur again. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2254.1800000000003s)]
*  Could you tap into funds from the bipartisan infrastructure [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2256.54s)]
*  law, for example, to try to make some of those upgrades [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2259.42s)]
*  that you're talking about? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2262.1s)]
*  We'll see what the after action report shows. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2263.9s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of that as far as any funding [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2266.58s)]
*  and what needs to happen next. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2268.94s)]
*  Thank you, Corrine. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2271.82s)]
*  Does President Biden have confidence in Transportation [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2273.14s)]
*  Secretary Buttigieg? [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2276.2599999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2277.42s)]
*  Why? [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2278.14s)]
*  Because Secretary Buttigieg, he respects the secretary [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2279.34s)]
*  and the work that he has been doing. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2284.66s)]
*  You have seen the secretary on TV. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2286.74s)]
*  You have probably spoken to him yourself. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2289.3799999999997s)]
*  And they are doing everything that they [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2292.06s)]
*  can to make sure that the experience that Americans have [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2293.74s)]
*  is a good one. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2298.94s)]
*  That's why they've held the airlines accountable. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2299.66s)]
*  You've seen the secretary do that over and over again. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2302.8599999999997s)]
*  And we understand what Americans have been going through [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2306.18s)]
*  these past couple of months. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2309.18s)]
*  That's why the secretary has been very clear [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2310.42s)]
*  on making sure that they are held accountable, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2313.86s)]
*  has put in processes in place to make sure that that occurs. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2316.1400000000003s)]
*  And yes, the president has confidence in Secretary [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2320.58s)]
*  Buttigieg. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2323.06s)]
*  And then on these documents, how could anyone [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2323.56s)]
*  be that irresponsible? [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2326.38s)]
*  Isn't that what this president says about mishandling [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2331.34s)]
*  classified documents? [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2333.6200000000003s)]
*  The president spoke to this personally. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2334.6600000000003s)]
*  He spoke to this personally. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2336.38s)]
*  Again, he believes that classified documents [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2338.2200000000003s)]
*  and information should be taken seriously. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2341.78s)]
*  He takes them seriously. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2343.74s)]
*  And he was surprised to learn by any records. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2345.3799999999997s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2349.06s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2349.8199999999997s)]
*  Here's what happened. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2350.4199999999996s)]
*  Here's what happened once in his work. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2351.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, let me explain to you the process. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2354.02s)]
*  Here's what happened when his lawyers found out [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2356.8199999999997s)]
*  that the documents were there. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2359.3399999999997s)]
*  They immediately turned them over to the archives. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2360.58s)]
*  But they immediately turned them over to the archives. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2364.18s)]
*  I'm not going to go into specifics. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2367.5s)]
*  But what I'm reiterating to you is [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2369.9399999999996s)]
*  what you heard from the president yourself, Peter, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2372.44s)]
*  which is how he saw the process and how he respects [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2375.4s)]
*  and truly respects and takes this very seriously. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2379.08s)]
*  And when he knew and how surprised he was by it [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2383.7200000000003s)]
*  and the actions that the right actions that the lawyers took. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2387.2400000000002s)]
*  Again, this is under review by the Department of Justice. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2391.64s)]
*  And we're going to let that process continue. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2396.56s)]
*  How can President Biden be trusted moving forward [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2398.44s)]
*  with America's secrets? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2401.32s)]
*  Because his lawyers, his team did the right thing. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2402.48s)]
*  But he had a closet with classified information [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2405.28s)]
*  and it did the right thing. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2408.44s)]
*  Again, again, again, he was surprised [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2410.04s)]
*  that the records were there. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2413.84s)]
*  He spoke to this personally. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2415.52s)]
*  He was surprised that the records were there. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2417.7200000000003s)]
*  And when his lawyers found out and his team found out [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2420.96s)]
*  that they were there, they turned it over to the archives. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2423.88s)]
*  And now it's being reviewed by the Department of Justice. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2427.4s)]
*  And just one more. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2430.2000000000003s)]
*  Why didn't President Biden want to see what's really [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2431.2s)]
*  going on at the border? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2433.12s)]
*  He did see exactly what's going on at the border. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2434.8799999999997s)]
*  He didn't talk to any migrants and he didn't go anywhere [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2437.16s)]
*  that people actually cross illegally. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2439.56s)]
*  Why not? [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2441.2799999999997s)]
*  But he met, he went to the Migrant Center, [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2442.3999999999996s)]
*  which was a critical place to be. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2445.16s)]
*  When you think about the partners who are our partners [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2447.68s)]
*  who are helping support the migrants on the ground there, [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2451.16s)]
*  there happened to be no migrants at the facility [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2455.56s)]
*  at the time that he visited. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2457.56s)]
*  But let's, but let's. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2459.2s)]
*  Because El Paso has been crushed. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2460.2s)]
*  The shelters are full. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2461.64s)]
*  There are overflow migrants sleeping in the streets. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2463.0s)]
*  And then it's just a coincidence that suddenly the president [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2465.24s)]
*  shows up and there's no. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2467.16s)]
*  Well, let me talk about what's going on in El Paso, right? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2468.4399999999996s)]
*  El Paso did go down significantly [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2471.0s)]
*  prior to the president's visit by about 70%. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2473.3999999999996s)]
*  And that's a good thing, Peter. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2477.48s)]
*  That's a good thing that we've seen the numbers go down. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2479.16s)]
*  And that is something that we should be saying, OK, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2482.16s)]
*  that's a good job there. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2485.96s)]
*  It has helped ease pressure all across the community. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2487.84s)]
*  But the president visit had nothing to do with it. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2490.52s)]
*  And so look, again, we went, he went to a migrant center. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2494.6400000000003s)]
*  He went to one of the busiest port of entry, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2499.32s)]
*  which is in El Paso. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2501.6000000000004s)]
*  And so the president got to see. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2503.6800000000003s)]
*  He went to the border. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2506.32s)]
*  He got to see for himself talking to, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2507.28s)]
*  we've always been very clear that we were going to, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2509.2400000000002s)]
*  he was going to talk to the people on the ground who [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2511.36s)]
*  was working on the border. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2514.92s)]
*  And that's what you saw. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2516.56s)]
*  You saw him meet with the CBP. [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2517.56s)]
*  You saw him meet with partners on the ground, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2520.2s)]
*  as I just stated, who deal with migrants and their families. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2522.24s)]
*  And the president also is going to continue [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2525.7999999999997s)]
*  to call on Congress to take action. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2527.68s)]
*  The president has been doing the work. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2530.64s)]
*  And if you think about the record funding, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2532.6s)]
*  he has done more than any prior president [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2535.88s)]
*  to secure the border and build a safe, orderly, and humane [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2538.84s)]
*  immigration system. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2542.4s)]
*  And that's what the president has been able to do. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2543.68s)]
*  We've got 23,000 agents working to secure the border [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2545.84s)]
*  and will soon be hiring 300 more. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2549.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what the president has done here. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2551.76s)]
*  And so again, he went down there. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2555.1200000000003s)]
*  He saw for himself. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2557.0s)]
*  And I'll just leave it there. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2559.04s)]
*  I have a follow up. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2560.6000000000004s)]
*  Corrine. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2562.08s)]
*  Corrine. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2562.58s)]
*  Corrine. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2563.08s)]
*  Corrine. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2563.58s)]
*  I'm on left. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2564.08s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2565.56s)]
*  Why don't you follow up on that? [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2566.06s)]
*  No, go ahead. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2567.44s)]
*  This lady in the front. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2567.94s)]
*  Was there any discussion of President Biden [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2570.2000000000003s)]
*  getting a physical while he was at Walter Reed this morning? [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2572.28s)]
*  Or could you provide any update on when that might happen next? [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2574.84s)]
*  Again, this is about his wife today. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2577.36s)]
*  He wanted to be there to support her. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2581.04s)]
*  I don't have anything else to share besides the fact [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2584.32s)]
*  that they've been married for 45 years. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2586.84s)]
*  And he wanted to be there with Dr. Biden during this time. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2589.84s)]
*  And then I just have one quick question on Brazil. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2593.8s)]
*  Has there been any discussion in the administration [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2595.7200000000003s)]
*  about if there were to be an extradition request from Brazil [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2598.6800000000003s)]
*  for Bolsonaro for the events that happened this week? [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2602.12s)]
*  So I don't have an update for you on this. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2604.92s)]
*  I'm not aware of an official request for information [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2607.0s)]
*  of or extradition from the Brazilian government. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2609.96s)]
*  Though, of course, if we were to receive one, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2614.08s)]
*  we treat it seriously and examine it carefully, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2616.3199999999997s)]
*  as we generally do for such requests. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2619.04s)]
*  Just not aware of one at this time. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2621.2s)]
*  Good. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2623.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2624.2s)]
*  A follow up on the gas stoves and just a quick one [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2624.72s)]
*  on the president's op-ed today on social media. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2626.88s)]
*  On the gas stoves question, Senate Democrats [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2629.3199999999997s)]
*  are calling for more regulations on gas stoves [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2631.28s)]
*  because they contribute to indoor air pollution. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2633.6000000000004s)]
*  Is the president worried about the climate [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2636.6800000000003s)]
*  impact of a gas stove? [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2638.6400000000003s)]
*  So look, again, when it comes to the question about safety [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2641.0s)]
*  or the effect of gas stove, that is not [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2645.5600000000004s)]
*  something that we can speak to here at the White House. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2648.98s)]
*  So I would refer you to the Consumer Product Safety [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2651.92s)]
*  Commission. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2654.2000000000003s)]
*  And the president does not support banning gas stoves [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2655.6400000000003s)]
*  and the Consumer Product Safety Commission, [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2659.2000000000003s)]
*  which is independent, is not banning gas stoves. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2660.92s)]
*  So I just want to be very clear on that. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2663.6s)]
*  And so again, that's not something [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2666.2400000000002s)]
*  that we can make from here about the safety of a gas stove. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2668.2000000000003s)]
*  That's not something that the White House can provide. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2671.16s)]
*  On the president's op-ed in the Wall Street Journal [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2673.44s)]
*  about social media, he talked about reforming Section 230. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2675.48s)]
*  But the bottom line, does the president [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2678.6s)]
*  think that social media companies [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2680.84s)]
*  should be legally responsible for what [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2682.52s)]
*  goes on on their platforms? [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2684.8s)]
*  So look, holding big technology, big tech accountable [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2686.88s)]
*  has been a priority for this president [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2691.08s)]
*  since the day he took office. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2692.6s)]
*  In July of 2021, his competition executive order explicitly [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2694.88s)]
*  called for enforcing antitrust laws [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2699.0s)]
*  to meet the challenges posed by new industries and technologies, [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2701.4s)]
*  including the rise of the dominant internet platforms [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2704.96s)]
*  and addressing the surveillance of users. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2708.08s)]
*  It is also part of his unity agenda, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2710.28s)]
*  as you heard him say last year, talk about his unity agenda. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2712.0s)]
*  And you may recall in that unity agenda, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2715.8s)]
*  he talked about the four areas that have traditionally [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2719.2000000000003s)]
*  been bipartisan and where the president believes [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2721.5600000000004s)]
*  we can make bipartisan progress. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2724.2000000000003s)]
*  And in his op-ed, he urges Democrats and Republicans [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2726.1600000000003s)]
*  in Congress to pass a bipartisan legislation. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2729.92s)]
*  Look, the president, again, outlined the same policy [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2732.8s)]
*  positions in this op-ed today that you saw, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2736.0200000000004s)]
*  you heard from him in the State of the Union last year. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2738.84s)]
*  He said it's time to strengthen privacy protections, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2741.28s)]
*  ban targeted advertising to children, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2743.92s)]
*  demand tech companies stop collecting personal data [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2746.14s)]
*  on our children. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2749.0s)]
*  And also, you may remember that one of the president's guests, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2750.36s)]
*  the first lady's guest at the State of the Union [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2755.56s)]
*  was Francis Haugen, the Facebook whistleblower. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2757.48s)]
*  So this is an issue that the president's [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2762.7200000000003s)]
*  going to continue to focus on and is incredibly [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2764.96s)]
*  important to him. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2768.52s)]
*  And so as the new Congress starts, [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2769.4s)]
*  he's going to continue to reiterate a bipartisanship [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2771.88s)]
*  there. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2774.56s)]
*  When it comes to liability, does he [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2775.06s)]
*  think that social media companies need [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2776.6s)]
*  to have some skin in the game where they could be sued [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2778.28s)]
*  over what happens on their platforms? [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2781.2000000000003s)]
*  When it comes to sectional reforming of Section 230, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2783.2000000000003s)]
*  he continues to call for that, increasing competition, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2786.32s)]
*  reducing the impact of tech companies over our lives, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2790.0s)]
*  extends back to the campaign. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2794.12s)]
*  And he has reiterated them as president. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2796.2000000000003s)]
*  So he's going to continue to do that. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2798.84s)]
*  He's going to continue to call for a bipartisan legislation [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2800.36s)]
*  as we've seen the new Congress. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2803.2000000000003s)]
*  And that's what you're going to hear from the president. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2805.0s)]
*  And also, that's why he wanted to lay out his thoughts [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2807.32s)]
*  with the new Congress in the op-ed. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2810.88s)]
*  Thank you, Corinne. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2813.2400000000002s)]
*  Can I get your reaction on the new House [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2814.2400000000002s)]
*  Select Committee on China? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2816.1600000000003s)]
*  Does the administration plan to work with them? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2818.08s)]
*  Do you believe they will be helpful in achieving [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2820.44s)]
*  your goals in strategic competition with Beijing? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2822.84s)]
*  And are you concerned about the potential for anti-Asian hate? [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2825.6800000000003s)]
*  Under President Biden, we are more prepared [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2830.7200000000003s)]
*  to outcompete China, protect our national security, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2833.08s)]
*  and advance a free and open Indo-Pacific than ever before. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2836.92s)]
*  Many of our efforts we have been pursuing [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2841.0s)]
*  are bipartisan, underscoring the alignment at home [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2842.92s)]
*  on the key issue. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2846.28s)]
*  We look forward to the committee getting stood up. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2847.36s)]
*  And we'll continue to work with Democrats and Republicans [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2850.2s)]
*  in Congress on this issue. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2852.52s)]
*  It is a top priority as we talk about outcompeting China. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2855.64s)]
*  And do you believe, just on the last part, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2859.8799999999997s)]
*  do you, are you concerned about the potential [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2861.8799999999997s)]
*  of the committee perpetuating any kind of anti-Asian hate? [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2864.56s)]
*  Look, that is something that we're going to, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2867.44s)]
*  we will always call out against. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2868.8399999999997s)]
*  That's something that you've heard from the president [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2870.92s)]
*  and you've heard from this administration, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2872.6s)]
*  calling out any anti-Asian hate. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2874.52s)]
*  That is not who we should be or who we are. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2876.92s)]
*  And so, again, that is a commitment [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2880.04s)]
*  that he has to the Asian community. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2882.44s)]
*  One more on Japan, please. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2884.72s)]
*  Ahead of the prime minister's visit, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2886.08s)]
*  can you share the goals of this visit, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2888.48s)]
*  particularly in terms of, you know, [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2890.2799999999997s)]
*  in the context of countering China [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2892.2799999999997s)]
*  and holding Russia accountable on its invasion of Ukraine? [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2894.72s)]
*  If you can be specific about what this visit [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2897.2s)]
*  particularly means in the U.S.-Japan strategic relations. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2900.48s)]
*  So, let me just more broadly, the two leaders [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2903.96s)]
*  are going to have an extensive and in-depth conversation [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2907.24s)]
*  over the last year at the East Asia Summit in Cambodia. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2910.44s)]
*  So, they're going to continue that conversation, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2915.76s)]
*  continue that relationship, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2917.36s)]
*  and the bilateral visit and Quad Summit in Tokyo as well. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2918.88s)]
*  So, they have had many extensive conversation. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2921.8s)]
*  The prime minister will arrive at the White House [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2926.04s)]
*  after consulting closely with us and regional partners [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2927.92s)]
*  on the release of Japan's new national security strategy [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2931.1600000000003s)]
*  and commitment to boosting its defense, [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2934.12s)]

*  What is the White House's response [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2997.28s)]
*  to this racial disparities, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=2998.92s)]

*  So, the TSA continuously evaluates [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3005.7200000000003s)]
*  and improves upon technology and process [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3008.88s)]

*  That is clearly a priority. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3019.8s)]
*  DHS is working with NIST to assess the performance [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3022.0400000000004s)]

*  And so, that's what they're going to continue to do, [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3034.04s)]

*  Can I just ask if you have any information [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3044.9199999999996s)]
*  about why the President's personal eternities [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3047.48s)]
*  were at the Penn-Biden Center in the first place? [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3050.56s)]
*  Were they looking for something specific? [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3052.52s)]
*  Was there something specific they were doing [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3054.16s)]
*  going through these documents? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3056.24s)]
*  It just seems like to send, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3057.74s)]
*  if it was just routine moving stuff [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3059.3199999999997s)]
*  to send a personal attorney to do it. [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3061.3999999999996s)]
*  I would refer you to the White House Council's [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3062.7599999999998s)]
*  very extensive kind of information [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3065.72s)]
*  on Monday that they provided. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3069.8399999999997s)]
*  So, I refer you to that. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3072.04s)]
*  Great. Thanks so much. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3073.64s)]
*  On the agron stop this morning, [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3076.9199999999996s)]
*  it's just such an unusual procedure. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3079.08s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can go through in any more detail [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3080.9199999999996s)]
*  when the President was told that this might happen. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3084.36s)]
*  And, you know, was he involved in that decision [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3087.28s)]
*  or that conversation before it was issued? [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3090.8s)]
*  Or did he learn afterwards? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3092.56s)]
*  If you just provide a little more detail [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3093.84s)]
*  about how that process went. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3095.32s)]
*  So, when it comes to the ground stop, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3096.6800000000003s)]
*  that's something that the FAA, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3097.88s)]
*  a decision that they made, an order that they made. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3099.7200000000003s)]
*  So, I'll send you to them. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3103.84s)]
*  As far as the President, FAA worked on this issue, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3106.88s)]
*  as I mentioned, as you've heard from Secretary Peat, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3109.08s)]
*  throughout the night and briefed Secretary Buttigieg [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3111.88s)]
*  and briefed Secretary Buttigieg early this morning. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3114.6400000000003s)]
*  And then, in turn, the Secretary then briefed the President [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3117.2400000000002s)]
*  and he spoke to you all directly shortly after. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3120.7200000000003s)]
*  And so, that has been the process [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3124.1600000000003s)]
*  on how the President was briefed. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3125.48s)]
*  Did the President know before this ground stop [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3127.76s)]
*  or he was told immediately afterward? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3129.8s)]
*  He was told before. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3132.56s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3134.1600000000003s)]
*  And then, I'm sort of looking back to the summit. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3135.2400000000002s)]
*  There were not major announcements [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3138.88s)]
*  on the border or fentanyl. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3141.36s)]
*  And I'm wondering what we should take that to mean [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3143.2400000000002s)]
*  in terms of the success of the summit. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3146.08s)]
*  So, as it relates to migration, irregular migration, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3148.6400000000003s)]
*  obviously, that was a key topic of discussion. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3153.08s)]
*  As all of you know, President Biden discussed ways [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3155.2400000000002s)]
*  our countries can continue to work, work together, [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3157.76s)]
*  and to address irregular migration. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3160.48s)]
*  So, that conversation certainly happened extensively. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3162.0s)]
*  He discussed the recent announcement [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3164.88s)]
*  of additional enforcement actions [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3166.4s)]
*  coupled with expanded pathways for Cubans, Haitians, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3167.8s)]
*  Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3171.64s)]
*  And the leaders were able to agree [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3173.52s)]
*  on a number of initiatives, including a virtual platform [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3175.52s)]
*  through the Los Angeles Declaration website, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3178.4s)]
*  which will provide migrants when one unified location [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3180.8s)]
*  in which to access legal pathways they may be eligible for, [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3184.8s)]
*  as well as establishing physical centers [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3188.08s)]
*  where migrants can come in, in person, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3190.88s)]
*  access those legal pathways as well. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3193.68s)]
*  And so, again, it was an extensive conversation [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3196.64s)]
*  on irregular migration. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3199.68s)]
*  When it comes to fentanyl, we've been [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3200.7999999999997s)]
*  focused on taking big actions to fight drug traffickers [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3202.7599999999998s)]
*  and go after financiers of cartels attempting [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3206.64s)]
*  to bring fentanyl into our country. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3209.64s)]
*  And so, during his meeting with President Auberdure, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3212.3199999999997s)]
*  the president discussed increased cooperation [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3215.68s)]
*  to prosecute drug traffickers and dismantle criminal networks, [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3218.12s)]
*  disrupt the supply of illicit precursors chemicals used [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3221.56s)]
*  to make fentanyl, as well shut down drug laboratories, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3225.32s)]
*  and prevent trafficking of drug arms and people [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3228.36s)]
*  across our shared border. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3230.68s)]
*  So there was a commitment and coordination [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3232.16s)]
*  and on law enforcement training, the best practices [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3235.16s)]
*  so we can better go after criminal networks [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3237.52s)]
*  in the fentanyl trade. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3239.72s)]
*  Again, this was a meeting, a summit [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3241.24s)]
*  that happened to our closest neighbors [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3244.68s)]
*  on how we can move forward in dealing [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3247.0s)]
*  with some of the issues that are really important to the three [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3249.44s)]
*  leaders. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3253.92s)]
*  As ambitious as you had hoped, I mean, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3255.16s)]
*  was the White House a little let down [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3257.84s)]
*  by the scope of the agreements? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3261.44s)]
*  And can you characterize how you're feeling at this moment [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3263.68s)]
*  about the outcome? [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3267.4s)]
*  So we believe we announced a robust set of initiatives [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3270.48s)]
*  on issues that are critical to North America. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3274.52s)]
*  That's what you saw from the three leaders. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3276.48s)]
*  We saw them yesterday in Mexico City answer questions, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3278.2s)]
*  speak to the different issues that matter to their country. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3280.8799999999997s)]
*  And look, just a couple of things [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3287.24s)]
*  that includes expanding and deepening our security [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3288.68s)]
*  cooperation to combat drug trafficking, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3290.7599999999998s)]
*  as I just laid out, redoubling efforts [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3292.64s)]
*  to address climate change by taking efforts [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3295.16s)]
*  to reduce methane emissions and decarbonize [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3297.72s)]
*  public transportation, strengthening and expanding [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3300.96s)]
*  North American supply chains for semiconductors [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3303.3199999999997s)]
*  and critical minerals, and providing alternatives [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3306.16s)]
*  to irregular migration by increasing ways [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3308.3599999999997s)]
*  migrants can access legal pathways to North America. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3310.64s)]
*  Again, we believe those were a robust set of initiatives, [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3313.52s)]
*  continuing their close friendships [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3316.7599999999998s)]
*  as we move forward to what's important and critical [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3319.48s)]
*  to North America. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3323.8799999999997s)]
*  And then on the border, we were wondering, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3324.72s)]
*  there were Republican members of Congress with the president. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3327.52s)]
*  Were they invited to come with him? [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3330.68s)]
*  Can you talk through that? [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3333.44s)]
*  Yeah, so I was asked about this a couple of days ago. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3334.88s)]
*  Look, we go through the normal process [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3338.36s)]
*  as we go into a state, whether it's [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3340.52s)]
*  Republican or Democrats in that state, [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3344.2000000000003s)]
*  and just don't have anything further. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3347.44s)]
*  Our Office of Legislative Affairs [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3349.28s)]
*  certainly reach out to congressional members. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3350.92s)]
*  Intergovernmental Affairs certainly [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3353.76s)]
*  reach out to state and local officials. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3355.6400000000003s)]
*  As you saw, Governor Abbott met the president [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3359.12s)]
*  when he arrived at the airport. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3363.52s)]
*  And so again, we have a regular process [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3366.04s)]
*  that we go forth with every trip, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3369.24s)]
*  and there was nothing different here. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3373.24s)]
*  So legislative affairs did reach out [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3374.74s)]
*  to Republican members in the implication [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3376.16s)]
*  that we reach out to their federal offices [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3377.7599999999998s)]
*  like we always do with every trip. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3379.6s)]
*  And then one quick question, just [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3381.36s)]
*  following up on April's really good point, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3382.56s)]
*  she, in her question, brought up the notion [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3385.0s)]
*  that President Biden was really former Vice President Joe [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3387.36s)]
*  Biden during the period in which these documents were [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3392.24s)]
*  found. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3394.3599999999997s)]
*  And can you tell us how many other offices there [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3395.24s)]
*  may have been? [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3397.68s)]
*  I realize that you can't say whether they're being searched [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3398.3999999999996s)]
*  or whether there is any sort of book for documents, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3400.9599999999996s)]
*  but how big is the scope of additional offices [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3403.08s)]
*  where, at that point, a former vice president was doing work? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3406.9199999999996s)]
*  Look, this is an ongoing process, [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3412.4399999999996s)]
*  and I'm just going to be prudent here, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3414.24s)]
*  and it would be more appropriate for my colleagues [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3416.3999999999996s)]
*  to answer, my colleagues at the White House counsel's office [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3419.24s)]
*  to address this. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3422.4399999999996s)]
*  Again, I want to respect the process, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3425.12s)]
*  and so again, I will refer you to them. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3426.8799999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3428.72s)]
*  One quick follow on that. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3429.22s)]
*  Obviously, he said he was surprised about these documents [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3432.7599999999998s)]
*  being found. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3436.6s)]
*  Has he expressed any other emotion in response to these? [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3437.4799999999996s)]
*  You heard directly from the president [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3442.9599999999996s)]
*  yesterday about this particular issue. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3445.2799999999997s)]
*  He answered it in a personal way. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3447.64s)]
*  Again, I would refer you to his response [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3450.3599999999997s)]
*  and how he saw the issue. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3452.72s)]
*  I just don't have anything else to share [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3454.7999999999997s)]
*  beyond what the president shared with you [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3456.72s)]
*  and the American people yesterday. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3458.3199999999997s)]
*  We'll see you tomorrow. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3459.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3460.56s)]
*  Thanks, Frank. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3461.16s)]
*  Thanks, Frank. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3461.68s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKpL2PWN7L8&t=3477.64s)]
