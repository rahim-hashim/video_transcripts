# Hostage families SUE Columbia protest leaders, accuse them of ‘aiding’ Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY)
*  And we have more now on Mahmoud Khalil, who is under even more legal pressure this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=0.0s)]
*  Some of the families of hostages kidnapped by Hamas during the October 7th attack are [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=4.54s)]
*  now suing the anti-Israel activists and several student groups. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=9.06s)]
*  Let's get an update from Alexis McAdams. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=13.08s)]
*  She's live at Columbia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Hi Alexis. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=16.04s)]
*  Hi Dana. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=17.04s)]
*  So we've been watching these campus protests for months and now we know people all across [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=18.04s)]
*  the country and around the world were watching them too, including the family of some of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=22.6s)]
*  those hostages who were held against their will. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=26.04s)]
*  Some of them did not make it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=28.8s)]
*  Now they're suing here, specifically suing Mahmoud Khalil and other campus protesters [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=30.14s)]
*  saying they are an arm of Hamas and are aiding and abetting that terrorist organization. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=35.24s)]
*  So the new lawsuit was just filed in New York. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=40.300000000000004s)]
*  It says the protesters on Columbia's campus are spreading hateful rhetoric saying Mahmoud [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=42.44s)]
*  Khalil and the groups that have been protesting on this Ivy League campus are all part of [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=47.24s)]
*  the Hamas propaganda arm of New York. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=51.44s)]
*  Families of some of these hostages, okay, many who were killed at the hands of Hamas, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=54.620000000000005s)]
*  we want to look at their pictures. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=58.64s)]
*  They all had stories. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=59.64s)]
*  They want their families, the families want them to be held accountable, these protesters. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=61.28s)]
*  They don't understand why this has been going on in these college campuses. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=64.76s)]
*  They want to push for punishments here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=67.84s)]
*  More protests on campus yesterday, even though that the school cracked down. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=69.92s)]
*  Students were masked up anyway, even though they're not supposed to be now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=73.68s)]
*  The Department of Education says Columbia needs to do more to get their funding back [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=76.48s)]
*  and some teachers and students are angry. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=80.2s)]
*  Will Trump and Linda McMahon get to command universities to arrest and expel students? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=83.32s)]
*  No! [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=88.32s)]
*  Free Mahmoud! [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=89.32s)]
*  I have to mention this. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=91.32s)]
*  So the crackdown on college campuses does continue as more students, Dana, are filing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=93.24s)]
*  lawsuits, including a junior here at Columbia who just filed a lawsuit. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=97.36s)]
*  She's from South Korea. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=101.8s)]
*  She's a permanent resident, but she said she's not going anywhere, even though she was just [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=102.8s)]
*  arrested at a protest. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=105.96s)]
*  Dana. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  All right, Alexis McAdams, thank you. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDomRFrSMvY&t=108.39999999999999s)]
