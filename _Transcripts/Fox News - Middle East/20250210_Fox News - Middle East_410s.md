# Can Trump bring peace to the Middle East?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0)
*  Welcome back to Sunday Night in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza is home to natural beauty and the depravity of Hamas. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  There are Palestinians living there, seemingly unwanted by neighboring Arab countries. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=7.84s)]
*  Israel has been victimized repeatedly by terrorism emanating from Gaza and therefore has a security [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=13.64s)]
*  interest in who takes over. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=20.2s)]
*  The actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave to leave, I mean, what's wrong [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=23.44s)]
*  with that? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=28.84s)]
*  To relocate and come back, it's a remarkable idea. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=29.88s)]
*  And I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued and done, because I think it will [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=32.2s)]
*  create a different future for everyone. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=38.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=40.56s)]
*  President Trump has ideas. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=42.96s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu has ideas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  The crown prince of Saudi Arabia has ideas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=46.08s)]
*  So does the King of Jordan, with whom President Trump meets tomorrow. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=48.94s)]
*  Hostilities in that region go back thousands of years. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Iran is the main source of conflict currently, and the president is unambiguous about Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=56.64s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=64.08s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=65.6s)]
*  I'm not putting restrictions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=66.6s)]
*  They cannot have one thing. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=69.16s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=71.78s)]
*  And if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, despite what I just said, I think [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=73.72s)]
*  that's going to be very unfortunate for them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=79.28s)]
*  The first Trump term saw the Abraham Accords, which were historic, something no one thought [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=83.5s)]
*  was possible. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=88.58s)]
*  Can he actually bring lasting peace to the Middle East? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=89.58s)]
*  Joining us is Nathan Sales, former acting Under Secretary, ambassador at large and a [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=94.42s)]
*  counterterrorism expert. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=99.22s)]
*  Welcome, Ambassador. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=101.26s)]
*  Who in your judgment should control Gaza in the short term and then the long term if the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=102.74000000000001s)]
*  answers are different? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=108.22s)]
*  Hey, Trey. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=110.77999999999999s)]
*  Well, the easy answer to that question is who should not control Gaza. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=111.77999999999999s)]
*  And the answer to that is Hamas. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=114.97999999999999s)]
*  Hamas control over Gaza has been a recipe for disaster, not only for the Israelis who [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=116.61999999999999s)]
*  have suffered extensive terrorism at Hamas's hands, but also for the Palestinian people [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=121.89999999999999s)]
*  themselves, because Hamas doesn't care about building roads, hospitals, providing food [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=127.41999999999999s)]
*  and other basic necessities. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=132.38s)]
*  They care about one thing, and that's killing as many Jews as possible. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  So first thing that has to happen without any qualification at all, Hamas has to be [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=137.44s)]
*  destroyed and cannot play any role in the future of governance in Gaza. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=142.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=148.48s)]
*  Here's the secretary of defense, and then I'll ask you about it on the other side. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=150.52s)]
*  Ultimately, all options are on the table, because we're not going to lay out exactly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=155.48s)]
*  what we would or would not do in this particular context. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=161.88s)]
*  This is an outside-the-box thinker who understands, Laura, the definition of insanity, which [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=164.84s)]
*  is trying to do the same thing and hoping for a different result. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=171.24s)]
*  And in Gaza, we've seen for decades, time and time again, this false belief that if [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=174.76s)]
*  we just try a different sort of Hamas, or maybe the Palestinian Authority, or maybe [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=180.68s)]
*  once they're clear and then we allow them back in and we renegotiate again, they will [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=184.98000000000002s)]
*  get some sort of a different outcome. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=188.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=190.4s)]
*  Conventional wisdom was Saudi Arabia or an Arab nation with good relations with Israel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=192.44s)]
*  But sending U.S. troops to Gaza right after they were brought home from Afghanistan, I [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=198.16s)]
*  don't know that that's going to happen. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Do you have an opinion on what in the short term should be done? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=206.76s)]
*  We agree Hamas, no role whatsoever, eradicate them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  In the short term, is that something the U.S. is really considering, going to Gaza and kind [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=214.56s)]
*  of maintaining order there? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=219.84s)]
*  Well, it's a great question, Trey. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=221.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think we need to hear more from the White House about what the president has in [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=224.0s)]
*  mind. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=227.88s)]
*  We know a couple of things. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=228.88s)]
*  One, the United States doesn't have the greatest track record when it comes to nation-building [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=229.88s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=234.72s)]
*  And it's not clear to me that we want to take on that responsibility after seeing the failure [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=235.72s)]
*  of our efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq still an open question. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=241.8s)]
*  So I think we need to be very careful about sending American forces or American construction [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=247.48s)]
*  workers into Gaza with a huge target on their back. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=252.16s)]
*  But the other thing that we also know is 50 years of crossing our fingers and hoping for [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=255.32s)]
*  the best has not produced better outcomes for the Israelis, for the Palestinians. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=261.88s)]
*  We have to consider bold new approaches, because simply hoping for the best and maybe negotiations [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=267.21999999999997s)]
*  will eventually lead to peace isn't going to cut it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=273.72s)]
*  What needs to happen is the people of Gaza, the people of the West Bank, need to be deradicalized. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=276.64s)]
*  They need to be deprogrammed from the propaganda that has caused them to hate Israel and deny [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  its right to exist. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=288.03999999999996s)]
*  You fix that, real negotiations become possible, and then peace becomes possible. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=289.38s)]
*  But simply hoping for the best, like we have for the past several decades, is not a solution. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=294.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=299.67999999999995s)]
*  Let me ask you a somewhat provocative question. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=301.34s)]
*  If Iran is indeed the major force of disruption in the region and threatening to assassinate [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=304.64s)]
*  U.S. government officials, including our president, why not pursue regime change there? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, I think what we need to do is provide maximum support to the Iranian people, who [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=317.12s)]
*  are, let's be clear, the first victims of the Iranian regime, while at the same time [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=322.71999999999997s)]
*  applying maximum pressure to that regime. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  Toppling it is going to be a question for the Iranian people themselves, but we can [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=331.0s)]
*  help. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=334.88s)]
*  We can help delegitimize the regime. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=335.88s)]
*  We can help take away its economic sources of strength that it uses to support terrorism [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=337.48s)]
*  around the world and that it uses to suppress its own people at home. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=342.64s)]
*  I don't think we're going to see American boots on the ground in Tehran. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=346.76s)]
*  I don't think it's necessary. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=350.32s)]
*  What has to happen? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=351.9s)]
*  And we heard this from the clip from the president. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=352.9s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon under any circumstances. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=355.68s)]
*  And so we need to deny the regime the resources it uses to fund terrorism and support its [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=358.58s)]
*  nuclear ambitions. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=365.58s)]
*  That means squeezing its energy exports. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=366.94s)]
*  That means sanctions, secondary sanctions on insurance companies or shipping companies [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=369.32s)]
*  that move Iranian oil. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=374.14s)]
*  We did this to great effect during the first Trump administration. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=375.64s)]
*  The Biden folks looked the other way at sanctions enforcement, but the old sheriff is back in [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=379.08s)]
*  town and it's time to go back to the playbook of what actually works. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=383.41999999999996s)]
*  Challenging but essential issues in the Middle East. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=388.9s)]
*  Ambassador Nathan Zales, thank you for your service to our country and for joining us [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=392.82s)]
*  on a Sunday night. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=397.14s)]
*  Thanks, Ray. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0UtKU9Qyy0&t=398.14s)]
