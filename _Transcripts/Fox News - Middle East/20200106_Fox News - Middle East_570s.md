# Hannity: Dems care more about bashing Trump than literally anything else
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw)
*  It's now more clear than ever. Democrats care more about bashing this president than about literally anything else. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=0.0s)]
*  For example, the strike that took out Iranian terrorist leader Soleimani, a huge success. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  The world is safer. One of the world's worst, most powerful terrorists is dead. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=13.76s)]
*  The mob and the media, Democratic Party, they just seem distraught. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=19.44s)]
*  In fact, today, Nancy Pelosi, speaker name only, announced a resolution trying to tell the commander [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=23.44s)]
*  in chief what he can and cannot do in Iran. Pelosi obviously, again, knows nothing about the U.S. Constitution, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=29.76s)]
*  separation of powers. Yes, he's the elected commander in chief, not her. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  And this totally unenforceable, non-binding resolution is nothing more than the latest political hijab [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=41.2s)]
*  to undermine the president and frankly, make us less safe as a country. It also gives the mullahs of Iran. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  Oh, another talking point. Oh, the Democrats, they even say. Now we're getting lectures. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=54.32000000000001s)]
*  Get this from the Benghazi Democrats, the bribe Iranian mullah appeasers in the swamp. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=59.36s)]
*  How did that Biden Obama $150 billion bribe work out for any of us? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=66.32s)]
*  The answer we now know. It was a disaster. And now the president is cleaning up their created mess. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=73.84s)]
*  Even Obama's DHS secretary believes President Trump utilized his full [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=80.72s)]
*  constitutional authority to take this action. And yes, we are better off. Take a look. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=85.28s)]
*  If you believe everything that our government is saying about General Soleimani, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=91.6s)]
*  he was a lawful military objective. And the president under his constitutional authority [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=96.48s)]
*  as commander in chief had ample domestic legal authority to take him out without an additional [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=103.6s)]
*  congressional authorization. The hypocrisy as usual palpable. And let's not forget Secretary [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=110.08s)]
*  Johnson's former boss, President Obama. He himself launched 2,800 strikes in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=116.32s)]
*  Guess what, Nancy? No congressional approval. The speaker had no problem with any of that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Now when President Trump, he takes out the leading terrorist and American soldier killer [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=129.44s)]
*  outside of Baghdad, and she wants answers. All this is a repulsive, continuous, never ending [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=136.64s)]
*  double standards, more feigned, selective moral outrage. Only this time it impacts our safety [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=143.11999999999998s)]
*  and security at home, our fellow American citizens abroad, our interests abroad. So let me educate [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=150.88s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi. Let me educate all the other far left rage filled idiots in the media mob and elsewhere. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=158.07999999999998s)]
*  We have a new segment we're starting right now tonight called How to Deal with the World's Most [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=166.32s)]
*  Evil Terrorists for Dummies. First and foremost, you can't live in fear. Second, you can't bribe [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=171.6s)]
*  your sworn enemies into liking you. That is called appeasement. Appeasement, when you try it, always [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=179.04s)]
*  results in further aggression. What you're doing is you're literally teaching our enemies how to [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=185.6s)]
*  blackmail you. Iranian aggression must be checked or it will get worse, and it has gotten worse and [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=190.4s)]
*  worse and worse. They must know their hostile actions have consequences and they don't get to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=196.0s)]
*  shoot at our drones and take them out of the sky. They don't get to take oil tankers hostage in the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=201.84s)]
*  very narrow straits of Hormuz. They don't get to disrupt the world's oil supply, the lifeblood of [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=208.48s)]
*  the world's economy, by then hitting the Saudis so they can make more money. They don't get to kill [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=214.8s)]
*  our fellow Americans in Iraq. They don't get to actively plot the murder of American State [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=221.12s)]
*  Department employees abroad. They don't get to orchestrate the attacks on our embassy, our family, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=226.32s)]
*  our U.S. family, our interests, American territory. They don't get to fund terrorism worldwide. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=233.44s)]
*  They can't fight their proxy wars all across the globe as they've been doing, and they can't try [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=240.4s)]
*  and take over the entire region and not expect some reprisals. The Iranians, frankly, have been [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=245.44s)]
*  fighting against us in the civilized world since 1979. That is a fact. 150 billion in cash and [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=253.84s)]
*  other currencies did nothing to change that, and tonight the hostile regime in Iran is reeling. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=261.2s)]
*  Their top terrorist, Soleimani, will never see the light of day. Good riddance by his daughter [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=267.36s)]
*  proclaiming American soldiers will now be murdered all over the world in retaliation. Iran's government [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=273.76s)]
*  vowing to take revenge. On state TV, one official offering an 80 million dollar bounty for President [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=279.84s)]
*  Trump's head. Now, that would be called saber rattling. By the way, this for the Iranians is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=286.24s)]
*  pretty much an average day. They hate America, they hate Israel, they threaten to wipe Israel off the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=292.24s)]
*  map, and they want to take out America too. That's the daily feeling. It's been that way since 1979. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=297.84s)]
*  They are bad evil actors in Iran. They're evil, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're stupid. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=304.56s)]
*  They know that there's a new sheriff in town tonight. They now know tonight the days of 150 [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=311.12s)]
*  billion dollars in bribes and cash, you know, the currencies dropped on their tarmac are now over, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=317.12s)]
*  and they better know that if any retribution does occur, it will result in serious and lethal [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=323.2s)]
*  consequences. I warned them that this would happen, oh, just a couple of months ago. They will pay the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=330.15999999999997s)]
*  deadliest of price, and without a doubt, they are now in a position of weakness, and we control the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=336.71999999999997s)]
*  single most powerful advanced sophisticated military in the entire world with the greatest [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=343.28s)]
*  intelligence agencies. Remember I kept saying the 99 percent? We saw this in action. President Trump [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=349.6s)]
*  has already identified at least 52 Iranian targets that the U.S. will take out if needed, and no, [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  we can't and we won't be going with boots on the ground in Iran. That's not going to happen, and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  frankly, it's not necessary. Instead, the president's been clear. We will strategically take out the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=371.04s)]
*  mullahs' ability to continue this reckless behavior, this saber rattling, these attempts [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=377.36s)]
*  to bribe other countries or get paid or blackmail other countries. They are not going to be able to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=384.64s)]
*  disrupt the lifeblood of the world's economy, oil, as much as they've been trying. Now, we are not, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=390.72s)]
*  and let me be clear, I do not support boots on the ground. After Vietnam and Iraq and the swamp [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=397.12s)]
*  creatures, they send our brave men and women, our national treasure door to door, endless wars, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=403.2s)]
*  and then they say never mind, those days must forever be over. I've been saying this for some [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=409.52s)]
*  time. This is about what I've been calling the next generation of weaponry, offensive and defensive, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=414.0s)]
*  much of which is already at our disposal. In other words, that can and will be utilized to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=420.24s)]
*  strike Iran's dictatorship where it will hurt them the most. They got three major oil refineries, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=426.48s)]
*  and we know where they are. They have nuclear facilities. We know where they are. We know Iran's [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=432.48s)]
*  terrorist network, maybe even the mullahs themselves, maybe the mullahs, they're so brave, maybe President [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=437.52000000000004s)]
*  Rouhani, maybe he and the mullahs can hang out in one of those three major refineries. Good luck if [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  they do, because at this very moment, I can promise you the United States military has the power to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=448.64000000000004s)]
*  wreak total complete havoc to this hostile regime in Iran. And by the way, they can do it in a control [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=454.64000000000004s)]
*  room right here in an air conditioned room in Tampa or maybe Nevada, anywhere in the continental [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=461.44s)]
*  United States, and they can do so in a matter of minutes. That's a fact. The days of bribing our [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=467.04s)]
*  enemies and dictators and evil doers around the world, if you will, are over. There'll be no palettes [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=473.28s)]
*  of cash left on a tarmac for the mullahs and for Iran. Iran's dictatorship, they have a choice. They [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=480.88s)]
*  either comply, they learn their lesson, or they will feel pain like never before. You knock out [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=486.64s)]
*  those three refineries, their economy will totally and completely collapse. And despite the whining [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=491.76s)]
*  and the complaining, predictably among Democrats and the stupid commentators on TV and the media [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=498.15999999999997s)]
*  mob, top military experts agree that the president's strategy is effective. In fact, General David [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=504.56s)]
*  Petraeus said that this strike against Soleimani was a bigger deal than killing Bin Laden. I put a [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=511.92s)]
*  lot of faith in what Petraeus has to say. Let's take a look. What has happened here, I think, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=518.96s)]
*  is frankly that we lost the element of deterrence, the component deterrence that was seen as American [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=525.44s)]
*  will. So ultimately the president appears to have decided that it was necessary to take an action to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=532.32s)]
*  shore up deterrence to show that we were not going to accept this. I think the administration [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=538.8s)]
*  understands that there's a serious risk of consequences here. I think they understand [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=543.12s)]
*  that it's unlikely that the Iranian regime is going to now come hand in hand to the negotiating table. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=548.88s)]
*  But the president showed restraint and he put a red line out there, Sandra. He said, look it, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=554.8s)]
*  if you kill Americans, then I'm going to respond. And when that took place, this president responded. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=560.16s)]
*  President showed more patience than I thought he'd even show. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L97RvwXFHdw&t=566.8s)]
