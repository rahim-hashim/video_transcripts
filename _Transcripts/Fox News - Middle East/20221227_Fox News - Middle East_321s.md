# Is China having 'buyer's remorse' because of Russia-Ukraine war?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 27, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M)
*  Aisha, for more on this, who better to turn to than Dan Hoffman, Fox News contributor [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=0.0s)]
*  and former CIA chief of station. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=3.96s)]
*  Let's get to what the Russian government has said about this, Dan. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=7.24s)]
*  This is from Sergey Lavrov. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=10.58s)]
*  He's the Russian foreign minister. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=11.58s)]
*  He said, quote, as for the duration of the conflict, the ball is on the side of the Kiev [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=12.84s)]
*  regime and Washington that stands behind its back. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=17.92s)]
*  They may stop senseless resistance at any moment. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=21.94s)]
*  Are we any closer to any type of real, legitimate negotiation or is this the same posturing [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=26.08s)]
*  that we've seen, Dan, for the last 10 months? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=32.36s)]
*  You know, the Kremlin's maximalist demands and their brutal tactics haven't changed from [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=36.72s)]
*  the very onset of this war over 300 days ago. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=41.26s)]
*  Foreign Minister Lavrov is saying quite simply, stop resisting unilateral disarmament so that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=45.64s)]
*  Russia can complete the annexation of those territories that Vladimir Putin announced [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=50.68s)]
*  even though part of the territory of Kherson is under Ukraine's control and they can topple [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=55.84s)]
*  the Zelensky government. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=60.28s)]
*  That's what Russia wants. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  They don't want to be subjected to the justice they deserve over the war crimes they've committed [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  indiscriminately targeting Ukrainians in their hospitals, their schools and their neighborhoods [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=67.68s)]
*  and targeting Ukraine's civilian infrastructure and denying so much of the population 40 percent [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=72.68s)]
*  without power. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=79.08000000000001s)]
*  Those are egregious war crimes and Russia doesn't want to be subjected to the justice [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=81.04s)]
*  for which they richly deserve. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  What's the mindset of the Putin regime here as they have utterly failed to take the capital, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=88.56s)]
*  to topple the Ukrainian government, they've had supply chain problems, they've had troop [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=94.56s)]
*  level problems. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=99.10000000000001s)]
*  All of these issues now as they lead an occupation that's turned out to really be somewhat of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=100.4s)]
*  a mess here. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=105.48s)]
*  Is there a disconnect or how do they come to terms with how this war has gone over the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=107.36s)]
*  past 10 months? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=113.4s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is at his most weakened state over the past 20 years. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=117.6s)]
*  This war has done nothing but cause his reign in the Kremlin to be more tenuous than ever [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=123.14s)]
*  before and his regime security is absolutely on the line. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=128.88s)]
*  Russia considered Ukraine an existential threat because what scares Putin is democracy. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=133.2s)]
*  Could never have Ukraine seeking to have commercial ties with the European Union and military [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=137.95999999999998s)]
*  ties with NATO and build a functioning democracy on Russia's border. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=145.0s)]
*  That's what scared Vladimir Putin the most and why ultimately he decided that he needed [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=150.92s)]
*  to invade, topple the Zelensky government and install his own puppet regime. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=154.83999999999997s)]
*  He's failed miserably and Ukraine has exposed Russia's weakness and they're done more than [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=159.64s)]
*  any NATO member has ever done to cut Russia's military down to size and they've also made [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  a bit of a wedge in the Russia-China alliance. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=172.04s)]
*  China's got to be having buyer's remorse over their relationship, their partnership with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=175.04s)]
*  Russia and China has to be seeing that now the West has been awakened from their post-Cold [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=180.11999999999998s)]
*  War slumber and is ready to do something to help Ukraine to fight for democracy and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=186.12s)]
*  freedom and liberty in the face of this brutal Russian onslaught. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=191.94s)]
*  Now Dan, on the flip side of that, you've also got the United States that has been forced [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=195.56s)]
*  to spend tens of billions of dollars, lots of attention and focus on that region when [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=200.36s)]
*  this long-awaited pivot to Asia and focusing on China seems to be compromised yet again. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  How much does that hurt the U.S. posture in East Asia? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=211.0s)]
*  Well, look, I think the United States, I saw this from my decades of service at the CIA, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=215.6s)]
*  we could talk all we want about what we'd like to focus on but sometimes a crisis will [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=223.0s)]
*  happen somewhere in the world and we're just going to have to deal with it and as much [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=228.44s)]
*  as the Biden administration would have preferred not to have to support Ukraine in this war, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=232.16s)]
*  that's the way it worked out and our return on investment has been quite significant as [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=237.28s)]
*  I mentioned and Ukraine's, the price that Ukraine has paid has been significant. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=241.84s)]
*  Look at the hundred thousand roughly casualties of Ukrainians and the same on the Russian [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=246.32s)]
*  side. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=250.56s)]
*  Ukraine is fighting with everything they've got and they're not going to give up until [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  the Russians have left their territory and that includes the Donbass and Crimea and so [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=257.16s)]
*  I've always felt from the intelligence side we've got to be able to do everything at once. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=262.0s)]
*  Things are all interconnected and I think the more we help Ukraine fight against Russia [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=266.6s)]
*  and show that a nuclear armed state can't simply invade another and mount what Fiona [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=270.53999999999996s)]
*  Hill is rightly called an imperial land grab, the more we help Taiwan and our allies in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  Asia and the more we cut China down to size as well. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=280.82s)]
*  So I think all of these things are interconnected in an effective foreign policy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=283.76s)]
*  The world is so interconnected now. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=289.06s)]
*  We really need to be prepared to deal with multiple fronts, whether it's North Korea, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program, transnational terrorism, China, Russia. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=296.66s)]
*  That's the challenge for the Biden administration. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=300.90000000000003s)]
*  Have to stay nimble. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=303.06s)]
*  Sometimes history gets in the way of the best laid plans. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=304.06s)]
*  Dan Hoffman, always a pleasure. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=306.22s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YinHtmRZ8M&t=307.94s)]
