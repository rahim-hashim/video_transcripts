# Biden admin is giving Iran the ‘green light,’ former secretary of state says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8)
*  This Sunday morning with the very latest out of Israel as we approach the one year mark [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=0.0s)]
*  since Hamas' deadly and unprovoked attacks on Israel last October 7th. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=3.94s)]
*  This week a pivotal one as Israel launched a series of strikes Friday in Beirut and decimated [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  the leadership of Hezbollah, capping a week of airstrikes across southern Lebanon, including [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=14.38s)]
*  covert attacks that caused electronic pagers and devices carried by thousands of Hezbollah [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=19.36s)]
*  terrorists to explode virtually simultaneously in a major blow to the terrorist group. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=24.2s)]
*  Joining me now with a look at the week and its impact on the war on Israel is the former [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=29.96s)]
*  Secretary of State and Fox News contributor Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=33.3s)]
*  Secretary, good to see you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=36.64s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining us. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=38.04s)]
*  Great to be with you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=40.6s)]
*  Good morning Maria. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=41.6s)]
*  How would you assess this past week? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=42.6s)]
*  How important was this week in terms of these covert actions from Israel on Hezbollah? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=43.6s)]
*  So it was a big week, an important week where the Israelis sent a message they're no longer [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=50.72s)]
*  keeping 80 or 90,000 people out of their homes in northern Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=56.74s)]
*  They're going to come solve that problem. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=60.940000000000005s)]
*  And so a brilliant operation for sure with respect to the pagers sent a message that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=62.86s)]
*  says we can reach you, we can touch you. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=68.18s)]
*  This is the first act in a multi-series multi-act play. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  Hezbollah surely knows that and its leader Nasrallah must be calculating. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=74.5s)]
*  How far is Tehran willing to go to back me to continue to push on Israel while Israel [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=79.02000000000001s)]
*  is wiping Hamas off the face of the earth and about to do the same to me? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=85.14s)]
*  So a big strategic week for Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=89.38s)]
*  Clearly they've made a decision that they can no longer live with seven, eight, nine [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=91.66s)]
*  thousand precision guided munitions sitting on the suburbs of Beirut and around them. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=95.94s)]
*  And they're going to go for it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=101.38s)]
*  Iran now has a tough decision and sadly it is not feeling any threat from the United [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=102.38s)]
*  States of America in terms of responding to what Iran has been doing these last 50 weeks [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=106.48s)]
*  since October 7th of last year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=110.7s)]
*  Yeah, I want to ask you about Iran and this failure of deterrence on the U.S. as part. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=112.7s)]
*  But first, I thought it was really interesting that the U.S. comes out after the explosions [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=116.54s)]
*  of the pagers and devices and says we knew nothing about this. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=120.94s)]
*  What does that tell you in terms of Israel sharing information with the U.S. now? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=125.10000000000001s)]
*  Maria, this is really important. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=129.74s)]
*  This tells you all you need to know about the Israeli's trust of the United States [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=132.78s)]
*  today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=137.1s)]
*  If they had an operation like that, they almost always would have notified the United [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=138.1s)]
*  States in the advance of the attack. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=141.82s)]
*  But this time, no, this time they didn't notify us probably because they felt like the Biden [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  administration would tell them no, you can't do this. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=148.34s)]
*  If you do this, we will go to the U.N., we will hold up weapon systems. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=150.26s)]
*  And so they said, you know, what the heck, we're just going to do this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=153.98s)]
*  We'll ask for forgiveness. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=156.5s)]
*  That is a deep breach of trust, a way that we didn't have while we were in office for [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=158.22s)]
*  four years. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=162.88s)]
*  And frankly, the United States and Israel haven't had for a long time. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=163.98s)]
*  The Israelis don't trust us. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=166.78s)]
*  And frankly, our friends, the Gulf Arab states in the region have no confidence in us either. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=168.42s)]
*  That's unbelievable. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=173.04s)]
*  So where does this go? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=174.04s)]
*  What does this mean? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=175.22s)]
*  We haven't really heard any articulate response from Kamala Harris in terms of her plans regarding [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=176.22s)]
*  foreign policy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=181.42000000000002s)]
*  You're not going to hear anything from Vice President Harris on this because we've that's [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=184.9s)]
*  different from what you saw during eight years of President Obama and now four years of her [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=187.98s)]
*  and President Biden's leadership. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=192.66s)]
*  Their theory of the case is appease the Iranians, negotiate with them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=194.9s)]
*  There are moderates there. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=198.38s)]
*  We can all sing Kumbaya and find our way forward when the reality is the Iranians have now [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=199.38s)]
*  taken six billion dollars from the United States in exchange for hostages, now holding [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=204.42000000000002s)]
*  more American hostages in Gaza. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=210.22s)]
*  They killed 1200 Israeli and American citizens on October 7th. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=212.58s)]
*  And our response has been, hey, can we just get a ceasefire? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=217.06s)]
*  This is this this signals to the world that America has left the global stage. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=220.9s)]
*  We're not prepared to defend the things that matter to us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=224.94s)]
*  And the risk of escalation resulting from this American weakness, this failure of deterrence [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  is very real. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=231.9s)]
*  These last what, three and a half months of the Biden administration. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=233.06s)]
*  Well, this is really discouraging. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=236.9s)]
*  And I want to get your take on how that plays out in terms of this failure of deterrence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=239.3s)]
*  You've said this many times, the fact that this administration has failed to deter Iran [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=243.86s)]
*  and that's why they just keep doing it, supporting all of these proxies. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  No, that's exactly right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=254.66s)]
*  Think about all that's going on while Vice President Harris tells the world in a debate [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  that there's no Americans in combat in harm's way. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=260.5s)]
*  Our our sailors are sitting in the Red Sea and in the Mediterranean, coming under all [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=263.38s)]
*  kinds of threats from drones and missiles. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=268.06s)]
*  We've had sailors killed in this effort. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=270.7s)]
*  We've got soldiers still in the Middle East, and yet they claim nothing to see here, folks. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=273.86s)]
*  If you're the Ayatollah, that is a absolute green light to continue to threaten the Israelis, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=278.7s)]
*  continue to threaten the Saudis and the Emiratis. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=284.38s)]
*  And frankly, if you're Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin in those other theaters that are deeply [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=286.98s)]
*  connected as well, you say this is the time for us to go, this is the time for us to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=291.3s)]
*  seize the moment when America is either absent or way on its back foot. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=296.38s)]
*  And Vice President Harris has nothing to add on this topic different from what they've [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=300.9s)]
*  done for these last three and a half years. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=304.54s)]
*  Secretary, we just showed a graphic of all of the people who have been eliminated at [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=306.3s)]
*  the top of Hezbollah. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=311.54s)]
*  I want to get your take on whether or not the U.S. is, in fact, supplying Israel with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  what it needs. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=318.38s)]
*  Are we in fact, because I know there are voters out there who have become one issue voters [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=319.38s)]
*  and they were very upset that the administration, the Biden-Harris administration, held back [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=324.82s)]
*  weapons to Israel during the literally the fight of its life. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=330.34000000000003s)]
*  So my question is, are we supplying what fully IDF needs to defend its people? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=335.1s)]
*  What about replenishing the Iron Dome ordinance? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=339.9s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=342.66s)]
*  So from what I know, we provided them with a great deal of sustainment support that they [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=345.78000000000003s)]
*  need. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=350.62s)]
*  But Maria, here's the thing about it is it's always come with restrictions. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=351.62s)]
*  We've threatened to pull it if they don't come to Cairo and talk about a ceasefire, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=355.62s)]
*  which would be a total gift to Hamas terrorists. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=359.98s)]
*  We've threatened to withhold it if they don't comply with the rule of armed conflict. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=363.46s)]
*  Goodness gracious, the Israeli Defense Forces, much like American forces, understand deeply [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=368.18s)]
*  that there's a set of rules for how to conduct conflict. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=372.85999999999996s)]
*  The Pager exercise was a precision strike against Hezbollah leadership, for goodness [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=375.5s)]
*  sake. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=379.74s)]
*  And so there's always restrictions. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=380.74s)]
*  There's always hesitancy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=381.97999999999996s)]
*  What we've not done is we have told the Israelis, you tell us what you need, we'll make sure [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=383.29999999999995s)]
*  that you have it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=387.7s)]
*  We are not going to confine you when you're trying to defend yourself because we understand [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=388.7s)]
*  that the fight you're undertaking is against Iran, against the leadership in Tehran, and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=392.26s)]
*  it is a fight that we're engaged in as well because they want to wipe us off the map in [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=396.94s)]
*  the same way they seek to destroy Israel. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=401.18s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=403.94s)]
*  Secretary, great to get your insights. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=404.94s)]
*  We so appreciate your time this morning. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Maria. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=407.46s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=408.46s)]
*  Have a great morning. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=409.46s)]
*  And to you, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=410.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=422.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gh01qyYjqT8&t=423.26s)]
