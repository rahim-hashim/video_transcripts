# Iran launches more than 100 drones at Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU)
*  Jonathan, good evening. I do want to start with some breaking news. Israel's top military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=0.0s)]
*  spokesperson just announced that Iran has launched 100 drones at Israel. It will take [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=4.68s)]
*  them a couple of hours to get here, and likely, as we have seen in the past, they could be [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  coupled with some sort of missile fire. But this is the first part of what we expect to [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=15.68s)]
*  be a multi-pronged response from the Iranians. Following these Israeli strikes overnight, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=20.88s)]
*  they came in waves targeting Iranian nuclear facilities, also top officials in Tehran, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=27.4s)]
*  including nuclear scientists and the head of the IRGC. As we move forward here, we should [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=33.64s)]
*  look at the special instructions that have been given to Israeli civilians. Israel's [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=39.68s)]
*  home front command, the arm of the military responsible for communicating with the civilian [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=43.8s)]
*  population, has told people to stay close to bomb shelters. Israel's prime minister [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  says the instructions may last for longer than previous times during the more than [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=53.28s)]
*  600-day war that Israel has been facing. And as we try to put this into context, the question [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=58.2s)]
*  now is not only, A, how the Iranians are going to respond, but B, if this is going to drag [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  out into a days or even weeks-long event. We heard tonight from President Trump speaking [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=69.58s)]
*  with Brett Baer, saying that he still hopes Iran will come back to the negotiating table, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=74.8s)]
*  but everything is up in the air right now. And as we look at what happened tonight, these [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=80.58s)]
*  waves of Israeli strikes that targeted Iranian facilities, individuals and missile production [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=83.74s)]
*  sites, it's a sign that Israel's not looking just to send a message to the Iranian regime, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=88.78s)]
*  but truly trying to damage their nuclear facilities so that it would at least set back their nuclear [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=94.1s)]
*  program amid these conversations that have been taking place between the Americans and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=99.38s)]
*  the Iranians. But again, the latest information that we have, Iran has launched 100 drones [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=104.26s)]
*  at Israel. According to Israel's top military spokesman, efforts are already underway to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=109.9s)]
*  try and shoot them down. Jonathan? And Trey, the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=115.22s)]
*  who clearly indicating that this could go on for days, could go on for a couple of weeks. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=120.46000000000001s)]
*  I wonder how your impressions are of how the Israeli people are responding to this. In [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=126.34s)]
*  terms of the emotional strain on them, they have been through so much since the October [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=134.9s)]
*  7 attacks. How are they now looking at this thinking, okay, this is yet another front [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=140.74s)]
*  opened and it's one that's going to stay open a while, it seems? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=147.86s)]
*  It's a great question. Israel's been at war for more than 615 days and this war started [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=153.06s)]
*  with the October 7 massacre, a terrorist attack in the fall of 2023 that led to Hamas, the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=158.3s)]
*  group in control of Gaza, taking hostages and slaughtering 1200 people. Some of those [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=165.5s)]
*  hostages still remain in Hamas captivity, 53 of them, and 20 of them are believed to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=171.42000000000002s)]
*  be alive. And so this is a country that hasn't completed mourning following that massacre. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=176.1s)]
*  They're still waiting for loved ones to come home. And now yet another front has opened [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=180.98s)]
*  up for this country. And so I will say it's a country that is quite resilient and the [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=185.42s)]
*  people are used to this, unfortunately. They're used to coming under missile and rocket fire, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=190.33999999999997s)]
*  but it does certainly interrupt the flow of the society because there is a real risk to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=196.57999999999998s)]
*  the population when we're talking about the potential of drones and ballistic missiles [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  soaring through the skies above major cities like Tel Aviv where we're standing right now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=205.17999999999998s)]
*  And then from a logistics standpoint, school is cancelled, jobs are cancelled, and a parade [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=210.52s)]
*  that was supposed to take place today in Tel Aviv is also cancelled. And it just gives [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=215.48000000000002s)]
*  you a sense of how this interrupts daily life for the Israeli people, but they are listening [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=219.08s)]
*  to the instructions so far. There's very few people that are out. Normally you would see [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=223.68s)]
*  people running along the beach and they would be enjoying the first day of the weekend. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=227.88s)]
*  That's not the case today, Jonathan. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=232.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, we are very grateful to have you there for your analysis and also your empathy [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=234.08s)]
*  as always. Trey, thank you so much. Back to you throughout the next few hours. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjT_P5QtxaU&t=239.4s)]
