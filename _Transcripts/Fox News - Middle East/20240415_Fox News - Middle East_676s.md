# Sean Hannity: Biden is ‘willing and able’ to throw Israel under the bus
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ)
*  And welcome to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Tonight we begin with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=3.52s)]
*  Tonight the world is on high alert after Iran's massive attack against Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now, at this hour, we are monitoring the skies over Iran as we await a forceful response [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=10.56s)]
*  that had been promised from Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  This as we also now tonight track multiple major stories, including a blatant political [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=19.32s)]
*  smear campaign. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=24.04s)]
*  Oh, that's disguised as a criminal trial. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=25.28s)]
*  Jury selection now underway in New York City, where the very leftist district attorney Alvin [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  Bragg is determined to prosecute Donald Trump for a decade-old defunct misdemeanor surrounding [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=34.64s)]
*  the labeling of business documents. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=41.0s)]
*  Now, the bogus charges are well past the statute of limitations, but Alvin Bragg has mysteriously [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=43.36s)]
*  upcharged what would be misdemeanors into felonies by tying in a federal election case [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=49.379999999999995s)]
*  that was specifically never prosecuted even by Biden's weaponized DOJ. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=55.919999999999995s)]
*  If this all sounds convoluted to you, that's because it is. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  These are not legitimate charges. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=65.36s)]
*  This is not a legitimate trial. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=67.08s)]
*  It is a perfectly timed political scheme led by a prosecutor who did campaign on, quote, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=69.42s)]
*  getting Trump, sound familiar, and presided over by a judge whose family is deeply involved [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  in democratic politics. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=80.66s)]
*  Now, coming up, we're going to explain in detail the real truth behind the bogus Trump [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=82.28s)]
*  trial in New York City and why weaponized justice is now posing a real, clear, serious [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=87.28s)]
*  threat to our country and to constitutional order, something Democrats say they care about [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  but obviously do not. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=99.4s)]
*  But first, we have officially reached yet another low point, maybe the lowest, from [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=100.72s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=105.12s)]
*  Today, disruptive protests broke out all across the country. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  We have far-left wing Biden supporting agitators blocking airport traffic in Chicago, others [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  causing a massive traffic jam on the Golden Gate Bridge, and state after state angry far-left [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  demonstrators causing chaos, blocking traffic, and this nothing but a vile nationwide protest [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=122.56s)]
*  against Israel, yet one day after the world's only Jewish state was brutally attacked by [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=128.96s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=135.96s)]
*  Over the weekend, you had this unprecedented escalation of violence from Iran. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=137.28s)]
*  Israel faced more than 60 tons of airborne explosives, including 170 drones, more than [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  30 cruise missiles and over 120 ballistic missiles, most of which were launched directly [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=148.36s)]
*  from inside Iran's borders. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  Now, following the attack, where, you know, here was Joe Biden's message to our closest [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=156.8s)]
*  ally in the Middle East, you're on your own, and we won't support you if you defend [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=162.24s)]
*  yourself and fight back against radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=167.3s)]
*  This all happened during a call with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=171.34s)]
*  Biden reportedly urging Israel not to fight back, emphasizing that the U.S. will not participate [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=176.34s)]
*  in a response against the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=182.94s)]
*  The contents of that call, they were then leaked to the press, likely by the Biden White [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=187.04s)]
*  House. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=191.3s)]
*  So, you have to ask, why is Joe Biden so openly hostile to one of America's closest allies [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=192.3s)]
*  as it is fighting for its very existence and its very survival? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=198.94s)]
*  And where is Joe Biden's moral compass? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=203.5s)]
*  Why is there no moral clarity when it comes to taking a stand, again, against the number [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=206.06s)]
*  one state sponsor of terror? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  The answer is very sad and beyond pathetic, probably the low life, low moment of his presidency, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=213.46s)]
*  which says a lot. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  If you take a look, you want to know where this begins? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=221.3s)]
*  In Michigan, the Democratic primary, over 100,000 voters cast their ballots for uncommitted. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=223.38000000000002s)]
*  In other words, 18.9 percent of Democrats in the Democratic primary would not vote for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=229.22s)]
*  Joe Biden, in large part because they sensed he was supporting Israel too much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=235.46s)]
*  In Wisconsin, nearly 50,000 issued uncommitted protest votes against Joe, well, again, probably [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=240.78s)]
*  because of his—what was really tepid support for Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=247.58s)]
*  So now Joe, he's trying to appeal and appease his radical base, you know, the ones that [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=251.22s)]
*  are—look at your screen, blocking traffic on critical bridges and thoroughfares, others [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=256.74s)]
*  seen here in Chicago chanting, if you can believe it, Death to Israel, Death to America. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=262.26s)]
*  This is our country. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=267.98s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=268.98s)]
*  So, it has two meanings, depending on who you're with. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=269.98s)]
*  It can mean death to or down with. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=274.98s)]
*  So— [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=276.98s)]
*  Can we get a mind-bart on recall? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=277.98s)]
*  We can get a mind-bart on recall. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=278.98s)]
*  Mind-bart America! [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  Mind-bart America! [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  Mind-bart America! [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=283.78000000000003s)]
*  Mind-bart America! [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  Mind-bart America! [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  We'll play you that full tape straight ahead tonight. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=286.78000000000003s)]
*  Plus, we will show you how the peace-loving ceasefire crowd literally celebrating Iran's [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=291.5s)]
*  attack against Israel. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=297.26s)]
*  There are now a growing number of people living inside of the United States that not only [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=299.18s)]
*  hate Israel, but seem to hate our country as well and our way of life. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=304.1s)]
*  And they are now openly aiding both Hamas and the terrorist state of Iran. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=308.78s)]
*  How is that not being morally repugnant? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=313.97999999999996s)]
*  But in an effort to appease his radical base and win back voters that he's been bleeding, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=318.7s)]
*  you know, and a few thousand votes in Michigan and elsewhere around the country, Joe is ready, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=323.73999999999995s)]
*  willing, and he's clearly willing and able to throw Israel under the bus as they now [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=329.05999999999995s)]
*  fight back against radical terrorists out of Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran, all supported [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=335.46s)]
*  by Iran, the Islamic Republic of Iran that is now wealthier and more emboldened. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=341.58s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=347.06s)]
*  Because of Joe Neville Chamberlain Biden, beginning during his time with Obama. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=348.06s)]
*  Remember, Biden worked hard on that Iranian deal to appease Iran for nearly two decades. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=352.54s)]
*  the insane nuclear deal that remember the one that freed up $150 billion for the mullahs [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=359.06s)]
*  of Iran in exchange for a mere promise that they won't build a nuclear weapon. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=365.29999999999995s)]
*  And a short time later in 2016, the Obama administration paid out yet another $1.7 billion [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=370.53999999999996s)]
*  to the mullahs in Iran to free five American hostages. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=377.09999999999997s)]
*  And then as President Biden once again unfreezing billions of dollars for Iran, this time he [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  had authorized $6 billion to free five American hostages. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=387.08s)]
*  Boy, the price went up quite a bit. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=390.88s)]
*  Biden also eliminated critical sanctions against the sale of Iranian oil and flat out stopped [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  enforcing any and all other sanctions. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=399.8s)]
*  What's the result of that? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=402.96s)]
*  The Islamic Republic, led by the mullahs of Iran that were headed towards bankruptcy under [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=404.32s)]
*  Donald Trump, they have profited to the tune of $80 to $100 billion under Joe Biden. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=408.64s)]
*  And you can throw in another $10 billion for the sale of energy and electricity and oil [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=415.32s)]
*  and gas to Iraq that Biden also authorized. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=421.2s)]
*  Biden also waived sanctions targeting Iran's nuclear program. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=425.38s)]
*  And in response to Biden's, quote, generosity, the mullahs of Iran have now upended peace [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=429.28s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  They're funding violent proxies all over the region, like Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=435.59999999999997s)]
*  Islamic Jihad and Hamas. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=440.71999999999997s)]
*  The barbaric attack on October 7th, remember, almost 1,200 Israelis died that day, might [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=443.02000000000004s)]
*  not have been possible without Joe Biden's policy of appeasement and the enrichment of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=448.42s)]
*  Iran. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=453.70000000000005s)]
*  Iran has also rapidly accelerated their nuclear program. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=454.70000000000005s)]
*  And now they have attacked Israel directly for the first time in history, only two days [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=458.42s)]
*  after Biden issued this very tepid warning before shuffling off to the beach for what [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=462.90000000000003s)]
*  was supposed to be a relaxing weekend. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=469.62s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=471.8s)]
*  How imminent do you think an attack on Israel is from Iran, Mr. President? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=473.18s)]
*  I want to get this secure information, but my expectation is sooner or later. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=477.26s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your message to Iran right now? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=481.54s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your message to Iran in this moment? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=485.54s)]
*  Don't. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=488.54s)]
*  Don't? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=492.18s)]
*  That's it? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=493.18s)]
*  Our closest ally in the Middle East is facing an imminent attack from the world's number [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=495.14000000000004s)]
*  one sponsor of terrorism, and Biden can only muster one word? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=500.62s)]
*  Don't? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=506.22s)]
*  Joe, they did. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=507.22s)]
*  Your appeasement bought you nothing. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=510.22s)]
*  And then after Iran attacks Israel, the president didn't bother addressing this country or [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=512.62s)]
*  a peer in public. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=518.22s)]
*  And get this, Senator Lankford is now demanding answers after the Biden administration allegedly [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=519.78s)]
*  granted a U.S. visa to Iran's foreign minister after they attacked our top ally to appear [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=525.14s)]
*  in this country later this week. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  Iran is responsible for killing Americans, you might recall, taking American hostages, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=534.02s)]
*  launching a strike against our closest ally, and you've got Joe, Neville, Chamberlain, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=539.26s)]
*  Biden doing nothing in response. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=544.02s)]
*  He won't even deny a visa to their foreign minister after this attack. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=546.14s)]
*  message to Iran and the rest of the world that is involved in terror. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=551.9000000000001s)]
*  It should be crystal clear. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=556.6600000000001s)]
*  We will support our allies and our friends, and we will, by the way, we will fight for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=558.6600000000001s)]
*  our citizens and never lift a finger to help any country that foments and supports terrorism. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=564.5s)]
*  So how does this all end? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=571.7800000000001s)]
*  With or without support of Biden, Israel, they will need to channel Winston Churchill [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=573.5s)]
*  in order to survive what is a threat to their existence. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=579.18s)]
*  Let's take a trip down memory lane. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=583.02s)]
*  I have nothing to offer but blood, toil, tears, and sweat. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=585.22s)]
*  We have before us an ordeal of the most weavest kind. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=592.22s)]
*  We have before us many, many long months of struggle and of suffering. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=597.22s)]
*  You ask, what is our aim? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=602.26s)]
*  I can answer in one word, victory. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=605.1s)]
*  Victory at all costs. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=608.38s)]
*  Victory in spite of all terror. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=610.5799999999999s)]
*  Victory, however long and hard the road may be. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=613.5s)]
*  Blood, toil, tears and sweat. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=618.78s)]
*  What is our aim? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=621.4599999999999s)]
*  Victory. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=622.9799999999999s)]
*  We have long said on this program, appeasement, the likes of which Joe Biden is guilty of, [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=624.3399999999999s)]
*  will never work. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=629.8599999999999s)]
*  You must hold bad actors accountable or you will be destroyed. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=631.18s)]
*  And now Israel has an obligation to fight back or they will risk more of these attacks [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=635.3s)]
*  and probably worse. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=640.9799999999999s)]
*  But they clearly, with Joe Biden as president, will do so without a United States president [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=642.8599999999999s)]
*  that has any real moral compass or clarity and against what is a new axis of evil that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=648.3s)]
*  he is allowed to form under his watch. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=654.18s)]
*  And that would be Iran and Russia and China. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=657.0s)]
*  As we speak, by the way, Russia is now helping Iran harden its defenses. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sDDlnNM59aQ&t=660.04s)]
