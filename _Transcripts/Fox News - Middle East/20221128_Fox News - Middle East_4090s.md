# Karine Jean-Pierre holds White House briefing | 11/28/22
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98)
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome back from your Thanksgiving holiday. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=8.64s)]
*  Hope everyone had a restful and wonderful holiday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=12.16s)]
*  Okay, I'm going to be really quick at the top. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=15.8s)]
*  As you see, we have a guest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  As you know, we have a guest from National Security Council, John Kirby, with us today, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=19.36s)]
*  who's going to take your questions ahead of the state visit, as you know that it will [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=24.92s)]
*  be happening on Thursday, our first state visit with France, and first state visit, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=28.16s)]
*  clearly with the in this administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=35.88s)]
*  So with that, I'm going to just start right away and turn it over to Kirby. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=38.36s)]
*  All right, John. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=41.76s)]
*  As Kareen said, I've just got a couple of comments here at the top about the state visit [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  as the first state visit of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=51.04s)]
*  This is an opportunity to highlight a foundational component of this administration's approach [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=54.52s)]
*  to foreign policy, and that's through alliances. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=59.220000000000006s)]
*  France is a vital global partner and, of course, United States' oldest ally. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=62.28s)]
*  Our economic ties span established in cutting-edge sectors with major investments in both directions, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=67.88s)]
*  supporting hundreds of thousands of jobs in each country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  Our defense and security cooperation continues to expand and, of course, is vital to peace [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=76.28s)]
*  and stability all around the world. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=80.08000000000001s)]
*  Our partnership in tackling tough global challenges is underpinned by our shared commitment [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=83.28s)]
*  to democratic principles, values, and institutions. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=87.64s)]
*  And our cultural ties remain a source of strength and importance to our bilateral relationship. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=90.88s)]
*  France remains, as you know, a top destination for many Americans and vice versa. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=95.8s)]
*  So just briefly on the schedule breakdown, on Wednesday, President Macron will join Vice [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=100.72s)]
*  President Harris in visiting NASA headquarters to showcase our deepening collaboration on [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=105.88s)]
*  in support of Earth, climate, and space science and space exploration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=111.68s)]
*  The bulk of the state visit events will take place on Thursday, starting with the official [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=116.04s)]
*  arrival ceremony. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=121.92s)]
*  While President Biden and President Macron conduct a bilateral discussion, there will [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=124.92s)]
*  be a separate program for the First Lady and Mrs. Macron. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=130.36s)]
*  In the afternoon, the Vice President and Secretary Blinken will host a luncheon at the State [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  Department in honor of President and Mrs. Macron. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=138.2s)]
*  And then, of course, the visit culminates in a state dinner here at the White House [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=141.48s)]
*  that evening. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=144.76s)]
*  Throughout all of these events, you can expect to see on display both our long shared history [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=147.04s)]
*  as allies as well as our deep partnership in taking on the most urgent global challenges [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  of today and tomorrow. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=156.79999999999998s)]
*  We anticipate that we'll have more to share about the details of the state dinner and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=158.04s)]
*  the guest list later this week. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  While there are specific areas where we anticipate we'll make progress during this visit, I want [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=165.68s)]
*  to stress that this visit really largely serves as a celebration of the strong footing of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  this relationship, one that is well rooted in our history from the very beginnings of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=174.36s)]
*  our country and while also oriented squarely toward the future. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=178.84s)]
*  And it's a very dynamic, exciting future that we're looking forward to. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=182.72s)]
*  With that, we'll take some questions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=185.88s)]
*  Yeah, so John, I wonder if you could just say a few words about why France was chosen [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=188.68s)]
*  for the first state visit? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=194.28s)]
*  You sort of talked about the historic ties, but is this also kind of a gesture in terms [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=195.72s)]
*  of making the relationship a little smoother after the August dustbath last year? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=203.32s)]
*  I kind of alluded to it in the answer, Andrea. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=209.4s)]
*  A real kind of a long pole in the tent for President Biden's approach to foreign policy [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=213.24s)]
*  and to the world around us is the strength and power of alliances. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=219.32s)]
*  And our alliances is something that no other nation in the world can match in that work [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=225.24s)]
*  of American alliances. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=229.64s)]
*  France is our oldest one. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=231.56s)]
*  And, I mean, if you look at what's going on in Ukraine, look at what's going on in the [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=233.48s)]
*  Indo-Pacific and the tensions with China. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=239.88s)]
*  France is really at the center of all those things. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=241.88s)]
*  And President Macron has been a dynamic leader inside the G7, particularly there in Europe. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=244.04s)]
*  And so the President felt that this was exactly the right and the most appropriate country [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=251.16s)]
*  to start with for state visits. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=255.96s)]
*  Can I just follow up on that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=257.48s)]
*  One big issue that is dividing the U.S. and Europe at this moment are the EV credits and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=258.68s)]
*  the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  This is an issue. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I realize the way the EU is structured. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=266.84s)]
*  You know, the EU Brussels is in Georgia trade policy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=269.32s)]
*  Do you expect that issue to come up? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=272.04s)]
*  Do you think there's any chance of resolving that short of a WTO dispute? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=273.56s)]
*  I think certainly the issue will most likely come up. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=279.56s)]
*  I think we look forward to having that discussion with our French counterparts. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=282.44s)]
*  As you know, last month the United States stood up, helped stand up an EU-US IRA task [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  force just last month to try to make sure that we can better understand the concerns [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=295.16s)]
*  of our European friends about this and so many other issues. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=300.12s)]
*  The bottom line for us is, first of all, we want to understand the concerns. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=304.92s)]
*  We're absolutely willing to have that conversation and to find a way to work through those issues [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=308.44000000000005s)]
*  of concern. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=315.56s)]
*  But it's not a zero-sum game. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, clean energy, that's a tide that raises all boats. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=318.12s)]
*  The more we can transition to a clean energy economy around the world, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=322.84s)]
*  and there's plenty of opportunity for everybody in that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=327.32s)]
*  So we're looking forward to having those discussions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Brian. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  John, on a different topic, I was hoping, what is the White House's message, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=334.59999999999997s)]
*  the President's message to people in China who are [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=338.44s)]
*  peaceably protesting COVID lockdowns there? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=341.64s)]
*  And then did the topic of China's zero COVID policy come up in the presence of a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=344.2s)]
*  lot of meeting with President Xi when they met in Indonesia a couple weeks ago? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=348.6s)]
*  They did talk about COVID and the effect that the pandemic had had around the world. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=353.08000000000004s)]
*  Clearly, that came up inside the conversation. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=357.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't know if specifically the zero COVID policy was an issue of discussion, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=361.32000000000005s)]
*  but certainly COVID was on the agenda, as you might expect that it would be. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=367.24s)]
*  And our message to peaceful protesters around the world is the same and consistent. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=371.40000000000003s)]
*  People should be allowed the right to assemble and to peacefully protest policies or laws [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=377.72s)]
*  or dictates that they take issue with. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  Does the White House support their efforts to regain personal freedoms in light of these lockdowns? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=386.52000000000004s)]
*  White House supports the right of peaceful protest. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=393.08000000000004s)]
*  And then on a different topic, the State Department announced today that Russia abruptly [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=395.64000000000004s)]
*  canceled the latest rounds of arms negotiations. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=399.48s)]
*  Is the President planning to reach out to anybody about that? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=402.92s)]
*  Is there any White House reaction to that? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=408.2s)]
*  I don't have any phone calls or conversations to read out. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=410.59999999999997s)]
*  What you're talking about is the bilateral consultative commission. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=413.56s)]
*  And this is a component of the new START Treaty that was signed on to in 2010. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=417.15999999999997s)]
*  This is basically an opportunity for both sides to get together and talk about the [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=423.71999999999997s)]
*  technicalities, the formalities, the compliance mechanisms that are in place with respect to new [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=429.4s)]
*  START. This would have been the first one that we would have put in place since COVID, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=434.76s)]
*  which obviously prevented those kinds of face-to-face meetings. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=439.96s)]
*  So we very much were looking forward to starting, I suppose, to START tomorrow. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=443.47999999999996s)]
*  And we were very much looking forward to that because we [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=447.0s)]
*  continue to believe in the importance of new START. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=449.64s)]
*  We haven't received a real solid answer from the Russians as to why they postponed this. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=452.84s)]
*  We're going to be working through the embassy to try to figure out what happened here. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=462.68s)]
*  And we'd like to see it get back on the schedule as soon as possible. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=467.32s)]
*  Because it's important. It's not just important for our two nations. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=469.79999999999995s)]
*  It's important for the rest of the world. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=472.12s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=477.88s)]
*  Two questions, John. First, the niece of the Ayatollah Khomeini was arrested [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=478.84000000000003s)]
*  in Tehran recently as part of the protest march. Does the administration, having stated [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=488.52s)]
*  its support for peaceful protest, have any particular statement about her arrest? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=495.64s)]
*  We would, I think, stay very consistent, sir, that we believe in the right of peaceful protest. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=500.52s)]
*  We have made it clear that we stand with particularly—it's largely Iranian women, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=505.96s)]
*  but it's obviously beyond that—but particularly their concerns about the dictates that have [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=512.68s)]
*  affected their lives personally. And we'll continue to do whatever we can to not only [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=519.0s)]
*  support their right of protest, but to hold the regime accountable for the way it's treating its [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=524.28s)]
*  people. And along the same lines, is the administration going to put out a statement [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=527.8s)]
*  to the military junta in Burma about the published reports of the incarceration [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=532.84s)]
*  and keeping in communicado the former leader Aung San Suu Kyi? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=540.04s)]
*  I don't have a preview of some sort of statement to read out to you today. We've been very clear [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=545.4s)]
*  about our concerns over the military's domination there and their practice in their policies, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=550.12s)]
*  particularly the way they treat political prisoners. But I don't have a statement for [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=558.12s)]
*  you today about that particular issue. On China, is it the U.S.'s assessment that [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=562.12s)]
*  these protests we've seen are widespread, or are they perhaps more isolated incidents [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=568.6s)]
*  that are being amplified by social media? I don't think that we know a whole lot more [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=574.6s)]
*  about the geographic location, size, scale, and scope of them than what you're learning as well [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=580.6s)]
*  through social media and through traditional media. It's not like we have, I think, a finer [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=588.04s)]
*  sense of insight than what's already out there in the public sphere. So I don't have a sense of that. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=594.8399999999999s)]
*  In that realm, the statement that was issued earlier today didn't include any explicit calls [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=601.8s)]
*  for China to stop detaining and harming protesters and journalists. Why not? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=608.36s)]
*  We're watching this closely, as you might expect we would. And again, we continue to stand up and [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=613.4s)]
*  support the right of peaceful protest. And I think we're going to watch this closely and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=618.84s)]
*  we'll see where things go. Can I ask you a quick one on Iran? The U.S. men's national soccer team [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=622.92s)]
*  has thrown up an image of the old flag before then, including the Islamic Republic symbol. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=629.88s)]
*  Does the White House have any comment on that decision? No, actually we don't. And this isn't [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=638.6s)]
*  the kind of thing that the White House would comment on. USA Soccer is a private entity and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=643.96s)]
*  they make their own decisions about those kinds of things. And we wouldn't comment on that. We [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=648.92s)]
*  wish them all the best tomorrow. The team had said it changed the flag after consultations [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=654.04s)]
*  with various entities afterward. Are you aware of anyone in the U.S. government speaking to the team? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=660.28s)]
*  I'm not aware of any conversations by anybody in the U.S. government that had anything to do with [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=664.52s)]
*  their decision either to post that image previously and then to take it down and replace it. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=668.6s)]
*  On China again, John, is it the U.S.'s assessment that there's any sort of risk to the U.S. economy [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=678.12s)]
*  or the U.S. supply chain because of the protests? We don't see any particular impact right now to [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=686.76s)]
*  the supply chain as a result of these protests. And then on the vaccines, is the U.S. offered any [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=693.96s)]
*  U.S.-made vaccines, coronavirus vaccines, to China, the mRNA vaccines? We have not offered any to China [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=698.9200000000001s)]
*  at this time. As you know, we are the largest supplier of COVID vaccines around the world [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  and we have not received any requests or any interest by China to receive our vaccines. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=711.1600000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you, John. Again on China, you just noted that you're watching as [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=716.84s)]
*  closely as we might expect. Could you give us a sense of how much the president is engaging with [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=722.52s)]
*  this issue? Is he watching it personally, you know, getting updated more than on maybe some other [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=727.64s)]
*  things? The president is staying briefed on what's going on inside China. Yes. Closely briefed on this? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=732.6s)]
*  I've never been in the room where he wasn't like closely briefed. I mean, yeah, he's staying [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=742.92s)]
*  atop on what's going on. He's monitoring this. We all are. So yes, the president is certainly [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=748.92s)]
*  staying mindful of the protest activity. Thanks, Kareem. Thank you, John. You know, I sort of assume [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=754.5999999999999s)]
*  that the United States supports peaceful protest around the world. That, with all due respect, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=762.76s)]
*  doesn't strike, I would think, most people as a novel position. The question is... Well, I'm glad [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=767.7199999999999s)]
*  that it's not a novel position. It's exactly where we should be. But the president has explicitly [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=773.16s)]
*  drawn a contrast between autocracy and democracy here and also abroad. Isn't this a moment, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=778.36s)]
*  obviously without getting into some sort of grand conflict, to sort of assert the rights of people [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=786.2s)]
*  advocating for freedom and democracy more forcefully than perhaps we have? This is, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=794.36s)]
*  I think, a moment to reassert what we believe in when it comes to free assembly and [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=801.88s)]
*  peaceful protest. And we've done that. And we'll continue to do that, whether it's [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=810.0400000000001s)]
*  people protesting in Iran or China or anywhere else around the world. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=815.08s)]
*  Nothing's changed about the president's firm belief in the power of democracy and democratic [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=819.1600000000001s)]
*  institutions and how important that is. But this is really a moment to put it back into year words. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=823.48s)]
*  This is a moment for the Chinese people and the Chinese government to speak to. We have [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=829.96s)]
*  been nothing but clear and consistent, and I think you'll see that going forward. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=835.32s)]
*  So, just to follow up, John, on the China issue, why is the White House's line that everybody has [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=839.4000000000001s)]
*  the right to peacefully protest and not the US thinks it's bad to lock people up in their houses [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=845.64s)]
*  to stop COVID? We've made it clear, Peter, that a lockdown is not a policy that [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=851.4000000000001s)]
*  we're going to support here. We've come a long way over these last three years, hard to believe [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=860.52s)]
*  three years, in terms of treating COVID and preventing COVID. So we've said a lockdown is [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=865.64s)]
*  not a policy that we support here. But obviously there are people in China that have concerns about [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=872.12s)]
*  that, and they're protesting that, and we believe they should be able to do that peacefully. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=879.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay. And on the sanctions relief for Venezuela, why is it that President Biden would rather let [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=882.52s)]
*  US companies drill for oil in Venezuela than here in the US? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=888.84s)]
*  That's not an accurate take on the President's view. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=893.88s)]
*  Earlier this month he said no more drilling. There is no more drilling. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=897.8s)]
*  The President has issued 9,000 permits for drilling on US federal lands, Peter, 9,000 of [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=901.48s)]
*  them being unused. There are plenty of opportunities for oil and gas companies to drill here in the [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=907.64s)]
*  United States. I'll let Chevron speak for this particular issue of sanctions relief, but our [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=912.36s)]
*  expectation is it won't be a lot of oil coming out of there. It'll have to be shipped to the [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=917.08s)]
*  United States. Does the President think there's some benefit to the climate to drill oil in [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=920.6800000000001s)]
*  Venezuela and not here? It has nothing to do with a benefit to the climate here. Again, there are 9,000 [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=926.2800000000001s)]
*  unused permits here in the United States on federal land that oil and gas companies can and [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=931.96s)]
*  should take advantage of. 9,000. And we're talking about one there in Venezuela. Now look, it remains [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=936.2800000000001s)]
*  to be seen how much will get drilled down there. It'll be up to Chevron to decide that, Peter. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=943.96s)]
*  But as a function of the sanction itself, that oil, whatever product is drilled, has to come to the [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=951.1600000000001s)]
*  United States. One more on China. How concerned is the President that China's zero COVID strategy, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=958.76s)]
*  that these restrictions may be inhibiting the economic recovery globally and here at home? [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=966.12s)]
*  The President believes, and he's said this many times, I mean COVID absolutely has had an impact [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=971.72s)]
*  on the global economy. Certainly it's had an impact on supply chains and resources around the world. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=976.36s)]
*  And that's why the President wants to move the United States as quickly and as efficiently as [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=983.8s)]
*  we can through COVID so that even our economy can get more on track than it already is becoming now. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=990.1999999999999s)]
*  So, I mean, it is having a global effect. But what is also having a very acute, significant global [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=999.0s)]
*  impact on the economy is the war in Ukraine. And that's why we're trying to go after a price cap [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1005.4s)]
*  on Russian oil. That's why we're trying to give Ukraine the tools and capabilities they need to [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1011.0s)]
*  succeed on the battlefield so that this war can end, can end in a way in which Ukraine can be whole [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1015.0799999999999s)]
*  and sovereign and free. So there's a lot of impacts on the global economy. It's not just about COVID. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1021.88s)]
*  But beyond just COVID generally, does he think that China's zero COVID strategy, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1027.3200000000002s)]
*  that these restrictions are inhibiting the economic recovery? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1031.3200000000002s)]
*  The President recognizes that in many countries around the world, COVID is still an issue. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1034.3600000000001s)]
*  And certainly to the degree that it inhibits a country's ability to conduct commerce, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1041.24s)]
*  it's having an impact on the world. And China is a huge economic competitor out there. But I [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1048.1200000000001s)]
*  wouldn't get into parsing the dollar figure effect here of the remaining challenge of COVID [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1055.56s)]
*  in China. But clearly China as a major economic player and China still struggling with COVID, [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1062.84s)]
*  there's obviously an impact on the economy. And just one more on Paul Whelan. His brother [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1070.2s)]
*  said he missed a scheduled phone call home to his family on Thursday, which they say is incredibly [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1075.24s)]
*  unusual for him to miss a call, especially on a holiday like that. How concerned are you about [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1080.84s)]
*  this silence? Have you received any information on his condition? And just can you give us any [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1086.12s)]
*  update on any progress that we're making? I'm afraid I don't have an update for you. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1090.36s)]
*  This is the first I've heard that there was a phone call that was missed. So why don't you [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1093.0s)]
*  let me take that back and see if we can find out something for you. I don't want to just speculate [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1096.4399999999998s)]
*  up here. Well, obviously we're deeply concerned about him and Brittany Greiner and all Americans [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1100.6s)]
*  wrongfully detained overseas. But let me take that question. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1105.88s)]
*  Thank you. Two quick questions, one on China and then on Ukraine. I'm wondering what is the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1111.24s)]
*  president's reaction when he hears protesters in China chant freedom or Xi Jinping step down? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1118.0400000000002s)]
*  The president's not going to speak for protesters around the world. They're speaking for themselves. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1125.4s)]
*  So there's no reaction? These protesters are speaking for themselves. What we are doing [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1131.0800000000002s)]
*  is making it clear that we support the right of peaceful protest. And then my follow up, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1135.72s)]
*  is the backlog of arm shipments to Taiwan a result of our stepped up efforts to [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1141.32s)]
*  send arms to Ukraine? What I can tell you is that we are constantly balancing, as we must, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1149.64s)]
*  our own inventories, the inventories of our allies and partners, and people that we do conduct arm [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1156.92s)]
*  sales with, as well as, of course, the inventory that the Ukrainian Armed Forces need to fight the [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1162.36s)]
*  Russian aggression. And it's a balancing act. And with every single decision by the president to [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1168.9199999999998s)]
*  draw down DOD stocks, he gets an assessment from the Pentagon about whether that's going to affect [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1175.6399999999999s)]
*  our readiness. And we're in constant touch with, again, allies and partners about their readiness [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1181.32s)]
*  needs because many of them are reliant on US systems. And of course, that includes Taiwan. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1185.4s)]
*  The president just signed out, what, a month or so ago, another billion dollars of Taiwan arm sales. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1193.3200000000002s)]
*  And of course, we're going to continue to look at what the next iteration of that needs to look like [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1198.92s)]
*  and when that would occur. But we take very seriously our responsibility to help provide Taiwan the [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1203.8000000000002s)]
*  self-defense capabilities that it needs. That's in accordance with law and policy, and that's not [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1208.92s)]
*  going to change. But in terms of those shipments actually going out the door to Taiwan currently, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1214.04s)]
*  is there a backlog when it comes to those arms being shipped? I'm not going to get into a public [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1218.12s)]
*  podium talking about inventory stocks of any system anywhere. That just is not a good idea for [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1223.3999999999999s)]
*  us to do, certainly not from the podium. We watch it very closely. We make sure that our [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1229.96s)]
*  readiness can be preserved, as well as the readiness of our allies and partners. But look, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1235.08s)]
*  has all the provisions to Ukraine, has that caused an effort inside the administration to make sure [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1239.8s)]
*  that we are judiciously monitoring stocks and inventories and working with the defense industry [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1246.84s)]
*  to plus them up and to make sure that those supply chains are still flowing? Absolutely. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1253.08s)]
*  Of course we are. But it's a balance we strike every day. [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1258.52s)]
*  Thanks, sir. Way in the back. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1260.84s)]
*  Thanks, John. Thanks, Ken. John, regarding Turkey, many are skeptical regarding the Turkish claims [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1263.1599999999999s)]
*  that the PKK was behind the explosion in Istanbul. And now they are using this as a justification [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1272.28s)]
*  for a ground operation in Syria. Did the US ask for an evidence or did you offer help for [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1280.28s)]
*  the investigation? Do you see this as a proper justification for a ground operation in Syria? [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1287.24s)]
*  I don't believe we've offered anything to help with the investigation. And we're not in a position [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1294.76s)]
*  to say specifically who was responsible. We condemned the violence at the time. We condemn [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1304.6s)]
*  it today. And as I've said as recently as a week or so ago, we do need to remember that Turkey [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1310.6s)]
*  continues to fall victim to terrorist attacks, whether it's near that border or elsewhere [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1317.64s)]
*  inside the country. And they have a right to defend themselves and their citizens against [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1324.6000000000001s)]
*  attacks. Now what we've said additionally is that we want to see the tensions de-escalate here. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1332.76s)]
*  And we don't want to see any actions that, A, lead to the potential of additional casualties, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1339.3200000000002s)]
*  particularly civilian casualties, and B, do anything that would harm our efforts to continue [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1348.1200000000001s)]
*  to work with our Syrian counterparts against ISIS, which remains a viable, credible threat [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1355.48s)]
*  inside Iraq and Syria. And we got to keep the pressure on them. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1362.1200000000001s)]
*  But is this a green light for Erdogan to go inside Syria? When you say they have the right [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1365.8s)]
*  to defend themselves? They do have the right to defend themselves. They have suffered [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1372.84s)]
*  terrorist attacks. But we don't want to see actions, particularly inside Syria, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1378.92s)]
*  that are going to lead to potential for more casualties, more loss of innocent life, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1385.88s)]
*  and any diminution of our efforts, a distraction away from our efforts, because we have troops in [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1391.32s)]
*  Syria to go after ISIS. The other thing I'd mention is we also don't want to see any actions [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1397.08s)]
*  inside Syria by Turkey or anyone else that could put American lives at risk, because there are [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1404.44s)]
*  Americans on the ground and they're helping the SDF. There are some concrete steps moving the [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1411.08s)]
*  relationship forward in terms of bilateral basis after the meeting between President Biden and [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1419.88s)]
*  Xi. Is there any concern or will those steps have any effect on how the U.S. responds to any Chinese [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1424.3600000000001s)]
*  response to the protests that are currently taking place? I think we're going to have to watch this [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1432.1200000000001s)]
*  going forward, Phil. What I can tell you is, as you and I are talking today, there's been no change [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1435.88s)]
*  our desire to continue to see these channels of communication stay open. And we were heartened [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1443.72s)]
*  coming away from the G20 that both leaders were able to agree on getting some of these working [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1449.32s)]
*  level discussions back open. And so we're still in that mode, Phil, where we want to continue to [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1455.1599999999999s)]
*  get those discussions back up in play. And as for whether or not there'll be an impact from the [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1460.4399999999998s)]
*  protests, we're just going to have to, I think we're just, as I said, we're going to watch this and [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1468.12s)]
*  see where it goes. One more quick one. Apology screen. What kind of the crunch time for the [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1471.6399999999999s)]
*  price cap you mentioned a few minutes ago? Yeah. Is there a sense inside the White House right now [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1475.96s)]
*  that the president or the team will need to have more of a public posture in terms of trying to [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1480.1200000000001s)]
*  get this across the finish line? I know it's kind of an EU level issue right now. Yeah, I don't think [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1486.28s)]
*  we're at that point right now where we feel there's some sort of inordinate pressure to [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1491.4s)]
*  be more public about them. We already have been, I think we've been very public about it, [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1496.2s)]
*  or that we need to smash down on the accelerator here. The discussions are going well, we think, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1501.08s)]
*  and we strongly believe that a price cap is a good approach, the right approach to limit [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1509.8799999999999s)]
*  Mr. Putin's ability to profiteer off this war. And our EU colleagues are working through the [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1517.48s)]
*  modalities they're at right now, how that would be implemented, what level it's going to be at. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1522.92s)]
*  We think those discussions are going on in a pretty robust fashion, so I don't think we believe [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1527.24s)]
*  there's a pressure on us right now to get more involved than we already are. Thanks. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1531.0s)]
*  John, I want to try to get your response to a letter that was sent by the leadership of five [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1536.1200000000001s)]
*  news organizations to the administration. One of those news organizations is the New York Times. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1539.3200000000002s)]
*  These organizations worked with Julian Assange prior to the publication of classified cables [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1543.64s)]
*  by WikiLeaks, and they're asking that the administration drop the Espionage Act charge [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1547.96s)]
*  that was put forward against Assange by the Trump administration. Generally, what's the White House's [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1552.3600000000001s)]
*  response to that request? And I'll start there and then I'll ask you a follow-up. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1556.44s)]
*  Yeah, we're aware of it, and we would refer you to the Justice Department. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1559.8s)]
*  All right. Anticipating that answer, what is your assessment, or what is the National Security [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1563.56s)]
*  Council's assessment of the harm that was done by the WikiLeaks leak in 2012? That would inform [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1567.96s)]
*  any decision by the Justice Department. I think if you go back and look at how [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1573.64s)]
*  the administration responded in 2012, and of course, President Biden was then vice president [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1577.96s)]
*  at the time, we would maintain what we said at the time, what was said at the time, that those [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1583.72s)]
*  leaks, those revelations in the public sphere were damaging to U.S. national security. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1595.48s)]
*  Yeah, I just wanted to ask, the head of NATO is warning that essentially Vladimir Putin is using [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1603.32s)]
*  winter as a weapon of war against Ukraine. What specifically is the United States doing in [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1610.92s)]
*  conjunction with its partners and allies to counter that, given the continued attacks on the energy grid? [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1615.96s)]
*  So you're referring to his targeting of civilian infrastructure. Yeah, so I mean, this is a guy [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1623.0s)]
*  who's used food as a weapon, he's used fear as a weapon, and as the Secretary General of NATO said, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1628.04s)]
*  he's using the coming cold weather here to basically try to bring the Ukrainian people [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1639.72s)]
*  to their knees. Let me take a look at what he's hitting. It's almost all civilian infrastructure, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1645.88s)]
*  and it's largely, as you pointed out, it's energy, it's water, it's the kind of resources that [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1652.6000000000001s)]
*  people need as they get ready to brace for what will no doubt be a cold winter. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1658.04s)]
*  And so what we're doing is a couple of things. First of all, we're still going to continue to [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1663.48s)]
*  provide the Ukrainian Armed Forces with the tools, weapons, the capabilities, the training that they [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1671.0s)]
*  need so that they can be successful on the battlefield. And they have been very successful [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1675.48s)]
*  in just the last few weeks. Secondly, we're working with allies and partners around the world, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1681.32s)]
*  and certainly working inside the various agencies of this administration to get spare parts, [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1686.76s)]
*  equipment, transformers, the kinds of material they'll need to get some of these systems and [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1694.68s)]
*  networks back up and running and get the power turned back on in much of Ukraine, as well as, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1701.08s)]
*  of course, water resources. So we're working on that very, very hard, again, with allies and [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1706.76s)]
*  partners. Some of the material will no doubt come from the United States. But we also recognize that [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1711.16s)]
*  their grid is based on infrastructure that is uniquely European. And so we're working with, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1718.0400000000002s)]
*  again, allies and partners in the region as well to see what they can do to get more in there, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1726.2s)]
*  to keep the lights on and the water running. But it's despicable. It's absolutely despicable [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1731.64s)]
*  what he is doing in these last few weeks. Not that it hasn't been despicable before, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1737.4s)]
*  but you hit exactly on the issue that these targets are largely civilian, and it's designed [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1742.1200000000001s)]
*  for one reason, and that's to try to bring the Ukrainian people to their knees, because he can't [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1749.48s)]
*  bring the Ukrainian armed forces to its knees. And you would think that now going into, I guess it's [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1753.5600000000002s)]
*  eight months now, which is hard to believe, actually going into our ninth month here, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1759.0800000000002s)]
*  that he would have learned, he, Putin, would have learned a while ago that you just can't bring the [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1762.92s)]
*  Ukrainian people to their knees. Two more. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1770.44s)]
*  We've said that we believe Kim could conduct a nuclear test at any time. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1783.96s)]
*  I certainly can't speak to the parenting skills of Kim Jong-un. I'm afraid I don't have anything for you. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1792.92s)]
*  In all seriousness, the man continues to advance military capabilities that continue to [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1808.44s)]
*  destabilize the region, not just the peninsula, but the region. And we're taking this seriously, [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1816.3600000000001s)]
*  which is why we're improving our intelligence capabilities there, collection capabilities in [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1821.48s)]
*  the regions, why we're working so hard with Japan and South Korea. Bilaterally and trilaterally, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1825.48s)]
*  the president had a chance to meet with both leaders while we were at the G20 to advance [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1830.28s)]
*  our own defense capabilities and our own defense needs. People sometimes forget, I've said it along, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1835.48s)]
*  you guys probably roll your eyes when I say this because I've said it before, but five of our seven [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1840.3600000000001s)]
*  treaty alliances, since we started the briefing talking about alliances, five of seven are in [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1843.64s)]
*  the Indo-Pacific. And we take them seriously because they put on us very significant security [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1849.0s)]
*  commitments to help with the defense of Japan and South Korea respectively in this case. And we take [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1855.16s)]
*  that seriously, which means we got to make sure we're ready for the kinds of capabilities that [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1860.04s)]
*  he clearly is so interested in continuing to pursue. Thanks, Brian. Thanks, John. There have [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1864.36s)]
*  been reports about the penal colony that Brittany Greiner is being held, indicating that she [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1871.88s)]
*  potentially is exposed to forced labor and homophobia and racism. Is there any update [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1878.36s)]
*  about her physical and mental health? And I know CIA Director Burns did meet with his counterpart [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1884.36s)]
*  in Russia. Are there any plans to have another meeting between officials between US and Russia [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1891.0s)]
*  to specifically discuss this ongoing negotiation to get her home? Great questions, both of them. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1897.1599999999999s)]
*  On the second one, we continue to have ongoing conversations with Russian officials [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1903.88s)]
*  about Brittany's release as well as Mr. Whelan's and trying to get them home to their families [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1912.04s)]
*  where they belong. I can assure you that those conversations are ongoing and we want them both [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1918.6000000000001s)]
*  home as fast as possible and this administration is going to stay committed to that task. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1926.44s)]
*  On her condition, I think you can understand for privacy reasons. I'm not going to get into [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1931.24s)]
*  much detail about her physical health. I wouldn't do that. I can just tell you that we're taking [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1936.76s)]
*  that very seriously as well, knowing where she is and what penal colonies are designed to do. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1943.3200000000002s)]
*  And we're trying to make sure we have as much access and information about her condition [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1949.88s)]
*  as possible. Sometimes that's done more through her representatives than it is [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1957.08s)]
*  from our diplomatic presence just because of the modalities of it, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1964.6799999999998s)]
*  but we're doing the best we can to stay on top of it as much as we can. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1968.36s)]
*  John, will you share any update on whether President Biden will accept the invitation [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1972.4399999999998s)]
*  of Mexican President Lucas Obrador to attend the Three Amigos Summit in Mexico City? I know that [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1976.84s)]
*  had been talked about as potentially scheduled for December, now maybe pushed back to January [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1982.6s)]
*  with the North American Leaders Summit. The President is looking forward to being able to [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1987.32s)]
*  have that meeting, but we don't have a date yet or anything to say on the schedule. Nothing to [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1994.1999999999998s)]
*  confirm on the schedule right now, but he's looking forward to the discussion. Absolutely. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=1999.9599999999998s)]
*  All right. Thank you. Thanks, guys. Happy late Thanksgiving to you. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2004.9199999999998s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2009.8799999999999s)]
*  Okay. Before we dive into questions, just to have a couple things, a few updates at the top to share [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2011.56s)]
*  with all of you. As you know, President Biden committed to doing everything within his power [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2016.76s)]
*  to address Putin's price hike at the pump. Today, gas prices have returned to the levels they were [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2022.52s)]
*  prior to Putin's invasion of Ukraine. As the chart behind me shows, the national average is $3.55 [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2028.76s)]
*  per gallon, down over $1.45 per gallon from the June peak. The most common price is $2.99 [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2037.72s)]
*  per gallon. That's saving American families with two cars, about $160 per month on average. This [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2046.36s)]
*  is important breathing room for American families and meets a key commitment the President made to [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2056.12s)]
*  them. So it's no accident either on a couple of things. President Biden has been releasing oil [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2061.96s)]
*  from the reserve, as you know, which was a historic action that this President took. He called on [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2067.0s)]
*  international partners to release oil as well, and he's been calling on oil and gas companies [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2072.04s)]
*  to pass on their savings to consumers at the pump. The President's actions have helped bring [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2077.96s)]
*  prices down for families, and he will continue to do everything possible to bring prices down even [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2084.6s)]
*  further. Earlier today, the President signed a presidential memorandum on promoting accountability [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2091.7200000000003s)]
*  for conflict-related sexual violence to strengthen the U.S. government's effort to combat rape as a [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2098.68s)]
*  weapon of war. This presidential memorandum directs the State Department, Treasury Department, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2105.7999999999997s)]
*  and other federal agencies to leverage sanctions, authorities, assistance, restrictions, and other [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2111.24s)]
*  tools to promote accountability for perpetrators of conflict-related sexual violence. With this [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2117.08s)]
*  executive action, U.S. departments and agency are for the first time ever being directed to ensure [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2123.96s)]
*  equal consideration of acts of conflict-related sexual violence when identifying targets and [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2130.76s)]
*  preparing designations for potential sanctions. Under President Biden's leadership, the United [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2137.64s)]
*  States will continue leading efforts to rally other nations and international organizations to [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2143.56s)]
*  prevent and promote accountability for acts of conflict-related sexual violence. Today's action is [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2149.56s)]
*  part of the President's broader commitment to work to address all forms of gender-based violence. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2157.16s)]
*  Now finally, today President Biden met with three U.S. winners of the 2022 Nobel Prize, [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2164.92s)]
*  Dr. Caroline Bertosi, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Dr. John Clauser, who won the Nobel Prize [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2172.2799999999997s)]
*  in Physics, and Dr. Douglas Diamond, who won the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences. The President is [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2181.56s)]
*  restarting an important tradition that just like he does for winning sports teams, as you have seen [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2188.2799999999997s)]
*  him do in the past 20 months or so, the President meets with U.S. winners of the Nobel Prize. Their [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2195.0s)]
*  achievements show how taking on the biggest questions can establish new fields of inquiry, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2202.92s)]
*  promote technology, innovation, and expand the boundaries of what is possible. Their work is a [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2209.16s)]
*  reminder of why President often says that the America can be defined by one word, and you all [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2215.24s)]
*  know that word that he uses is possibilities. With that, I'm going to go out of school for a [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2221.16s)]
*  second, and I know there's a young reporter in the room who would like to ask a question. Eva? Eva [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2227.56s)]
*  Shapiro? Sharapich. Oh, pardon me. Where are you from? Austin, Texas, and you are part of the kids [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2235.16s)]
*  scoop? Oh, right. Well, welcome to the briefing room. It's great to have you, and you could, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2243.72s)]
*  you're going to trump AP, and I'll take your first question. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2249.56s)]
*  Given the situation in Iran with protesting, what are we going to do, or what can we do? [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2255.4s)]
*  So that's an excellent question, and an important question to ask, and we have answered this question [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2263.56s)]
*  multiple times here at this podium, and the President spoke to this when he was in the [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2269.72s)]
*  halls of the United Nations not too long ago in September, and he said, we stand with the brave [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2277.32s)]
*  citizens and the brave women of Iran who right now are demonstrating to secure their basic rights. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2283.88s)]
*  There's a lot that we can do and a lot that we are doing to support those brave citizens, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2291.2400000000002s)]
*  again, of Iran, those brave protesters. We're taking steps both on our own as the United States [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2296.6800000000003s)]
*  and also in partnership with other countries just around the world, and including organizations like [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2303.64s)]
*  the United Nations, as I mentioned when the President first made his comments about what [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2309.3199999999997s)]
*  we were seeing in Iran from the civilians. But let me just give you a couple of examples. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2314.44s)]
*  We're using economic tools like sanctions against Iranian officials. We supported the UN Human Rights [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2319.0s)]
*  Council's vote to create a fact-finding mission to investigate human rights abuses in Iran, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2325.3199999999997s)]
*  which was really historic, something that we had not seen. So we are working with civil society [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2331.7200000000003s)]
*  organizations to make sure Iran is removed from a United Nations body focused on women called the [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2337.5600000000004s)]
*  UN Commission on the Status of Women. We have expressed support for the joint statement by [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2344.36s)]
*  women foreign ministers on Iran, and we are speaking out over and over again and raising [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2350.0400000000004s)]
*  awareness and making sure that those brave women and citizens are lifted up as they are really [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2357.56s)]
*  fighting for their basic rights. But thank you so much for your question. I really appreciate you. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2365.08s)]
*  And again, welcome to the briefing room. Hopefully you come back. All right, go ahead. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2369.56s)]
*  Thanks again, and welcome to the briefing room. Two and a half weeks ago, the President held [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2374.2s)]
*  this press conference after the midterm results he said he'd be inviting congressional leadership [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2379.08s)]
*  both parties over the White House after his trip to the G20. Has that invite gone out and when is [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2383.16s)]
*  that meeting going to take place? So as you know, Congress has just returned, so the President is [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2391.64s)]
*  looking forward to talking to, speaking with, to Democratic and Republican leadership. I don't have [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2395.48s)]
*  anything to preview for you at this time on a date on when that will happen, but he is, this is [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2403.24s)]
*  something that he is indeed looking forward to, and we will make that happen as soon as we can. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2408.2s)]
*  Today is this deadline for counties to certify election results in a number of states, [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2413.48s)]
*  including Arizona, where at least one county has refused to certify the results of the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2417.8799999999997s)]
*  midterm elections from a couple weeks ago, citing the conduct of the election in another county, [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2422.7599999999998s)]
*  Maricopa County. Does the White House, is the White House monitoring sort of state level and [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2428.44s)]
*  local county level efforts to sort of overturn election results or not certify election results [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2434.12s)]
*  does the President have any response? So very good question. I don't have anything to share on [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2439.24s)]
*  if we're monitoring anything specific or in particular. I'm sure that's something that DNC [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2444.12s)]
*  is doing and other committees are clearly focusing on on those particulars very closely. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2449.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, but we've been very clear on the sacred right to vote and how, you know, and how it's [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2456.6s)]
*  important that the American people feel like their vote will be counted and that, and he has [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2462.84s)]
*  denounced the election deniers that we have heard from on the other side and he has called that out [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2468.6000000000004s)]
*  and he has every confident in our electoral system. And lastly, we know those real negotiations are, [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2475.56s)]
*  seem to be nearing a pass. There's a report in the Washington Post the President plans to [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2484.36s)]
*  ask Congress to step in and either extend the Kulidov period of their talks or take some other [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2489.7999999999997s)]
*  measures to try to prevent a potentially devastating shutdown of the rail system in the next couple of [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2494.6s)]
*  weeks. Does he confirm the President does plan to ask Congress to step in and take action here? [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2499.08s)]
*  Well, I don't have anything right now at this time to announce or preview on any announcement [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2503.56s)]
*  that the President's going to make. Once he is ready to make that announcement, certainly he, [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2508.8399999999997s)]
*  we will let you know or make an announcement of any kind related to this. We will clearly share [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2512.7599999999998s)]
*  that with all of you. I do want to say a couple of things, which is really important as we look [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2519.3199999999997s)]
*  at what's currently happening. Look, from the beginning, the President has been very clear. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2523.72s)]
*  Shutdown is unacceptable because of the impact that it would have on jobs and families and farms and [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2527.3199999999997s)]
*  businesses and communities just across the country. The President is directly involved in the process [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2533.8799999999997s)]
*  and has been engaged with his team and also has had conversation with members of Congress on this [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2539.08s)]
*  particular issue in case resolving the issue falls to them as it has 18 times in the last 60 years, [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2545.16s)]
*  as you know. I know you guys are following this closely. And in addition to President's involvement, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2555.64s)]
*  Secretary Walsh has been in contact with rail workers, the unions there. He has been in direct [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2561.08s)]
*  contact with them. Secretary Buttigieg has been in contact with rail companies. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2568.68s)]
*  Secretary Vilsack has engaged agriculture and industry stakeholders as well. This has been [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2572.7599999999998s)]
*  very much not just the President, but clearly the three Secretaries that I just mentioned and his [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2579.32s)]
*  administration. A majority of unions, as you all know, have voted to ratify the temporary agreement [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2584.04s)]
*  that's eight out of 12. There are 12 unions involved. The best option that we believe, [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2591.4s)]
*  that the President believes, is still for the parties to resolve this themselves. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2596.44s)]
*  The RALs resolve this themselves and to do this really in short order. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2599.64s)]
*  Members of the Democratic National Committee are meeting here in Washington later this week to talk [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2606.52s)]
*  about the potential calendar for the party's presidential nomination process in 2024. They're [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2610.7599999999998s)]
*  doing this in essence at the behest of the President who has signaled that he's not a huge fan of Iowa [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2618.04s)]
*  going first given the lack of diversity in that state. Can you say whether he intends to weigh in [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2623.72s)]
*  on this issue as or before they meet or if he indeed believes that Iowa should lose its first [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2630.6s)]
*  in the nation status? Look, this is not something that I'm going to speak to from here. This is [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2637.24s)]
*  something that the Democratic National Committee, as you know, is that committee that you're speaking [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2642.3599999999997s)]
*  of is out of the DNC and so I would refer you to them specifically. I don't have anything else to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2647.64s)]
*  preview or to share about any comments or statements that the President may make on this particular [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2654.12s)]
*  issue but again from here I'm not going to comment on this. I would refer you to the DNC. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2659.56s)]
*  Are there any plans for the President to go to Georgia in the final days of the Senate runoff? [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2668.3599999999997s)]
*  So I've been asked this question before about what the President could potentially be doing [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2673.08s)]
*  for the Georgia runoff. I have to be careful because it is an existing race that is happening [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2678.84s)]
*  and so I cannot, I am covered by the Hatch Act so can't speak specifically to this but what I can [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2686.04s)]
*  say and I've said this before, the President is willing to do whatever is needed of him by [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2691.4s)]
*  Senator Warnock. I don't have anything else to preview from here. So does that mean that the [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2697.48s)]
*  ask hasn't been made from Senator Warnock? I really, I just, I don't want to dive into request [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2702.04s)]
*  or ask that's something that we didn't do during the midterms the past several months so certainly [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2708.2s)]
*  not going to start now. What I can say I don't have anything to preview for you at this time [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2712.84s)]
*  or to announce but again the President is willing to do whatever is asked of him. The Boston Globe [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2718.12s)]
*  is reporting that the President is going to be in Boston on Friday for a fundraiser. Can you confirm [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2724.2s)]
*  that trip and then also they note that that day the Royals will be in Boston as well for the Earth [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2729.56s)]
*  Shop Prize? Is there potentially going to be an overlap or meeting? So we've heard about that. This [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2734.6s)]
*  is the the Prince of Wales is going to be. So I don't have anything to share on the President's [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2739.32s)]
*  travels for any traveling announcement to make for Friday or any future date after tomorrow. As [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2747.64s)]
*  you all know he's he'll be going to Michigan. Once we have something to share certainly we will share [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2756.12s)]
*  that and as as far as the the Royals being in town I don't have anything to preview as well. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2760.12s)]
*  Finally the President said he did a part of his annual physical while he was talking about [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2765.72s)]
*  answering a question about this specifically in Nantucket and he said he would do the rest [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2770.92s)]
*  before the end of the year. What did he mean by that and then will be here you'd be going to Walter [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2774.52s)]
*  Reed as he did last year? That's a good question. I haven't, I actually have not talked to him about [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2779.08s)]
*  that. I remember him saying that over the weekend. Look I was asked this question just at the last [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2783.48s)]
*  briefing you know the President is in good health and maintains an active lifestyle. You see him on [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2789.48s)]
*  a almost on a regular basis yourselves and you can see he always says watch me. He will have a [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2795.08s)]
*  physical in the upcoming months and the results will be certainly released as the same way it was [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2800.6s)]
*  last year in a very transparent way and we will be sharing with that with all of you as soon as [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2806.36s)]
*  as soon as we have it. Go ahead Stephen. Thanks just to go back to the rail labor dispute. What [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2812.2s)]
*  would drive the President to seek congressional resolution here? Look I'm not going to legislate [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2816.52s)]
*  from here. What I can say is we have been in regular communication with Congress for the past [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2821.64s)]
*  several months but certainly not going to legislate or or lay out a process from here. I'm going to [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2828.4399999999996s)]
*  ask you this in 1992 the last time Congress intervened to prevent a labor rail shutdown [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2835.08s)]
*  Joe Biden was one of six senators and only six to say that the Congress should not intervene [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2840.44s)]
*  that it's a dynamic that favors the railroads against the interests of the workers. Why would [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2846.84s)]
*  he seek congressional intervention now? Look again I can't I'm I'm when the President has made a [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2851.32s)]
*  decision on this if he makes a decision on this you'll hear directly from him. Don't have anything [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2858.6s)]
*  to share or preview at this time. As I mentioned moments ago the President has been in regular [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2863.8s)]
*  contact with members of Congress. He has been directly involved in having those conversations [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2868.68s)]
*  directly involved with his administration. I laid out what Secretary Walsh is doing with Secretary [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2873.3999999999996s)]
*  Buttigieg and Secretary Vilsack. This is something that has been a priority for this President [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2877.3999999999996s)]
*  and this administration for the past several months. Majority as I just laid out also moments [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2883.24s)]
*  ago of unions have ratified the tentative agreement. Again I'm not going to legislate from here. I'm [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2888.3599999999997s)]
*  not going to get ahead of any potential announcement but as you stated in cases like this [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2895.32s)]
*  issues falls to Congress and it has done this 18 times in the last 60 years. So again it's not [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2905.1600000000003s)]
*  unusual but I'm just not going to get into a hypothetical from here at this time. A couple [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2912.28s)]
*  questions about the lame duck agenda. The President said last week that he was going to try to ban [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2917.48s)]
*  assault weapons during this session. What does that look like? Is he making calls? Is he taking [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2922.44s)]
*  meetings on this? Is he tasked the team with working on this? And does he think that 60 votes [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2927.0s)]
*  are actually possible here? That's within reach somehow. So I'm so glad you asked the question [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2931.48s)]
*  Mary because this morning when I was in the Oval Office in a meeting with the President he actually [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2935.48s)]
*  brought this up himself because he knows how his comments were reported over the weekend. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2939.8s)]
*  And he wanted to be very clear and he said that you know he believes that it's important to keep [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2946.04s)]
*  this issue in banning assault weapons at the front of minds of Americans. He believes that [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2951.56s)]
*  it is also up to him as President of the United States to make the case for why it is critical [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2958.04s)]
*  to move forward with assault weapons ban. And so he understands what's at stake. He wants the [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2964.2799999999997s)]
*  American people to continue to understand what's at stake. We know many communities have felt this [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2971.96s)]
*  very deeply, very personally, and he also believes you know there were families this past [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2977.24s)]
*  Thanksgiving holiday who looked around their table and there were missing members of their family [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2985.0s)]
*  because of this gun violence, this horrific gun violence that we have seen as recently as this [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2990.3599999999997s)]
*  weekend, as recently as just last week. And he believes that they deserve, they deserve to, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=2996.7599999999998s)]
*  for us, for him to continue to talk about this, continue to put this out there about the importance [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3004.12s)]
*  of getting this done for American communities. But again, look, we understand it's an uphill battle. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3011.3199999999997s)]
*  We understand that this is not easy. He gets that, but doesn't mean that he's going to stop [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3017.0s)]
*  fighting for it or that he's going to stop talking about it. And one other issue, raising the debt [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3021.08s)]
*  ceiling, we've seen Republicans sort of threaten to use this as leverage to get some of their agenda [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3025.88s)]
*  items through. How much importance does the president place on raising the debt ceiling during [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3030.52s)]
*  a lame duck session? So, you know, we've been clear about this when it comes to the debt ceiling. It [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3035.8s)]
*  should not, it should not be used or never be a matter of political brinksmanship. We've been [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3042.92s)]
*  very clear about that and, you know, congressional Republicans, they passed this with the last [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3049.8s)]
*  president three times. The former president, they passed to lift the debt ceiling three times. [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3055.64s)]
*  There's no reason why this should not be happening this time around. Congress, you know, needs to [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3060.7599999999998s)]
*  take the responsibility once again to address the debt ceiling before it expires. And they need to [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3067.4s)]
*  act sooner rather than later. Look, now that Congress is back, we believe that, you know, [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3073.48s)]
*  there will be more of an urgency to get this done. And look, this is about, you know, the sooner they [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3080.2s)]
*  act, you know, this is about our economy. This will be better for our economy. So we'll have those [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3087.96s)]
*  conversations. The president, as I was asked moments ago, is going to meet with leadership [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3092.9199999999996s)]
*  from both the House and the Senate, the Democratic and Republican leadership. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3098.7599999999998s)]
*  And certainly we'll be having these conversations. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3103.48s)]
*  You just laid out for us the gas prices are back down to levels before the war. Housing [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3108.2s)]
*  prices, on the other hand, are not coming down nearly fast enough. Given the split Congress, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3116.04s)]
*  you know, we've talked about some of the difficulties of the lame duck session. I mean, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3123.32s)]
*  have you run out of options in terms of pressing down housing prices and what can you do to help [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3125.96s)]
*  people there, especially if the student debt issue doesn't go your way? Look, we are, as the [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3132.04s)]
*  president said to your last statement about the student debt relief, his relief plan, he's [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3139.32s)]
*  optimistic. He's an optimistic person. He's going to continue to fight for a plan that's going to [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3144.84s)]
*  help close to 40 million Americans across the country. And let's not forget, 90% of them are [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3150.2s)]
*  making less than $75,000 a year. That matters. That is a plan that is going to give people a [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3156.68s)]
*  little bit of breathing room. So we are confident in our legal standing, if you will. As you know, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3162.8399999999997s)]
*  it's up to the Supreme Court and we're going to continue to fight. That will not end. But to your [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3171.72s)]
*  question, look, housing affordability is a central challenge for families. We know that as you just [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3177.48s)]
*  laid that out, Andrea, and that's due to longstanding shortfall of affordable housing [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3183.48s)]
*  plus increased demand for homes during the pandemic and a reduced number of homes due to [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3188.92s)]
*  previous supply chain challenges. So the good news is this, that we are starting to see the [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3194.36s)]
*  housing market cool by a range of measures. Just a bit, several data sources now show that rent [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3199.48s)]
*  falling or rent growth easing in recent months, which should mean lower shelter inflation on [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3206.12s)]
*  months ahead. But we understand and we get it. As I just said, it's a central issue for many [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3212.92s)]
*  families, many Americans. There's more work to do and we will continue to use all of the [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3218.04s)]
*  administrative tools to make sure that we continue to give families some relief. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3225.08s)]
*  I have a question about Twitter. You know, there's a researcher at Stanford who says [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3229.88s)]
*  this is a critical moment really in terms of ensuring that Twitter does not become a [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3235.7200000000003s)]
*  vector for misinformation. I mean, are you concerned about, you know, Elon Musk says there's [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3241.72s)]
*  more and more subscribers coming online. Are you concerned about that and what tools do you have? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3249.9599999999996s)]
*  Who is it at the White House that is really keeping track of this? [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3256.8399999999997s)]
*  So look, this is something that we're certainly keeping an eye on. And look, we, you know, we have [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3261.0s)]
*  always been very clear and that when it comes to social media platforms, it is their responsibility [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3269.16s)]
*  to make sure that when it comes to misinformation, when it comes to the hate that we're seeing, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3277.3199999999997s)]
*  that they take action, that they continue to take action. Again, we're all keeping a close eye on [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3284.04s)]
*  this. We're all monitoring what's currently occurring. And we see, you know, we see it with [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3289.7999999999997s)]
*  our own eyes of what you all are reporting and just for ourselves what's happening on Twitter. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3297.24s)]
*  But again, social media companies have a responsibility to prevent their platforms [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3302.7599999999998s)]
*  from being used by any user to incite violence, especially violence directed at individual [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3307.9599999999996s)]
*  communities. As we have been seeing and the president has been very clear on calling [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3313.9599999999996s)]
*  that out. He'll continue to do that. And we're going to continue to monitor the situation. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3318.9199999999996s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3323.32s)]
*  Thanks, Karina. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3323.8s)]
*  I don't think the president has spoken to the House Republican leader since the day after the [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3324.6000000000004s)]
*  election, even though the House was called for Republican a few days later. Is that anything [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3328.52s)]
*  you do back that he may not actually be speaker of the House next Congress or how are you guys [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3332.44s)]
*  kind of working through that? [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3337.0800000000004s)]
*  No, I mean, Congress has been out. They're just coming back in. Look, the president has [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3338.28s)]
*  been really clear and he's underscored this many times that he's eager to find common ground [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3344.28s)]
*  and work across the aisle. That is something that he has done while he's been president here. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3349.16s)]
*  The Chips and Science Act, as you all know, the bipartisan infrastructure law is something that [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3354.92s)]
*  he's been he's done as well. And he has signed into law more than 200 pieces of legislation [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3360.36s)]
*  that were bipartisan. So look, he's looking forward to having those conversations with [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3366.04s)]
*  congressional Republicans. And what his focus is, and he's been very clear about this, is [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3371.32s)]
*  delivering for the American people, continuing to give them that little bit of breathing room. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3377.56s)]
*  And once we have that meeting set, we certainly will share that. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3381.64s)]
*  When it comes to the lame duck, you talk about the bipartisanship idea, he's going to be at [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3385.24s)]
*  least 10 Republicans on a government spending package if an omnibus is going to move forward. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3389.08s)]
*  Has he been given any signals by Senate Republican leadership that there will be 10 Republicans for [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3393.16s)]
*  an overarching full fiscal year deal? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3398.44s)]
*  So look, when it comes to the government funding, you know, our efforts to secure the needed [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3400.7599999999998s)]
*  government funding are in good hands with our OMB Director Shalonda Young. She is not new to this, [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3406.6s)]
*  as you know. We were able to get this done in a bipartisan fashion just last year. And so she [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3412.92s)]
*  knows how to reach across the aisle. And so we are confident that we will get this done. And, you know, [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3420.2s)]
*  we have been our Office of Ledge Affairs, the Office OMB as well has been and has had multiple [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3426.7599999999998s)]
*  calls with congressional members and staffers and also have done briefings about how important it is [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3435.64s)]
*  in reaching an agreement, a full year appropriations agreement and the dangers of passing the buck yet [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3442.92s)]
*  again. And not only that, I think you all saw just last night, the Secretary of Defense, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3450.12s)]
*  Secretary Austin, put out a letter he wrote to Congress. And he said he warned that a continuing [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3455.4s)]
*  resolution of any length would result in significant harm to the American people, military [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3461.56s)]
*  programs and our national security and our competitors. We have to remember the programs [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3467.08s)]
*  that we're talking about are not partisan programs. They are programs that's going to help [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3471.0s)]
*  American families. We're talking about education. We're talking, as I just mentioned, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3475.56s)]
*  as the Secretary said, our national security. You know, we're talking about things that really truly [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3479.64s)]
*  matter to the American people. Education, cutting edge technology, all of these things [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3485.32s)]
*  are not partisan issues. And so we should be able to get this done in a bipartisan way, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3491.96s)]
*  just like we did last year. Thanks, Kareem. You mentioned earlier about how passing an assault [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3496.76s)]
*  weapons ban would be an uphill battle, especially given the breakdown in Congress. I wonder if there [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3502.6000000000004s)]
*  are other things the President is considering, whether it's executive authority or calling on [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3507.0s)]
*  state governors to take action at the state level. What are some of the other things that [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3511.4s)]
*  the President is considering? Well, let me just first state, I get your question, but let me just [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3515.4s)]
*  first state a couple of things. Number one, this President has taken more executive action his first [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3519.56s)]
*  first year and a half on dealing with gun violence than any other President. And that shows his [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3525.88s)]
*  commitment and what he has been able to do and wanting to make sure to protect our communities. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3532.2s)]
*  And so just want to be very clear on that. And let's not forget just a couple of months ago, [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3537.88s)]
*  there was a bipartisan legislation on protecting our communities to really deal with the effects [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3542.36s)]
*  of gun violence. And so that is something that happened. That was the first time we were able [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3550.6s)]
*  to see that type of legislation in 30 years. So again, I have said this, the President is [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3555.48s)]
*  an optimist, but he also understand that it is he sees it as his responsibility to continue to make [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3561.2400000000002s)]
*  the case. I don't have anything else to preview as to any additional executive action that will be [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3567.4s)]
*  taken from here. But again, we have seen action on this during his presidency that we hadn't seen [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3572.76s)]
*  in 30 years. Question about tomorrow, the President's going to Michigan. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3581.48s)]
*  You have a preview on what he plans to say and sort of what that portends for his future travel [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3585.6400000000003s)]
*  during the lame duck and the new Congress. Yeah, I actually do. I have something to share for you [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3592.68s)]
*  all to preview. So as you just mentioned, the President is going to be going to Michigan, [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3597.96s)]
*  specifically Bay City, Michigan, to discuss the American manufacturing boom. Thanks to his [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3603.64s)]
*  economic strategy, the President will visit a new manufacturing facility recently opened by SK [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3609.16s)]
*  Siltron, which last year announced a $300 million expansion of its Michigan operations during his [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3615.0s)]
*  remarks. President Biden will highlight his economic plan. It is leading to a manufacturing [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3621.32s)]
*  boom, growing the economy and creating good paying jobs in Michigan and also just across the country [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3627.1600000000003s)]
*  as well. As you all know, the economy has created more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs, and that is [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3633.32s)]
*  10 million total jobs created under this President in his first almost two years here in the White [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3639.96s)]
*  House. He will also discuss Democrats' success in the midterm elections in Michigan, thanks to our [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3647.72s)]
*  efforts to build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out to protect democracy, as you've [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3653.24s)]
*  heard the President speak to, and protect women's reproductive health care, which is something that [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3659.08s)]
*  the President and the Vice President is committed to doing. I would expect more coming from us this [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3663.9599999999996s)]
*  evening. We usually do a background call or have some information out there for you all to just lay [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3670.7599999999998s)]
*  out exactly what you can expect from the trip. On the rail issue again, when this was the [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3676.28s)]
*  tentative agreement was announced a few months back, it sort of led, it was after what an hours [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3685.0s)]
*  long overnight meeting with all of the parties involved with the Labor Secretary. Have the talks [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3691.0s)]
*  reached that level of intensity, that level of engagement with the administration, and if not, [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3695.7200000000003s)]
*  is that a strategy we would see employed again, essentially putting all of the parties in a room [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3700.44s)]
*  overnight, however long it takes, and nobody leaves until there's a deal? No, totally appreciate [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3704.84s)]
*  the question. Look, the President has been very clear, shutdown will be unacceptable. As I mentioned, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3710.1200000000003s)]
*  Secretary Walsh has been in direct contact with the unions, the rail unions, Secretary Buttigieg [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3714.2000000000003s)]
*  has been in touch with the rail companies, and Secretary Vilsack has been in touch with the [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3719.6400000000003s)]
*  agricultural sector. So we have been in regular touch with folks, and we're continuing to do that. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3726.1200000000003s)]
*  The President has had multiple conversations, has been directly involved with his administration, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3731.72s)]
*  and also members of Congress. And so what we believe and what we will continue to say is that [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3736.68s)]
*  we think, and what should be happening in good faith, is that they should come up with a solution. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3743.9599999999996s)]
*  And majority of the unions have ratified this. You have eight out of the 12, which is important [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3750.68s)]
*  to also note. But again, this is, I'm just not going to get into any details on what else [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3757.3199999999997s)]
*  we can, other efforts that we might be taking. It's been planned or set with every representative? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3763.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't have anything to preview about convening everyone here all at once, but it matters. It [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3769.56s)]
*  matters that Secretary Walsh has been in direct contact with the rail workers. It matters that [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3775.56s)]
*  Secretary Buttigieg has been in touch with the companies, and it matters for certain that [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3779.3999999999996s)]
*  Secretary Vilsack has been in touch with the agricultural sector, and that's going to continue. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3784.12s)]
*  Those conversations will continue to happen. Again, the President has been very clear. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3789.4s)]
*  A shutdown is unacceptable. It will hurt families, communities across the country. It will hurt [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3795.4s)]
*  jobs. It will hurt farms. It will hurt businesses, and it should not be happening. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3803.0s)]
*  Good. One question. The U.S. Embassy to the Dominican Republic issued a warning [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3807.96s)]
*  to U.S. citizens about those traveling to the DR that those that are dark-skinned were being [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3817.08s)]
*  targeted, this as the Dominican Republic is doing more deportations of Haitians. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3823.8s)]
*  And so my question is, is there anything that, any response or actions from the administration [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3830.12s)]
*  in light of this warning that's come out? So when it comes to the warnings, that comes from [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3837.24s)]
*  the Secretary of State, so I would refer you to them on the specifics and the particulars [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3840.6s)]
*  of that warning and would just let them speak to it themselves. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3846.3599999999997s)]
*  Wanted to ask a quick follow-up. The President has said repeatedly that, of course, he wants to [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3852.04s)]
*  ban assault weapons, but on Thanksgiving when he was in Nantucket, he said, quote, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3857.3999999999996s)]
*  the idea we still allow semi-automatic weapons to be purchased is sick. Obviously, that's a huge [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3862.36s)]
*  category of guns from rifles to pistols to shotguns that are not assault weapons. So I guess my question [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3868.6800000000003s)]
*  here is, did the President misspeak or does he in fact want to ban all semi-automatic guns? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3876.36s)]
*  No, he was talking about assault weapons. That's what he was talking about on that morning or that [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3883.0800000000004s)]
*  afternoon when he was asked that question. Thank you. Okay. Good. Yeah. As you know, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3888.84s)]
*  former President Donald Trump had a dinner with Kanye West and Nick Fuentes, a known white nationalist. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3894.76s)]
*  Is the White House concerned that a former President and more importantly a current [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3903.1600000000003s)]
*  candidate for President is meeting with someone who is known to foster racist and anti-Semitic abuse? [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3907.56s)]
*  So look, I'm not going to respond to everything that happens with the former President, but this [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3915.56s)]
*  is something that's important that we speak very clear about and we speak very forcefully about. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3921.0s)]
*  This administration, this President totally rejects bigotry, racism, anti-Semitism, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3928.36s)]
*  and there is just no place for these types of vile forces in our society. This is something [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3935.56s)]
*  that we are going to continue to deny, including Holocaust deniers. And let's not forget, [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3941.72s)]
*  when you say things like this, when you do not speak out against these types of poisonous and [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3947.3199999999997s)]
*  dangerous kind of remarks or representation, if you will, that is also incredibly dangerous [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3955.24s)]
*  within itself. And so we should all be condemning this and we should be very clear, very clear, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3964.76s)]
*  and say it in really absolute clear terms. And again, this is something that we condemn [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3972.6800000000003s)]
*  and we will continue to speak out against. Quick one on the World Cup, please. So just [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3978.28s)]
*  while we're sitting here at nine with a rainbow flag and wearing a t-shirt saying, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3986.28s)]
*  free, no, rather, respect for Iranian women, ran across the pitch and was then taken away. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3991.32s)]
*  So first of all, is the President going to be, I know he's traveling tomorrow and he's [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=3997.96s)]
*  got a good speech and so on, but it's right around the time of the game. Is he going to be, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4001.1600000000003s)]
*  is he going to be basically kept abreast of how that's going? And just on the political side, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4006.36s)]
*  what does he feel about the rights of people to do things like what this man did just now, [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4011.88s)]
*  wave a, wave a LGBT flag and call out Iranian women? Just more broadly, and [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4017.4s)]
*  we'll say this, look, we urge the state of Qatar and all Qataris to fully realize the Amir's [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4025.8s)]
*  message here. And that is to truly recognize and welcome everyone to the cup, to the World Cup. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4032.52s)]
*  And we've been very clear about that. We have said that many times before. We are concerned [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4041.88s)]
*  over the potential treatment of LGBTQ plus spectators and athletes. And, and, you know, [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4048.36s)]
*  this is something that the President will call out any type of human rights abuses. He is, he is [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4056.04s)]
*  not shy and has been very clear raising these issues. And, and he'll continue to do that. And [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4063.6400000000003s)]
*  look, when it comes to the game tomorrow, clearly the President will be kept, kept abreast of how [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4071.24s)]
*  that particular game is going. But as you know, we will be going, we'll be traveling to Michigan [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4076.9199999999996s)]
*  tomorrow. All right. Thanks everybody. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGzd59nMY98&t=4082.2799999999997s)]
