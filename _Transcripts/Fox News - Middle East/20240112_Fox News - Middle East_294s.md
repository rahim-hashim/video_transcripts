# Mike Pompeo warns Iran is prepared to ‘fight to the last Houthi’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw)
*  First to former secretary of state, former CIA director and Fox News contributor Mike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=0.0s)]
*  Pompeo. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=4.2s)]
*  He is on Iran's target list, has been since his time as secretary of state due to the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=5.2s)]
*  maximum pressure campaign that was instituted under the Trump administration against Iran. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=9.92s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, good to have you here, sir. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=18.6s)]
*  So... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=19.6s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=20.6s)]
*  Great to be with you, Martha. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=21.6s)]
*  What was your reaction when you heard about this massive strike last night? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=22.6s)]
*  You had a lot of U.S. assets involved, including the USS Florida. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=25.68s)]
*  What did you make of the retaliation? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  Did you think it was the right tone and right strength? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=32.16s)]
*  Well, Martha, I'm glad that we have finally taken a response that is serious, not like [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=36.04s)]
*  the previous ones, which were way too tepid and way too weak. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=41.8s)]
*  So this is real. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=45.56s)]
*  This was a serious response. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=46.56s)]
*  But my judgment ultimately is you have to cause the Iranians themselves to have real [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=48.2s)]
*  harm done to them, a real cost imposed on them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=53.36s)]
*  The Iranians are willing to fight to the last Houthi, right? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=55.92s)]
*  They won't see this as something that impacts them directly. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=58.72s)]
*  Every missile, every rocket that's fired on an American is an Iranian-made, Iranian intellectual [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=62.56s)]
*  property, Iranian-trained soldier. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=67.76s)]
*  This is all Iran-backed. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=69.84s)]
*  And the Houthis are no more fighting to avenge what happened in Gaza than a man in the moon. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=71.52s)]
*  They are fighting because the Iranians have put them up to this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=77.36s)]
*  And so that's the place we're going to have to go. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=79.88s)]
*  That's who we'll have to impose costs on. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=81.8s)]
*  So what do you think the nature of that is likely to look like? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=83.28s)]
*  What would you be wanting the country and our military to be prepared for here? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=87.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, we experienced this as well. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=94.36s)]
*  We watched the Houthis. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=96.36s)]
*  You'll remember the Houthis have been firing missiles into Saudi Arabia and into the Gulf [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=97.36s)]
*  for years. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  And I can't tell you how many Democrat senators screamed at me because we were surprised to [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  see that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=107.39999999999999s)]
*  And I can't tell you how many Democrat senators screamed at me because we were supporting [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=108.56s)]
*  the kingdom of Saudi Arabia trying to defend itself from these very Iranian-backed terrorists. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=113.44000000000001s)]
*  And then the first move the administration takes is to delist them, to say, no, these [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=119.32000000000001s)]
*  aren't terrorists. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=122.36000000000001s)]
*  These are people that the United States can work with. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=123.36000000000001s)]
*  And so we ought to both mount a diplomatic campaign. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  We ought to redesignate them as terrorists. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=128.08s)]
*  We should be prepared for more missile launches. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=130.44s)]
*  And our Department of Defense is good. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=132.8s)]
*  Even if we have a 99 percent catch rate, even if we stop all of those missiles, we'll eventually [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=135.28s)]
*  have some American hurt. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=139.76s)]
*  And the president put our soldiers, sailors, and airmen and Marines at risk because he [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=141.04s)]
*  was unprepared to defend the things that really mattered and to deter Iran seriously. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=145.68s)]
*  So I want to ask you about this January 1st meeting with all of the heads of the national [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=151.0s)]
*  security team and President Biden, who was in St. Croix at the time on New Year's Day. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=156.76s)]
*  He apparently did not realize, according to all of the reports, that the Secretary [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=162.66s)]
*  of Defense, Lloyd Austin, as they were really planning a retaliatory attack against the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=167.5s)]
*  Houthis, what would it look like, what kind of assets would be used in this, he didn't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=172.01999999999998s)]
*  realize that he had just been in the hospital. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=176.14s)]
*  In fact, Austin headed back to the hospital in an ambulance hours later. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=178.74s)]
*  The more you learn about this, we got a lot more detail on this from some reporting in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=183.38s)]
*  The Washington Post today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=186.82s)]
*  What stands out to you and what's your concern now as we see this attack carried out while [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=189.1s)]
*  Austin's in the hospital? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=195.66s)]
*  Martha, we have a deep bench. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=197.66s)]
*  We have capable organizations, the White House, counsel, but this is incomprehensible to me [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=201.07999999999998s)]
*  that no one knows who's in charge of that, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=206.7s)]
*  It's not that there can't be planning take place without the president there or the secretary [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=208.94s)]
*  himself. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=212.78s)]
*  That happens all the time. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  But the fact that the two most senior leaders, one's on vacation, the other is in the hospital [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=215.18s)]
*  unbeknownst to the other, and apparently the secretary of defense's assistant gets some [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=219.74s)]
*  authority but doesn't really even know why, I must say it's disturbing as someone who [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=223.62s)]
*  was a soldier and then served at the highest levels in the U.S. government to see this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=228.44s)]
*  level of incomprehensible incompetence and know that our adversaries are seeing this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=232.38s)]
*  too. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=238.34s)]
*  It may not well be a coincidence that these attacks have increased in the last few days [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=239.34s)]
*  witnessing the incapability of an administration to simply do the blocking and tackling of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=244.22s)]
*  no where their most senior leaders, the most senior decision makers are located. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=248.46s)]
*  Especially since senior leaders like yourself are also under threat from Iran. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=253.62s)]
*  I know they just re-upped your security detail. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=259.38s)]
*  They said the threat still exists against you and it may be increased based on the escalation [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=261.94s)]
*  that we're seeing. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=269.18s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, thank you for your service and good to have you with us today. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=270.74s)]
*  Yes ma'am, you have a good day. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=274.34000000000003s)]
*  Enjoy Iowa, Martha. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, I always do. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=276.34000000000003s)]
*  It's good to be in Iowa. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_Ye8xlvVZw&t=277.34000000000003s)]
