# Why are Israel and Palestine at odds? Ongoing conflict explained
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI)
*  Hundreds are dead and thousands injured following the horrific Hamas attack against Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=0.0s)]
*  But the conflict today, as we know, it's been stirring for years. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=7.88s)]
*  Yeah, so let's go off the ball once more to understand the history and how this started, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=10.84s)]
*  some of the background between the state of Israel, Palestinians, and how it erupted over [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=16.12s)]
*  this past weekend. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=21.84s)]
*  In fact, while we come at this very humbly, it's complex and there are different sets [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=22.84s)]
*  of facts. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=27.64s)]
*  We think a little bit of historical context can help us understand what's going on in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=28.64s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=32.08s)]
*  Yeah, you could spend a whole semester at a graduate seminar course attempting to break [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=33.08s)]
*  all this down and understand it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=35.8s)]
*  We're going to do it for you in five minutes as best we can. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=37.24s)]
*  So the area known as Israel now was controlled by the Ottoman Empire for 400 years, hundreds [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=39.96s)]
*  of years. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=45.2s)]
*  It was a part of that sprawling empire. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=46.2s)]
*  Of course, the Ottoman Empire joined with the Germans in World War I, and that led to [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=48.08s)]
*  its downfall. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=51.94s)]
*  That really solidified its downfall. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=53.28s)]
*  It had begun to fall apart prior to World War I, but the Ottoman Empire was huge and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=54.76s)]
*  established stability across the entire region from Africa down through the Middle East, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=59.12s)]
*  Turkey and into Europe. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=63.56s)]
*  But as Pete pointed out, following World War I, the stability that was provided by the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=65.88s)]
*  Ottoman Empire disintegrated. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=70.52s)]
*  And it was replaced by a different form of stability in the British mandate. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=72.44s)]
*  So the British government showed interest in establishing a Jewish state. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=77.12s)]
*  There was an agreement called the Belfour Declaration in 1917, which eventually led [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=80.84s)]
*  to the British mandate. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=85.8s)]
*  There was flourishing and coalescing. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=87.84s)]
*  You look at images of Jerusalem and Israel back then, but there was still a lot of conflict, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=90.36s)]
*  just like when the Romans were there in the biblical era. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  The Jewish people wanted their own state. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  Speaking of the biblical era, this entire region, what had largely been tribal, it didn't [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=99.0s)]
*  resemble anything we think of in the modern mind as the nation state. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  But following World War I, Britain through the League of Nations was given control of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=106.76s)]
*  the area and they began to carve up the map. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=110.32s)]
*  They began to create Jordan and Syria and the modern conception of the nation state. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=112.63999999999999s)]
*  I can't remember the name of the of the agreement, but a lot of the consternation across the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  Middle East goes back to Winston Churchill and others who drew a lot of straight lines [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=123.28s)]
*  across previous tribal areas, which led to nation states that have different groups of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=128.48s)]
*  I think of Iraq, what different groups of people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  You certainly see that in Israel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=135.92s)]
*  Now, there was a very tumultuous period in Europe between 1922 and 1947, a lot of anti-Semitism. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=137.92s)]
*  Regimes predicated on the destruction of the Jewish people, most significantly Adolf Hitler [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=144.67999999999998s)]
*  and the Nazi regime, which in the Holocaust that led to the death of six million Jews. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=150.64s)]
*  A lot of Jews left Europe and came back to Israel. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=155.11999999999998s)]
*  And of course, Jews leave Europe, head back to Israel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=158.32s)]
*  There's already Palestinians living in Israel and thus begins your tensions. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=161.76s)]
*  Let's focus in on the geography. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Keith's done a great job this morning going to the maps and explaining the current environment. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=167.4s)]
*  But this is a little bit of a scope out, but still focusing on Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=171.4s)]
*  Israel, roughly the size of New Jersey, west to Palestine, two largely Palestinian areas, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=174.68s)]
*  areas west the West Bank along the West Bank of the Jordan River and the Gaza Strip, where [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  our focus is this morning and throughout this latest incident. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=186.76s)]
*  And a lot of focus of the past has been the so-called West Bank. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=190.24s)]
*  Sometimes we'll call it Judea and Samaria, the historic homeland of the Jewish people [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=194.36s)]
*  as well. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=198.56s)]
*  So words are a big part of this complication inside that as well. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=199.56s)]
*  So we've talked about the Gaza Strip a lot, small area, lots of people. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=203.0s)]
*  You look at the West Bank, just to give you a sense, this is where Jerusalem is. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=208.36s)]
*  And so you've got West Jerusalem and East Jerusalem and a lot of the religious sites [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=213.08s)]
*  were captured in 1967, which we'll get to. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=217.8s)]
*  But when you think of the West Bank, there's a lot of sites in this location of significance [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=220.66s)]
*  to Jews and Christians. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=225.66s)]
*  You've got the traditional baptismal site of Jesus along the Jordan River. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=227.06s)]
*  You've got the walls of Jericho that are there. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=230.46s)]
*  You've got Bethlehem, the birthplace of Jesus. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=232.54s)]
*  So a lot of significance in the Judea and Samaria. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=234.54s)]
*  A good comparison people are making for the West Bank to conceptualize geographically [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=237.66s)]
*  is Delaware, you know, with a third of the population roughly the same geographic size. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=242.0s)]
*  But really quickly, just to put that in context, look how small Gaza Strip is where our focus [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=248.02s)]
*  is a 140 square miles, two million population. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=251.98000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, compare the sizes and the populations are pretty similar. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=255.54000000000002s)]
*  It's extremely dense. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=258.74s)]
*  The complexity only gets worse in terms of the tensions over the past 75 years in the [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=260.66s)]
*  existence of Israel. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=266.38s)]
*  Israel, as we point out, as Jews begin to re-migrate back to Israel, 1947 is a marking [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=268.22s)]
*  point after World War II where there's the first attempt and ultimately is successful [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=276.14s)]
*  in creating the state of Israel. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=282.14s)]
*  And then ultimately, soon thereafter, there was a war, the Arab-Israeli War, where effectively [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  you see Egypt, you see Jordan, they all coalesce on saying, no, no, no, we don't want Jews [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=288.02s)]
*  at a state of Israel here. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=293.9s)]
*  Jordan being very significant, Jordan moved all the way up to Jerusalem and controlled [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=295.78s)]
*  much of that until 1967. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=299.58s)]
*  So it was disputed from the very beginning and has been fought over in the modern sense [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=301.64s)]
*  of the nation-state since 1947. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=306.84s)]
*  The U.S., by the way, the first country to recognize Israel 11 minutes into their existence, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=309.12s)]
*  Harry Truman did so. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=313.15999999999997s)]
*  That war which followed the declaration essentially establishes the state of Israel in 1948. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=314.68s)]
*  And then, Pete, as we pointed out, wars throughout time, but with largely state actors. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=319.88s)]
*  We're talking about Jordan, we're talking about Egypt, we're talking about Syria that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=324.12s)]
*  flashed up since the 40s in two main points. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=328.92s)]
*  The 1967 Six-Day War was one of those, and in fact is one of those that many people are [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=331.92s)]
*  pointing back to today as a marking point of how extreme what we're watching take place [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=337.68s)]
*  today is. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=342.64000000000004s)]
*  That was a really, really big one because the state of Israel, a lot of people thought, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=343.64000000000004s)]
*  okay, its enemies wanted to wipe it off its map. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=347.92s)]
*  Instead, it went on a counteroffensive and captured Gaza, captured Judea and Sumeria [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=350.72s)]
*  in the West Bank, captured the Golan Heights in the north, captured East Jerusalem where [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=356.24s)]
*  they were on the Temple Mount and quickly gave it back. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=361.08s)]
*  But ultimately that redrew the lines and it allowed Israel the opportunity to effectively [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=364.32s)]
*  control these areas for their own security, something that changed in 2005 and is pertinent [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=368.36s)]
*  to our discussion when they gave the Gaza Strip over to the Palestinian Authority. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=373.6s)]
*  So you brought this up earlier this morning. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=377.32s)]
*  You talked about Bibi Netanyahu who immediately said, this is war. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  That war, word, had specific meaning, not an operation, specifically a war. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=382.48s)]
*  Why? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  Because it's 50 years since a war. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=389.84000000000003s)]
*  In 1973, the Yom Kippur War is the last time that type of language, that type of mindset [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=391.32s)]
*  approach has really defined the Palestinian and Israeli confrontation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=395.82s)]
*  But after seeing 600, we're right now, by the way, at 600 civilian children, women, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=401.72s)]
*  grandmothers dead, and this has been declared war. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=408.24s)]
*  This basically settled the nation state aspect of this. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=412.36s)]
*  And after that, you saw intifadas or uprisings led by the PLO, led by Hamas, led by terrorist [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=415.64s)]
*  organizations, trying to achieve their goals inside their regions. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=421.52s)]
*  You saw buses blowing up inside. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=425.52s)]
*  That's why you saw border fences put up across Jerusalem and in Gaza and operations that [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=427.96000000000004s)]
*  led to deaths of Israelis and Palestinians. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O454c_qs5kI&t=433.68s)]
