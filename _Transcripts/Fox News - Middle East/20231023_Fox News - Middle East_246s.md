# NYC protesters tear down posters of hostages kidnapped by Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM)
*  All around New York City, posters of the hostages taken by the Hamas monsters are plastered [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=0.0s)]
*  just about everywhere. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=6.84s)]
*  In fact, street corners, subway stations, construction sites. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=7.84s)]
*  And as quickly as they are going up, people are explicably tearing them down. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=11.76s)]
*  And it often can lead to ugly confrontations. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=17.76s)]
*  But the Israeli artists behind this say every person on those posters deserves to return [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=20.88s)]
*  home. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Jewish artists join me now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=28.88s)]
*  Nitsa Ammins and Dede Bandade are here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=30.16s)]
*  Welcome to you both. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=33.2s)]
*  And I want to first explain to our audience, Dede, that you are an anonymous artist. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=34.2s)]
*  First of all, tell me about putting these posters in and they're really beautiful. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=39.64s)]
*  And you've seen many of these faces because we've been covering and saying people's names. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Why did you do this? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=48.8s)]
*  Well, as soon as we heard about all the news in Israel after this black, horrified Saturday, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=50.8s)]
*  two weeks ago, we immediately knew that we have to do something, that we have to put [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=58.44s)]
*  the message out there. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=63.76s)]
*  We have to raise awareness about the situation, horrible situation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=65.32s)]
*  And you live here? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=70.0s)]
*  We came to New York, both Nitsan and me, about a month ago, just over a month. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=71.68s)]
*  We were on our way to do an art program. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=77.44s)]
*  We didn't expect anything like that to happen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=80.6s)]
*  Wow. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=85.12s)]
*  You appear for an art program ahead of the October 7th attacks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=86.12s)]
*  And you have stayed now to do this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=90.36s)]
*  Nitsan, what does it do to your heart when you see people tearing these down? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=92.36s)]
*  Look at this poster, for example. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=99.12s)]
*  This is Kfil and he's nine months old. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  When a person is ripping apart this baby's face, he thinks that he's tearing down the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=105.28s)]
*  entire Jewish or Israeli entity. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  He does not realize that this baby is a real human being. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=115.8s)]
*  It's not fake. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=121.92s)]
*  This baby is right now probably in a very dark room held by Hamas with guns pointed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=122.92s)]
*  to who knows. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=130.96s)]
*  I mean, I can't even describe how I feel about this baby being held, kidnapped by Hamas. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=132.8s)]
*  You know, when I look through these, I think there are 222 that you have come up with. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=139.96s)]
*  And the new number now from Hamas is 300. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=146.48s)]
*  That is twice that they have increased the number of people they say they have taken. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=149.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, I know some of that is propaganda to scare the world, but we know that there are [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=153.76s)]
*  at least 222 because their posters are up all around New York. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=158.0s)]
*  Are you personally putting these posters up? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=163.0s)]
*  So we started that the day after the war started. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=165.64s)]
*  And we actually posted 2,000 of those posters. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=171.04s)]
*  We created them with our designer friend. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=175.18s)]
*  Her name is Tal Huber. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=178.3s)]
*  She sits in Israel and her studio, her design studio is under attacks of missiles all the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=179.78s)]
*  time. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=185.74s)]
*  She's working from there and we are responsible to do it from here. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=186.74s)]
*  So I can't even tell you how terrible that day was when we started this campaign. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  So Didi, I want to ask you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=199.06s)]
*  You were very quick to get names and pictures. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=201.06s)]
*  How did you do that? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=203.82s)]
*  In the beginning, we just knew we have to act very fast. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  We asked on social media on both our channels for people to send us photos and names of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=209.22s)]
*  people that have been kidnapped. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=216.38s)]
*  Or they thought they had at that point. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=218.38s)]
*  To be kidnapped. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=219.98s)]
*  And we knew that we have to go outside right away and we just have to put it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=220.98s)]
*  We designed the poster to be presented outdoors and we immediately went to work. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=226.18s)]
*  So only later we started talking with the families and get all the real facts and names. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=232.4s)]
*  I thank you both for what you're doing. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=238.96s)]
*  On behalf of all those people who are missing, God bless you both. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=240.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=245.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RvU1Z9oRQfM&t=246.16s)]
