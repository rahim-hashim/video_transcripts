# Israeli military believes Hamas using U.S. military equipment: Chad Robichaux
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo)
*  Would you be surprised if some of the weapons that we decided to leave in Afghanistan ended [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=0.0s)]
*  up in with Hamas and with these terror groups? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=5.74s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=9.72s)]
*  I believe that they already were. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=11.16s)]
*  Seeing some of the photos and videos, it looks like our equipment. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Looks like our equipment. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=17.92s)]
*  Right now, Israeli forces preparing to attack Hamas by air, land, and sea as questions grow [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=19.42s)]
*  amid growing fear about U.S. weapons that were left behind in Afghanistan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Are they now being used by Hamas terrorists? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=30.76s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about fighting terror firsthand. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=33.74s)]
*  Marine vet Chad Robuchaud served in Afghanistan. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=36.72s)]
*  He joins us right now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=40.58s)]
*  Chad, good morning to you. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=41.58s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=42.58s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=43.58s)]
*  They could be used in our weapons to shoot at the Israelis. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=45.540000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, well, Tim's right. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=49.6s)]
*  And not only is Tim right, there are several reports from the ground, from IDFs and from [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=51.6s)]
*  saying that Hamas has American weapons. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=55.84s)]
*  Look, if they have U.S. weapons, they came from us leaving them behind. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=58.88s)]
*  U.S. weapons don't just get in the hands of Hamas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=63.040000000000006s)]
*  Our military is very strict on procedures, even at the lowest level. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=65.88000000000001s)]
*  If you lose a pair of night vision goggles or a single rifle, like in a position that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=69.92s)]
*  I was in, you're looking at losing your career. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=74.28s)]
*  But the truth is, it doesn't really matter if it's true or not. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  The fact that it's possible because President Biden left tens of billions of dollars of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=80.52s)]
*  U.S. equipment in the hands of the Taliban makes America either look complicit or incompetent. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=85.75999999999999s)]
*  I don't know which one's worse. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=91.19999999999999s)]
*  But the assumption is right now by the idea that they're facing American weapons and we [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=92.72s)]
*  did leave billions of dollars worth in Afghanistan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=97.64s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=100.52s)]
*  And, you know, it sounds like a ground war is imminent. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=101.52s)]
*  At the same time, I'm sure, Chad, you've seen the images of people, Americans queuing up, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=105.36s)]
*  trying to get out of the port of Haifa, out at the airport, trying to leave. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=111.32s)]
*  Does it seem to you like the United States government has this coordinated to the point [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=117.12s)]
*  where Americans who want to get the hell out can? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=121.4s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, you know, there's Secretary Blinken's Department of State and, you know, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=124.76s)]
*  President Biden's Department of State. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=131.76s)]
*  They're sending two charter aircrafts. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=132.76s)]
*  There's 170,000 Americans reported to be there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=134.6s)]
*  Even if you're loading up 500 per flight, two flights a day per aircraft, that takes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=138.4s)]
*  80 days. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=142.8s)]
*  The real people that are moving people, Americans out at a more rapid rate, or NGOs, non-government [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=144.72s)]
*  organizations who continue to step up. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=153.04s)]
*  I mean, all the NGOs, especially from America, are stepping up. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=155.76s)]
*  We stepped up in Afghanistan. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  I was part of the evacuation in Afghanistan, in Sudan, in Ukraine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=161.68s)]
*  And now, again, the NGOs are having to step up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=167.04s)]
*  American civilians are having to step up where our government fails. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=170.24s)]
*  I read this morning that apparently a flight with 270 Americans stranded in Israel landed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=173.68s)]
*  in Tampa last night. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  It was organized. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=181.88s)]
*  Apparently Project Dynamo worked with Governor Ron DeSantis, who was there on the tarmac [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=183.92s)]
*  and greeted everybody. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  They were 91 kids as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=190.4s)]
*  You know, we give the numbers, but sometimes we forget they're children. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=192.8s)]
*  They just flew 91 kids out. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=196.24s)]
*  Yeah, Project Dynamo was another one that was working along organizations like Saber [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=199.44s)]
*  Allies in Afghanistan. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=203.68s)]
*  And again, it's the same people stepping up doing the same thing. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=206.24s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=209.44s)]
*  Let's see what happens. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=209.84s)]
*  Chad, thank you very much for joining us live today. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aDjO6zicHMo&t=210.8s)]
