# 'WEAKNESS IN THE MIDDLE EAST': Biden foreign policy blunders blamed for chaos in Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg)
*  Americans are greedy with you. They really are. And Americans are worried. Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=0.0s)]
*  are worried because they know this is not an easy field to navigate, what you have to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=7.0s)]
*  do. But the fact is that Israel, as they respond to these attacks, seems to me that they have [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=16.0s)]
*  to continue to ensure that you have what you need to defend yourself. And we're going to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=24.0s)]
*  make sure that occurs, as you know. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=32.0s)]
*  President Biden wrapping up his bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=35.0s)]
*  moments ago, underscoring his commitment to helping Israel take down Hamas. But concerns [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=40.0s)]
*  are mounting here at home over the White House's ability to regain its footing in the Middle [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=45.0s)]
*  East while continuing to support Ukraine and thwarting potential threats from China [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=50.0s)]
*  and North Korea. Derek Anderson is an Army veteran and Virginia congressional candidate [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=55.0s)]
*  and joins me now. Derek, good morning to you. What about that? There are a lot of flash [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=60.0s)]
*  points right now between Russia and Ukraine, Israel and Hamas and this looming threat between [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=65.0s)]
*  China and Taiwan. And the United States is providing munitions to all of them. Can we [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=71.0s)]
*  handle it all? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=76.0s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a lot to handle. And thank you all so much for having me. I mean, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=79.0s)]
*  right now, we have to look at the 50-meter target. In the military, we always talk about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=84.0s)]
*  50-meter targets, 100-meter targets, 300-meter targets. Right now, Israel is in dire need, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=89.0s)]
*  whether it's their need for munitions or just having someone have their back in the region. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=96.0s)]
*  I do think that is important. We've seen the deployment of USS Eisenhower and Joe Ford [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=101.0s)]
*  strike groups that are heading over into the Mediterranean to provide support for the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=108.0s)]
*  Israelis. I mean, when you are thinking about the hostages that are currently being held [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=114.0s)]
*  right now, we're looking at roughly 200 hostages. Whether or not they are able to hear anything [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=119.0s)]
*  about this, but think about the need that they're in right now. Knowing that the Americans [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=125.0s)]
*  are coming right now gives them that hope that they have the opportunity to be pulled [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=130.0s)]
*  out of the Gaza and be saved. And I think that's really important. I think we need to [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=136.0s)]
*  continue to show force in the Middle East. The Biden administration has shown its weakness, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=141.0s)]
*  which is one of the reasons I think that we are in the current situation that we are, and the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=147.0s)]
*  Israelis are in the current situation they are, whether it began with the BOTS withdrawal in [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=151.0s)]
*  Afghanistan or relations throughout the world. But this is a time to show strength, and this is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=156.0s)]
*  our opportunity to be strong throughout the world. Yeah, it is true. The Biden and for that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=164.0s)]
*  matter, the Trump administration's goal was to decrease our military presence in the Middle [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=169.0s)]
*  East. And the withdrawal from Afghanistan is the most notable example of that. But given this [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=174.0s)]
*  unfolding war in Israel right now, do you think the Pentagon needs to rethink that strategy? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=178.0s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, if you look at right before, you know, two Saturdays ago before this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=184.0s)]
*  massacre happened in Israel, the Biden administration was just talking about decreasing the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=191.0s)]
*  funding, roughly 10% of our special operations community. If you look at the wars that we've [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=197.0s)]
*  been fighting over the last two decades, our special operations community has been at the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=203.0s)]
*  forefront of all of these. You know, I was a Green Beret for a little around 10 years as I served [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=208.0s)]
*  in the Army. I trained with the Israeli defense forces, and these relationships that we build, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=214.0s)]
*  especially through our special operations community, are vitally important. And so, you [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=219.0s)]
*  know, you can see what just happened literally the week before this attack happened in Israel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=224.0s)]
*  You know, the Biden administration talked about cutting 10% of our special operations community. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=231.0s)]
*  You know, you all were reporting a little bit in the very beginning of this is that we were [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=235.0s)]
*  sending some of our tier one assets or special forces assets over to Israel in an advisory [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=239.0s)]
*  capacity. And it wouldn't surprise me if we had individuals on the ground already that were [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=246.0s)]
*  advising the Israelis as well as doing concurrent training with them. So it's vitally important [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=252.0s)]
*  not only just for our own national security, but for the security within the region. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=259.0s)]
*  Yeah, and let's talk about that, the ground invasion that could possibly happen. Everybody that we [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=263.0s)]
*  talk to talks about how brutal it could be, you know, when you're talking about urban warfare and [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=268.0s)]
*  all of what that presents. Do you think that there's any chance that that could be avoided and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=274.0s)]
*  for the IDF to still achieve their ultimate goal of destroying Hamas? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=281.0s)]
*  Well, you have to also understand, I mean, by all means, if they wanted to just destroy Hamas and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=288.0s)]
*  the infrastructures that are within Gaza, they could very well just use artillery and use an aerial [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=293.0s)]
*  strike to destroy and level everything. But the issue that the Israelis are going to have [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=299.0s)]
*  specifically in Gaza is this complex tunnel network. You know, you can only penetrate the tunnel [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=305.0s)]
*  network so much from above. And the fact that we have 200-ish hostages there, we're not going to be [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=312.0s)]
*  able to just, I mean, you can't go in and rescue hostages through an aerial strike, right? We're [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=319.0s)]
*  going to have to put boots on the ground. And with that, it means it's going to be a methodical [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=323.0s)]
*  clearance of Gaza. Intelligence is still going to be, you know, intelligence drives our operations, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=328.0s)]
*  and it's going to be one of those things where it's going to be a methodical clearance. It's going to [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=335.0s)]
*  take a little bit of time for the Israelis to go through door to door, building to building, not only [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=339.0s)]
*  to destroy the weapons depots, the missile, the stockpiles and missiles, but they're going to need [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=344.0s)]
*  to go and try to extract these hostages, and that's going to take some time. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=350.0s)]
*  It is a daunting prospect. Derek Anderson, we do have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us on this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=355.0s)]
*  busy Newsday. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ejEHkmg2wg&t=359.0s)]
