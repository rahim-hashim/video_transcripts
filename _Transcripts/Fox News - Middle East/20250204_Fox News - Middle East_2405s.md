# President Trump and Prime Minister Netanyahu hold joint news conference
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js)
*  It's a wonderful feeling and a wonderful event. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=0.0s)]
*  We had fantastic talks. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=3.6s)]
*  And thank you very much with your staff. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  He's the first foreign head of state to visit during our [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=10.28s)]
*  administration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=13.34s)]
*  And, Bibi, I want to say it's an honor to have you with us. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=14.24s)]
*  Over the past four years, the U.S. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=19.76s)]
*  and the Israeli alliance has been tested more than any time [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=21.42s)]
*  in history. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=26.8s)]
*  But the bonds of friendship and affection between the American [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=29.36s)]
*  and Israeli people have endured for generations, and they are [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=32.4s)]
*  absolutely unbreakable. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=36.6s)]
*  They are unbreakable. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=38.0s)]
*  I'm confident that, under our leadership, the cherished [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=40.56s)]
*  alliance between our two countries will soon be stronger [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=43.76s)]
*  than ever. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=47.14s)]
*  We had a great relationship. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=47.6s)]
*  We had great victories together four years ago. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=49.64s)]
*  Not so many victories over the past four years, however. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  In my first term, Prime Minister and I forged a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=56.88s)]
*  tremendously successful partnership that brought peace [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=60.22s)]
*  and stability to the Middle East like it hadn't seen in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=63.78s)]
*  decades. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=67.38s)]
*  Together, we defeated ISIS. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=68.72s)]
*  We ended the disastrous Iran nuclear deal, one of the worst [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=70.32s)]
*  deals ever made, by the way, and imposed the toughest-ever [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=73.52s)]
*  sanctions on the Iranian regime. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  We starved Hamas and Iran's other terrorist proxies, and we [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=80.44s)]
*  starved them like they had never seen before. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=85.89999999999999s)]
*  Resources and support disappeared for them. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=88.69999999999999s)]
*  I recognized Israel's capital, opened the American embassy in [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=92.64s)]
*  Jerusalem, and got it built, by the way. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=96.78s)]
*  Built it, too. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=99.52s)]
*  Just not only designated it, but got it built at a price that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=100.42s)]
*  nobody's seen for 40 years. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=104.72s)]
*  We got it built. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=107.86s)]
*  It's beautiful. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=108.66s)]
*  All Jerusalem stone right from nearby, and it was something [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=109.5s)]
*  that's very special. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=113.96s)]
*  And recognized Israeli sovereignty over the Golan [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=115.52s)]
*  Heights, something that they talked about for 70 years, and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=119.1s)]
*  they weren't able to get it, and I got it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=123.1s)]
*  And with the historic Abraham Accords, something that was [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=126.5s)]
*  really an achievement that was, I think, going to become more [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=129.3s)]
*  and more important because we achieved the most significant [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=134.1s)]
*  Middle East peace agreements in half a century. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=137.18s)]
*  But the Abraham Accords in particular, and I really [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=140.48s)]
*  believe that many countries will soon be joining this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  amazing peace and economic development transaction. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=146.5s)]
*  It really is a big economic development transaction. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=149.70000000000002s)]
*  I think we're going to have a lot of people signing up very [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  quickly, unfortunately, for four years. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=156.44s)]
*  Nobody signed up. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=158.28s)]
*  Nobody did anything for four years except in the negative. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  Unfortunately, the weakness and incompetence of those years, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=163.36s)]
*  those past four years, the grave damage around the globe [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=167.66000000000003s)]
*  that was done, including in the Middle East, grave damage [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  all over the globe. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=174.79999999999998s)]
*  The horrors of October 7th would never have happened [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=176.7s)]
*  if I were President. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=180.72s)]
*  The Ukraine and Russia disaster would never have happened [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=182.38s)]
*  if I were President. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=186.62s)]
*  Over the past 16 months, Israel has endured a sustained, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=188.06s)]
*  aggressive, and murderous assault on every front, but they [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=192.16s)]
*  fought back bravely. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=196.14s)]
*  You see that and you know that. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=197.29999999999998s)]
*  What we have witnessed is an all-out attack on the very [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=198.73999999999998s)]
*  existence of a Jewish state in the Jewish homeland. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  The Israelis have stood strong and united in the face of an [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=207.32s)]
*  enemy that has kidnapped, tortured, raped, and slaughtered [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=210.95999999999998s)]
*  innocent men, women, children, and even little babies. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=215.6s)]
*  I want to salute the Israeli people for meeting this trial [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=219.89999999999998s)]
*  with courage and determination and unflinching resolve. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=224.2s)]
*  They have been strong. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=227.7s)]
*  In our meetings today, the Prime Minister and I focused [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=230.14s)]
*  on the future, discussing how we can work together to ensure [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=232.94s)]
*  Hamas is eliminated and ultimately restore peace to a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=236.51999999999998s)]
*  very troubled region. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=240.92s)]
*  It's been troubled, but what's happened in the last four years [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=243.66s)]
*  has not been good. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  I want to thank Prime Minister Netanyahu for working closely [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  with my transition team, the Special Envoy Steve Witkoff, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=251.72s)]
*  who's here somewhere. Steve? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=257.14000000000004s)]
*  Stand up, Steve, please. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=259.74s)]
*  What a job you've done. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=260.98s)]
*  What a good job you've done. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=262.5s)]
*  Proud of you. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  You've done a fantastic job. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=266.48s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Walz. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=267.88s)]
*  Thank you, Mike, for working so well with us. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=270.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=273.02000000000004s)]
*  We have, in addition, Marco Rubio, who is on the phone [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=275.06s)]
*  right now, listening to every single word that we say. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=281.06s)]
*  And he's going to be great. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=284.46000000000004s)]
*  And Pete, congratulations. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=285.46s)]
*  And Scott, congratulations. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=287.12s)]
*  I see you're here. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=289.02s)]
*  And Caroline's been doing a great job. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=290.7s)]
*  She's really probably talked about more than anybody here. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=294.26s)]
*  She's done a fantastic job. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  And thank you very much, Caroline. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=299.7s)]
*  We're proud of you. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=300.97999999999996s)]
*  But we'll only be satisfied when all of these problems [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=302.59999999999997s)]
*  are solved and we have the team to solve them. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=307.02s)]
*  And that's going to happen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=309.08s)]
*  And it's going to happen, I think, very quickly. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  I also strongly believe that the Gaza Strip, which has been [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=313.59999999999997s)]
*  a symbol of death and destruction for so many [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=316.78s)]
*  decades and so bad for the people anywhere near it, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=319.18s)]
*  and especially those who live there, and frankly, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=323.32s)]
*  who's been really very unlucky. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=326.36s)]
*  It's been very unlucky. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=328.38s)]
*  It's been an unlucky place for a long time. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=329.38s)]
*  Being in its presence just has not been good. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=332.36s)]
*  And it should not go through a process of rebuilding [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=336.46s)]
*  and occupation by the same people that have really stood [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=339.06s)]
*  there and fought for it and lived there and died there [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=344.02s)]
*  and lived a miserable existence there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=348.7s)]
*  Instead, we should go to other countries of interest [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=352.1s)]
*  with humanitarian hearts. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=355.84000000000003s)]
*  And there are many of them that want to do this and build [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=357.36s)]
*  various domains that will ultimately be occupied by the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=360.94s)]
*  1.8 million Palestinians living in Gaza, ending the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=364.24s)]
*  death and destruction and, frankly, bad luck. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  This can be paid for by neighboring countries [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=372.46s)]
*  of great wealth. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=374.64s)]
*  It could be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 12. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=376.03999999999996s)]

*  Today, I also took action to restore a maximum pressure [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=521.18s)]

*  Two weeks ago, I once again designated the Houthis as a [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=563.54s)]

*  that's not going to happen. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=573.14s)]

*  And you just freed it. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=783.74s)]
*  You ended unjust sanctions against law-abiding Israeli [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=785.9s)]
*  citizens. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=789.42s)]
*  You boldly confronted the scourge of anti-Semitism. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=790.94s)]
*  You stopped funding, as you just said, international [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=796.22s)]
*  organizations like UNRWA that support and fund terrorists. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=798.82s)]
*  And today, you renewed the maximum pressure [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=804.78s)]
*  campaign against Iran. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=808.3s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, all this in just two weeks. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=811.7s)]
*  Can we imagine where we'll be in four years? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=815.5s)]
*  I can. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=819.42s)]
*  I know you can, Mr. President. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=820.5799999999999s)]
*  For our part, we in Israel have been pretty busy, too. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=824.02s)]
*  Since the horrendous October 7th attack, we've been fighting [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=828.9399999999999s)]
*  our common enemies and changing the face of the Middle East. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=832.78s)]
*  On that infamous day, Hamas monsters savagely murdered [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=837.74s)]
*  1,200 innocent people, including more than 40 [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=843.58s)]
*  Americans. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=848.0600000000001s)]
*  They beheaded men. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=849.9000000000001s)]
*  They raped women. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=851.62s)]
*  They burnt babies alive. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=853.5s)]
*  And they took 251 people hostage to the dungeons of Gaza. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=856.4200000000001s)]
*  And after this worst attack on Jews since the Holocaust, Iran [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=862.7s)]
*  and its henchmen in the Middle East were absolutely ecstatic. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=868.82s)]
*  Haneeya praised the massacre. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=873.42s)]
*  Sinwar said that Israel was finished. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=875.54s)]
*  Nasrallah boasted that Israel was, here's what he said, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=879.22s)]
*  as feeble as a spider's web. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=883.02s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, Haneeya is gone. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=887.14s)]
*  Sinwar is gone. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=891.1s)]
*  Nasrallah is gone. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=893.42s)]
*  We've devastated Hamas. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=895.58s)]
*  We decimated Hezbollah. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=897.5s)]
*  We destroyed Assad's remaining armaments. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=899.58s)]
*  And we crippled Iran's air defenses. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=902.86s)]
*  And in doing this, we've defeated some of America's worst [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=906.14s)]
*  enemies. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=910.58s)]
*  We took out terrorists who were wanted for decades [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=912.0600000000001s)]
*  for shedding rivers of American blood, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=916.5s)]
*  including the blood of 241 Marines murdered in Beirut. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=919.58s)]
*  We accomplished all this with the indomitable spirit [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=924.94s)]
*  of our people and the boundless courage of our soldiers. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=928.98s)]
*  The Bible says that the people of Israel shall rise like lions. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=933.9000000000001s)]
*  And boy did we rise. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=939.74s)]
*  Today, the roar of the Lion of Judah [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=941.86s)]
*  is heard loudly throughout the Middle East. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=944.2600000000001s)]
*  Israel has never been stronger. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=947.5400000000001s)]
*  And the Iran terror axis has never been weaker. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=949.74s)]
*  But as we discussed, Mr. President, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=953.9000000000001s)]
*  to secure our future and bring peace to our region, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=956.9s)]
*  we have to finish the job. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=961.58s)]
*  In Gaza, Israel has three goals. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=964.1s)]
*  Destroy Hamas's military and governing capabilities, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=966.74s)]
*  secure the release of all of our hostages, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=970.02s)]
*  and ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=973.1800000000001s)]
*  I believe, Mr. President, that your willingness [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=978.42s)]
*  to puncture conventional thinking, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=982.1s)]
*  thinking that has failed time and time and time again, [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=984.54s)]
*  your willingness to think outside the box with fresh ideas [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=988.06s)]
*  will help us achieve all these goals. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=992.62s)]
*  And I've seen you do this many times. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=995.3399999999999s)]
*  You cut to the chase. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=998.3399999999999s)]
*  You see things others refuse to see. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1000.6999999999999s)]
*  You say things others refuse to say. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1005.14s)]
*  And after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1008.02s)]
*  And they say, you know, he's right. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1012.94s)]
*  And this is the kind of thinking that [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1016.5400000000001s)]
*  enabled us to bring the Abraham Accords. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1018.9000000000001s)]
*  This is the kind of thinking that will reshape the Middle [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1021.86s)]
*  East and bring peace. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1024.3s)]
*  We also see eye to eye on Iran. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1027.6200000000001s)]
*  That's the same Iran. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1033.8600000000001s)]
*  They try to kill us both. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1035.54s)]
*  They try to kill you, Mr. President. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1037.98s)]
*  They try through their proxies to kill me. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1040.78s)]
*  We're both committed to rolling back Iran's aggression [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1044.3s)]
*  in the region and ensuring that Iran never [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1046.8999999999999s)]
*  develops a nuclear weapon. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1050.54s)]
*  Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1053.86s)]
*  Israel will end the war by winning the war. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1057.7s)]
*  Israel's victory will be America's victory. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1061.98s)]
*  We will not only win the war, working together, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1065.3799999999999s)]
*  we will win the peace. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1069.54s)]
*  With your leadership, Mr. President, and our [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1071.82s)]
*  partnership, I believe that we will forge a brilliant future [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1073.8999999999999s)]
*  for our region and bring our great alliance [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1077.86s)]
*  to even greater heights. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1081.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1084.02s)]

*  JD Vance, everybody. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1089.1399999999999s)]
*  JD, please, Vice President, stand up. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1090.5s)]
*  He's been doing a good job. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1094.1399999999999s)]
*  He's been working very hard on all things. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1095.26s)]
*  But this in particular. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1099.06s)]
*  We'll take some questions, please. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1100.78s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1103.86s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1104.62s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1106.26s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1107.18s)]
*  The Press. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1107.94s)]
*  Can a normalization deal with Saudi Arabia be achieved [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1108.94s)]
*  without the acknowledgement of a Palestinian state? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1112.3799999999999s)]
*  That question for you, too, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1114.9s)]
*  And, Mr. President, given what you've said about Gaza, [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1117.42s)]
*  did the U.S. send troops to help secure the security vacuum? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1120.5s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia is going to be very helpful, [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1125.46s)]
*  and they have been very helpful. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1127.98s)]
*  They want peace in the Middle East. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1129.02s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1130.3s)]
*  We know their leader and their leaders very well. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1132.8200000000002s)]
*  They're wonderful people, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1135.54s)]
*  and they want peace in the Middle East. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1136.9s)]
*  As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1138.94s)]
*  If it's necessary, we'll do that. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1142.66s)]
*  We're going to take over that peace, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1144.38s)]
*  and we're going to develop it, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1146.6200000000001s)]
*  create thousands and thousands of jobs. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1147.94s)]
*  And it'll be something that the entire Middle East [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1150.74s)]
*  can be very proud of. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1153.02s)]
*  But everybody feels that continuing the same process [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1154.74s)]
*  that's gone on forever, over and over again, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1159.06s)]
*  and then it starts, and then the killing starts, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1162.7s)]
*  and all of the other problems start, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1164.94s)]
*  and you end up in the same place, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1167.98s)]
*  and we don't want to see that happen. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1170.78s)]
*  So by the United States, with its stability and strength, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1172.66s)]
*  owning it, especially the strength that we're developing [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1176.06s)]
*  and developed over the last fairly short period of time, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1178.38s)]
*  I would say really since the election, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1181.26s)]
*  I think we'll be a great keeper of something [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1185.02s)]
*  that is very, very strong, very powerful, [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1187.78s)]
*  and very, very good for the area, [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1190.1s)]
*  not just for Israel, for the entire Middle East. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1191.66s)]
*  Very important. And we'll, again, have thousands of jobs. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1193.82s)]
*  And there'll be jobs for everyone, [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1197.46s)]
*  not for a specific group of people, but for everybody. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1199.66s)]
*  Okay? Please. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1203.5s)]
*  I think peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1206.82s)]
*  is not only feasible. I think it's going to happen. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1209.98s)]
*  I think if we had another half a year in your first term, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1212.9s)]
*  it would have already happened. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1217.74s)]
*  The President's voice is clear. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1219.22s)]
*  I agree. Many more nations. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1220.42s)]
*  It would have happened. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1222.22s)]
*  I think you can't prejudge [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1223.1000000000001s)]
*  and pre-guess how we'll achieve it, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1225.1000000000001s)]
*  but I'm committed to achieving it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1229.14s)]
*  I know the President is committed to achieving it. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1230.6200000000001s)]
*  And I think the Saudi leadership is interested to achieve it. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1233.18s)]
*  So we'll give it a good shot, and I think we'll succeed. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1236.66s)]
*  Yeah, please. Go ahead. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1240.58s)]
*  The Press. First of all, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1242.22s)]
*  did you hear from Prime Minister Niala Jamee [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1243.58s)]
*  guaranteeing that ceasefire will hold in the beginning of phase two [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1246.9399999999998s)]
*  and planning for the end of the second wave? [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1252.22s)]
*  Why are you refusing to send the national mission [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1254.62s)]
*  to investigate the standards of arms sales? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1257.26s)]
*  The President. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1259.58s)]
*  Well, I can't tell you whether or not the ceasefire will hold. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1260.58s)]
*  We've done, I think, a very masterful job. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1263.22s)]
*  We weren't helped very much by the Biden administration, [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1267.54s)]
*  I can tell you that. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1270.6599999999999s)]
*  But we've gotten quite a few hostages out. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1272.22s)]
*  We're going to get more out. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1275.6599999999999s)]
*  But we're dealing with very complex people. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1277.6599999999999s)]
*  And we are going to see whether or not it holds. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1280.3799999999999s)]
*  We certainly want to have more come out. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1282.74s)]
*  They've come out damaged, in many ways. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1285.26s)]
*  Damaged. Very damaged people. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1288.6599999999999s)]
*  But they're going to get better and they're going to be strong [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1291.1s)]
*  and they're going to have a good life. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1293.3s)]
*  And we hope to get as many as possible out. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1295.5s)]
*  Whether or not it holds, I don't know. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1297.46s)]
*  We hope it holds. We hope it holds. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1298.9s)]
*  I think that the appropriate time, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1302.98s)]
*  which I think will enable us to really investigate what happens, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1305.42s)]
*  what were the causes of the failures [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1311.14s)]
*  by an independent commission [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1314.02s)]
*  that will be accepted by the majority of the people? [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1316.02s)]
*  We don't want it accepted by one half of the people and not the other. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1320.6200000000001s)]
*  I think we should have it. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1324.8600000000001s)]
*  And we should find out exactly what happened. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1326.8600000000001s)]
*  I'm insisting on it. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1329.06s)]
*  And believe me, it will surprise a lot of people when it happens. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1331.18s)]
*  Kelly. Kelly, go ahead. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1336.82s)]
*  The Press. Mr. President, you are outlining something [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1338.42s)]
*  that is really quite striking tonight. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1340.42s)]
*  You are talking about — [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1342.02s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1346.22s)]
*  You are talking tonight about the United States [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1347.94s)]
*  taking over a sovereign territory. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1350.14s)]
*  What authority would allow you to do that? [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1352.86s)]
*  Are you talking about a permanent occupation there? [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1354.98s)]
*  Redevelopment? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1358.54s)]
*  And, Mr. Prime Minister, do you see this idea [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1359.86s)]
*  as a way to expand the boundaries of Israel [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1362.06s)]
*  and to have a longer peace, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1365.06s)]
*  even though the Israeli people know how important that land is to you [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1367.62s)]
*  and your citizens, [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1372.22s)]
*  just as the space is inherited by the Palestinians as well? [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1373.8999999999999s)]
*  I do see a long-term ownership position, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1379.2199999999998s)]
*  and I see it bringing great stability [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1382.82s)]
*  to that part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1385.4199999999998s)]
*  And everybody I've spoken to — [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1389.54s)]
*  this was not a decision made lightly. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1391.1399999999999s)]
*  Everybody I've spoken to loves the idea of the United States [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1393.4199999999998s)]
*  owning that piece of land, [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1397.02s)]
*  developing and creating thousands of jobs [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1398.6999999999998s)]
*  with something that will be magnificent [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1400.9399999999998s)]
*  in a really magnificent area that nobody would know. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1403.3s)]
*  Nobody can look because all they see is death and destruction [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1406.22s)]
*  and rubble and demolished buildings falling all over. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1409.18s)]
*  It's just a terrible site. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1413.9s)]
*  I've studied it — I've studied this very closely over a lot of months, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1416.94s)]
*  and I've seen it from every different angle. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1422.18s)]
*  And it's a very, very dangerous place to be. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1424.66s)]
*  And it's only going to get worse. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1427.3s)]
*  And I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1429.5800000000002s)]
*  And I'm talking about, from the highest level of leadership, [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1432.8999999999999s)]
*  gotten tremendous praise. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1436.5s)]
*  And if the United States can help to bring stability [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1437.86s)]
*  and peace in the Middle East, we'll do that. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1441.1s)]
*  Baby. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1443.4199999999998s)]
*  I mentioned again tonight our three goals. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1446.86s)]
*  And the third goal is to make sure that Gaza [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1451.4199999999998s)]
*  never poses a threat to Israel again. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1454.3799999999999s)]
*  President Trump is taking it to a much higher level. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1457.4599999999998s)]
*  He sees a different future for that piece of land [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1460.54s)]
*  that has been the focus of so much terrorism, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1465.66s)]
*  so many attacks against us, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1469.74s)]
*  so many trials and so many tribulations. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1471.58s)]
*  He has a different idea. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1477.18s)]
*  And I think it's worth paying attention to this. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1479.26s)]
*  We're talking about it. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1482.38s)]
*  He's exploring it with his people, with his staff. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1484.46s)]
*  I think it's something that could change history. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1487.66s)]
*  And it's worthwhile really pursuing this avenue. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1490.54s)]
*  Yeah, please, go ahead. Go ahead. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1495.22s)]
*  Mr. President, I have a question for you. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1496.98s)]
*  Can you hear me? [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1499.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1500.7s)]
*  So, before rebuilding Gaza, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1501.8600000000001s)]
*  again, obviously, we've taken out all the hostages, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1504.3s)]
*  and one of them is Adan Alexander, [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1507.3400000000001s)]
*  an American soldier who is alive. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1508.9s)]
*  How will you be sure that you will take out all the hostages [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1511.46s)]
*  and then rebuild Gaza? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1516.94s)]
*  Well, we're working very hard to get all the hostages. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1518.6200000000001s)]
*  The word is all, and we are working very hard. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1520.7s)]
*  So far, it's been moving along fairly rapidly, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1523.78s)]
*  pretty much on schedule. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1527.82s)]
*  I'd love to have them all out at one time, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1530.02s)]
*  but we're taking them out. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1531.54s)]
*  And tomorrow, more are being released, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1533.6200000000001s)]
*  and over the days, more. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1535.78s)]
*  And then we're going to a phase two. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1537.02s)]
*  But we'd like to get all of the hostages. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1539.7s)]
*  And if we don't, it will just make us somewhat more violent, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1541.78s)]
*  I will tell you that, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1548.02s)]
*  because they would have broken their word. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1549.1s)]
*  Mr. Witkoff and his entire group [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1551.26s)]
*  have been working 24 hours around the clock, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1554.06s)]
*  and they want them out, and promises have been made to them. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1557.9s)]
*  And we'll see whether or not those promises will be kept. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1561.58s)]
*  But we want all the hostages. That's right. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1565.02s)]
*  How much time do you think it will take? [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1567.3s)]
*  A month? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1568.6200000000001s)]
*  Do you support Israeli sovereignty in Judean Samaria, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1569.82s)]
*  areas which many believe is the biblical homeland [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1575.06s)]
*  of the Jewish people? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1578.26s)]
*  Well, we're discussing that with many of your representatives. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1579.3799999999999s)]
*  You represented very well. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1583.06s)]
*  And people do like the idea, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1584.98s)]
*  but we haven't taken a position on it yet. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1587.58s)]
*  But we will be making an announcement, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1590.3799999999999s)]
*  probably on that very specific topic, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1593.62s)]
*  over the next four weeks. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1596.26s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1599.82s)]
*  Please. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1600.82s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mr. President. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1601.82s)]
*  You just said that you think all the Palestinians [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1604.82s)]
*  should be relocated to other countries. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1611.1799999999998s)]
*  Does that mean that you do not support a two-state solution? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1614.1s)]
*  It doesn't mean anything about a two-state or one state [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1617.98s)]
*  or any other state. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1620.86s)]
*  It means that we want to have, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1622.22s)]
*  we want to give people a chance at life. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1624.74s)]
*  They have never had a chance at life, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1626.78s)]
*  because the Gaza Strip has been a hellhole [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1628.42s)]
*  for people living there. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1631.38s)]
*  It's been horrible. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1632.46s)]
*  The Hamas has made it so bad, so bad, so dangerous, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1633.78s)]
*  so unfair to people. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1639.3400000000001s)]
*  And by doing what I'm recommending that we do, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1641.38s)]
*  it's a very strong recommendation, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1643.94s)]
*  but it is a strong recommendation. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1645.94s)]
*  By doing that, we think we're gonna bring, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1647.7s)]
*  perhaps, great peace to long beyond this area. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1650.54s)]
*  And I have to stress, this is not for Israel. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1653.42s)]
*  This is for everybody in the Middle East, Arabs, Muslims. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1657.02s)]
*  This is for everybody. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1659.94s)]
*  This would be where they can partake in terms of jobs [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1660.94s)]
*  and living and all of the other benefits. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1664.46s)]
*  And I think it's very important. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1667.1399999999999s)]
*  It just doesn't work the other way. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1668.62s)]
*  You can't keep trying. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1670.74s)]
*  They just, as we've been going along for so many decades, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1671.98s)]
*  you can't even count. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1675.62s)]
*  You just can't keep doing. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1676.78s)]
*  You have to learn from history. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1678.22s)]
*  You can't keep doing the same mistake over and over again. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1679.3s)]
*  Gaza is a hellhole right now. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1683.66s)]
*  It was before the bombing started, frankly. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1686.06s)]
*  And we're gonna give people a chance to live [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1688.94s)]
*  in a beautiful community that's safe and secure. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1691.26s)]
*  And I think you're gonna see [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1694.7s)]
*  a tremendous outflowing of support. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1696.98s)]
*  I can tell you, I spoke to other leaders [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1700.7s)]
*  of countries in the Middle East, and they loved the idea. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1703.06s)]
*  They said it would really bring stability, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1706.22s)]
*  and what we need is stability. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1707.94s)]
*  Yes, sir, please. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1709.98s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1712.3799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1713.82s)]
*  Are you still committed to imposing sanctions on the ICC [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1715.1s)]
*  despite the move being stalled in the Senate? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1719.02s)]
*  And please, a question for the Prime Minister as well. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1721.34s)]
*  The President has been very clear about his desire [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1724.02s)]
*  to achieve a deal with Saudi Arabia. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1726.86s)]
*  How do you settle this if Israel is required [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1728.7s)]
*  to renew the war against Hamas in the future? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1731.8999999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, baby. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1735.22s)]
*  I think everybody understands that just as [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1738.1s)]
*  the President fought and defeated al-Qaeda and ISIS, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1741.1000000000001s)]
*  that we can't leave Hamas there [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1746.22s)]
*  because Hamas will continue the battle to destroy Israel. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1747.98s)]
*  They'll do, you know, in this temporary ceasefire, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1752.0600000000002s)]
*  one of their leaders comes out, you know what he says? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1755.8600000000001s)]
*  We're gonna do October 7th again, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1759.6200000000001s)]
*  except we'll do it bigger. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1762.3000000000002s)]
*  So obviously, you can't talk about peace. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  Neither with Hamas or in the Middle East, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1769.42s)]
*  if this toxic, murderous organization is left standing. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1771.6200000000001s)]
*  Anymore that you could make peace in Europe [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1777.46s)]
*  after World War II, [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1779.6200000000001s)]
*  if the Nazi regime was left standing [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1781.14s)]
*  and the Nazi army was left standing. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1783.46s)]
*  You want a different future? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1785.98s)]
*  You gotta knock out the people who want to destroy you [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1787.1000000000001s)]
*  and destroy peace. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1789.9s)]
*  That's what we're gonna do. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1790.8600000000001s)]
*  I think that will also bring usher in, actually, [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1792.42s)]
*  the peace with Saudi Arabia and with others. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1795.98s)]
*  And I think there will be others too. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1798.5s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1800.3400000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1801.18s)]
*  I'm from Afghanistan. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1802.02s)]
*  My name is Miss Gazi Karimi, [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1803.22s)]
*  Afghan suffered woman, as I expectation from you. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1804.7s)]
*  Do you have any plan to change Afghanistan situation? [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1807.98s)]
*  Are you able to recognize Taliban? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1810.9s)]
*  Because I'm an Afghan journalist, Afghan suffered woman. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1813.5s)]
*  Any comment about Afghanistan? [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1817.02s)]
*  What's your future plan for Afghan people, [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1818.54s)]
*  especially Afghan? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1820.8200000000002s)]
*  I have a little hard time understanding you. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1821.66s)]
*  Where are you from? [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1824.74s)]
*  No, actually, it's a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1826.78s)]
*  The only problem is I can't understand the word you're saying. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1830.58s)]
*  But I just say this, good luck, live in peace. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1834.54s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1838.9799999999998s)]
*  That's okay, yeah, please. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1844.5s)]
*  Ma'am, Mr. President, sir, you said earlier today [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1846.06s)]
*  it was tough for you to implement these sanctions on Iran, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1848.9399999999998s)]
*  but you did indicate that you were willing [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1853.2199999999998s)]
*  to negotiate with them. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1855.06s)]
*  What would that look like, and are you in conversations [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1856.02s)]
*  with them and the same for the Prime Minister? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1858.82s)]
*  I hated doing it. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1861.06s)]
*  I want Iran to be peaceful and successful. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1862.82s)]
*  I hated doing it. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1866.46s)]
*  I did it once before, and we brought them down to a level [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1867.94s)]
*  where they were unable to give any money. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1871.8999999999999s)]
*  They had to survive themselves, and they had no money. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1873.58s)]
*  They were essentially broke. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1876.7s)]
*  And they had no money for, as I said, Hezbollah. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1879.74s)]
*  They had no money for Hamas. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1882.54s)]
*  They had no money for any form of terror. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1884.02s)]
*  The 28, if you call it, the 28 sites of terror, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1886.22s)]
*  they had no money for any of it. [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1891.06s)]
*  They had to do their own and focus on their own well-being. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1893.22s)]
*  And I hated to do it then, and I hate to do it just as much now. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1897.42s)]
*  And I say this, and I say this to Iran, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1902.34s)]
*  who is listening very intently, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1904.62s)]
*  I would love to be able to make a great deal, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1906.98s)]
*  a deal where you can get on with your lives [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1909.46s)]
*  and you'll do wonderfully. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1912.42s)]
*  You'll do wonderfully. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1914.98s)]
*  Incredible people. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1915.8600000000001s)]
*  Industrious, beautiful, just an unbelievable group of people in Iran. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1917.42s)]
*  And I know them well. [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1923.3400000000001s)]
*  I have many friends from Iran and many friends [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1924.14s)]
*  that are Americans from Iran, and they're very proud of Iran. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1926.9s)]
*  But I hated to do it, just so you understand. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1932.38s)]
*  And I hope we're going to be able to do something [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1935.5s)]
*  so that it doesn't end up in a very catastrophic situation. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1937.26s)]
*  I don't want to see that happen. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1942.18s)]
*  I want to see — I really want to see peace. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1943.6200000000001s)]
*  And I hope that we're able to do that. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1947.0600000000002s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1948.74s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1950.3000000000002s)]
*  I'm not putting restrictions. I'm not — they cannot have — [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1951.66s)]
*  one thing, they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1955.5800000000002s)]
*  And if I think that they will have a nuclear weapon, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1958.22s)]
*  despite what I just said, [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1961.26s)]
*  I think that's going to be very unfortunate for them. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1963.6200000000001s)]
*  If, on the other hand, they can convince us that they won't — [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1966.18s)]
*  and I hope they can. It's very easy to do. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1969.1000000000001s)]
*  It's actually very easy to do. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1971.02s)]
*  I think they're going to have an unbelievable future. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1973.3s)]
*  Yeah, please, sir. Go ahead. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1976.1s)]
*  The Press. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1977.7s)]
*  You just laid out your plan for Gaza. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1980.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1982.66s)]
*  Can you lay out your plan for Ukraine and also — [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1984.3s)]
*  For Ukraine. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1987.06s)]
*  For Ukraine, yes. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1987.9s)]
*  You consider yourself a strong leader. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1989.3s)]
*  You blamed your predecessor for letting Russia to take over Ukraine. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1992.1s)]
*  Will you demand from Putin to get out of Ukraine, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=1997.5s)]
*  from the sovereign territory of Ukraine? [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2000.9399999999998s)]
*  So, we're dealing right now on the subject. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2003.1399999999999s)]
*  I don't want to spend a lot of time because we're here for another reason. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2005.34s)]
*  But we are having very good talks, very constructive talks on Ukraine. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2007.6599999999999s)]
*  And we are talking to the Russians. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2012.86s)]
*  We're talking to the Ukrainian leadership. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2015.1799999999998s)]
*  It would have never happened. That would have never happened. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2018.7s)]
*  It should have never happened. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2021.1399999999999s)]
*  I get reports every week the number of soldiers — [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2023.06s)]
*  mostly soldiers now. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2025.58s)]
*  The cities have been largely demolished. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2026.8999999999999s)]
*  You talk about a very sad sight to see. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2029.7s)]
*  We talk Gaza. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2033.7s)]
*  Well, many of these cities look as bad as Gaza and worse. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2034.5s)]
*  What's happened to them? [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2038.6599999999999s)]
*  And I want to see that end. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2040.3s)]
*  And I want to see it end for one simple reason — [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2042.3799999999999s)]
*  the life of young people being absolutely obliterated on both sides. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2044.74s)]
*  You probably have 700,000 Ukrainian soldiers dead, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2049.38s)]
*  800,000, maybe more Russian soldiers dead. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2053.46s)]
*  It's very flat land. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2057.54s)]
*  And the only thing that's going to stop a bullet is the human body — [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2058.78s)]
*  in this case, usually soldiers. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2062.82s)]
*  And the numbers are staggering when you hear the real numbers in Ukraine — [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2065.38s)]
*  what the numbers are. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2068.62s)]
*  And this doesn't include the cities that have been demolished [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2070.34s)]
*  and all of the people that were killed. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2072.98s)]
*  So, I want to see it stopped. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2075.66s)]
*  We're having very good talks, and I think we're going to get it. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2076.9s)]
*  I think something will be — hopefully dramatically. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2079.3s)]
*  It will rise above everything. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2084.46s)]
*  You have to. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2086.94s)]
*  You can't let this continue. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2087.6200000000003s)]
*  You can't — this is an absolute slaughter [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2089.3s)]
*  that's taking place on the beautiful farmlands of Ukraine, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2092.42s)]
*  and we have to stop it. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2096.6200000000003s)]
*  We can't let this continue. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2097.9s)]
*  It's a human — it's a human — it is a human tragedy, [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2099.1400000000003s)]
*  and we're going to try very hard to stop it. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2104.86s)]
*  Yeah, please. Go ahead, sir. Go ahead. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2108.62s)]
*  Go ahead, baby. Go ahead. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2131.22s)]
*  I think the President just said something that I think [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2133.06s)]
*  is the pivot of everything that we're talking about. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2136.94s)]
*  He said Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2139.78s)]
*  and we fully agree with that. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2143.78s)]
*  If this goal can be achieved by a maximum-pressure campaign, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2145.34s)]
*  so be it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2149.14s)]
*  But I think the most important thing is to focus on the goal, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2150.58s)]
*  which the President just did, and I fully agree with him. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2154.98s)]
*  Well, I said it, and he said it very well. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2162.1800000000003s)]
*  It's a campaign of pressure [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2164.2599999999998s)]
*  to see if we can get something done. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2167.74s)]
*  He doesn't want to do what some people think [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2170.9s)]
*  will automatically happen, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2172.86s)]
*  because they're very difficult people to deal with, as you know. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2174.1s)]
*  But if we could solve this problem without warfare, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2178.5s)]
*  without all of the things that you've been witnessing [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2182.54s)]
*  over the last number of years, it would be — [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2185.54s)]
*  I think it would be a tremendous thing. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2187.62s)]
*  Go ahead, please. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2189.8999999999996s)]
*  To visit where? [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2197.8599999999997s)]
*  Oh, well, I love Israel. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2199.46s)]
*  I will visit there, and I'll visit Gaza, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2202.22s)]
*  and I'll visit Saudi Arabia, [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2204.3399999999997s)]
*  and I'll visit other places all over the Middle East. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2206.42s)]
*  The Middle East is an incredible place, so vibrant. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2209.18s)]
*  So it's just one of the really beautiful places [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2211.5s)]
*  with great people. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2217.2599999999998s)]
*  And I think a lot of bad leadership [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2218.78s)]
*  has taken place in the Middle East [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2221.5800000000004s)]
*  that's allowed this to happen. It's just terrible. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2223.3s)]
*  And that includes on the American side, by the way. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2225.5800000000004s)]
*  We should have never gone in there a long time ago, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2228.2200000000003s)]
*  spent trillions of dollars, and created so much death. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2231.34s)]
*  So it includes Americans. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2235.5s)]
*  But yeah, I'll be visiting a lot of different places [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2237.1400000000003s)]
*  in the Middle East. I've been invited everywhere, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2241.42s)]
*  but I will be visiting some. Yeah. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2243.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2245.6200000000003s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2247.4199999999996s)]
*  Kaitlin, go ahead. Kaitlin. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2249.4599999999996s)]
*  Kaitlin, go ahead. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2251.02s)]
*  Say it. Go ahead, please. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2252.66s)]
*  Just to follow up on what you were saying [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2255.06s)]
*  about the Dossens leaving Gaza, going to other countries. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2256.5s)]
*  One, where exactly are you suggesting that they should go? [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2259.7s)]
*  And two, are you saying they should return [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2262.66s)]
*  after it's rebuilt? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2264.3799999999997s)]
*  And if not, who do you envision living there? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2265.58s)]
*  I envision the world, people living there, the world's people. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2268.8199999999997s)]
*  I think you'll make that into an international, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2274.1s)]
*  unbelievable place. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2277.3s)]
*  I think the potential in the Gaza Strip is unbelievable. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2279.1s)]
*  And I think the entire world, representatives [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2283.02s)]
*  from all over the world will be there, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2285.42s)]
*  and they'll live there. Palestinians also. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2287.06s)]
*  Palestinians will live there. Many people will live there. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2290.3s)]
*  But they've tried the other, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2293.5s)]
*  and they've tried it for decades and decades and decades. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2295.54s)]
*  It's not going to work. It didn't work. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2298.98s)]
*  It will never work. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2300.62s)]
*  And you have to learn from history. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2302.3s)]
*  History has, you know, just can't let it keep repeating itself. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2305.78s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2309.5800000000004s)]
*  that could be phenomenal. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2311.7000000000003s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute. I don't want to be a wise guy. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2314.46s)]
*  But the Riviera of the Middle East, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2317.3s)]
*  this could be something that could be so bad. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2319.1800000000003s)]
*  This could be so magnificent. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2321.3s)]
*  But more importantly than that is the people [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2323.78s)]
*  that have been absolutely destroyed, [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2326.1000000000004s)]
*  that live there now, can live in peace [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2328.9s)]
*  in a much better situation because they're living in hell. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2330.86s)]
*  And those people will now be able to live in peace. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2335.6200000000003s)]
*  We'll make sure that it's done world class. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2337.86s)]
*  It'll be wonderful for the people. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2340.26s)]
*  Palestinians, Palestinians, mostly we're talking about. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2342.26s)]
*  And I have a feeling that despite them saying no, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2345.9s)]
*  I have a feeling that the king in Jordan [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2349.1800000000003s)]
*  and that the general president, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2351.6600000000003s)]
*  but that the general in Egypt will open their hearts [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2354.3s)]
*  and will give us the kind of land [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2358.26s)]
*  that we need to get this done [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2359.9s)]
*  and people can live in harmony and in peace. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2362.26s)]
*  Thank you all very much. Thank you. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZPhOx8-a_Js&t=2365.1800000000003s)]
