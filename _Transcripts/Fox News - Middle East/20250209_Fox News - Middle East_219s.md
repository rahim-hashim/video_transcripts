# Netanyahu calls out US education system's 'deranged, woke culture'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE)
*  I think the bulk of the American people from repeated surveys that I've seen, they get it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=0.0s)]
*  They get it. About 80% of them say they side with Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=6.2s)]
*  It's still unbelievable that 20% side with Hamas. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=10.0s)]
*  But that's the problem of your colleges, your elite universities. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=13.6s)]
*  I mean, they're unrecognizable. I went to one of them. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  I went to a good American high school. We both went to the same one. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Schelmham High School. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  That was a very good high school. I don't know what happened since. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  I think we had a third alumni. It's Reggie Jackson. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=28.799999999999997s)]
*  Reggie Jackson. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=32.8s)]
*  Reggie Jackson. So produced something. Produced something to Dax. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=33.8s)]
*  And I don't know about the two of us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=37.8s)]
*  But these were fine schools. And then I went to MIT, attended some courses in Harvard. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=39.2s)]
*  What happened? I mean, they've been poisoned with this anti-Semitism, with this anti-Americanism, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=44.8s)]
*  with this deranged, woke culture. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=54.199999999999996s)]
*  What is this? Get back. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  America, get back to where you represent the hopes and the prayers of most of humanity. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  Most of the people on earth understand that America is a force for good. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=71.2s)]
*  We certainly, we in Israel certainly understand that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=75.2s)]
*  And I think most Americans understand that about America. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=77.2s)]
*  And they understand that America has no greater ally than Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  Israel is America's greatest ally. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  America is clearly the greatest ally we have. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  But Israel is the greatest ally of America. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  We give America invaluable intelligence. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  And I'll tell you something. Not only that. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  I mean, we have some unbelievably fine technologists. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  And what we learn in the battlefield, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=103.60000000000001s)]
*  weapons that we develop, we share with our American brothers. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=107.0s)]
*  Here you have an ally that's willing to fight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=112.0s)]
*  We're fighting our fight, but in doing so we're defeating your enemies. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=116.0s)]
*  Our victory is your victory. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=119.0s)]
*  And we carry the load with our brave soldiers, our brave commanders, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=122.0s)]
*  our people that stand strong. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=128.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you, you go around the Middle East, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=132.0s)]
*  you know who are the greatest support? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=135.4s)]
*  I mean, the one country that is solidly pro-American is Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=138.4s)]
*  You know what the next country is? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=142.4s)]
*  There isn't one. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=144.4s)]
*  There is. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=145.4s)]
*  Which? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=146.4s)]
*  It's called Iran. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=147.4s)]
*  But people of Iran are yearning for the day when that regime is finished. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=148.4s)]
*  And when they can express their support, not only for America, but for Israel. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=153.4s)]
*  You know, I do these videos every few months. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=159.4s)]
*  I do a video for the people of Iran. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=161.4s)]
*  I speak to them, you know, broadcast it to Iraq. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=163.8s)]
*  You know how many views we get? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=167.8s)]
*  Millions. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=169.8s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=170.8s)]
*  Millions. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=171.8s)]
*  And some of them respond. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=172.8s)]
*  I couldn't believe this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=173.8s)]
*  They respond with their names and they're so frustrated. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=174.8s)]
*  You know, they just throw caution to the winds because they hate this regime. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=177.8s)]
*  They want to see a different world. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=182.8s)]
*  And if you, by cutting the Iran axis down to size, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=184.8s)]
*  by preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=187.8s)]
*  we're giving a new hope of freedom, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  not only to us and to our Arab neighbors, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  but also to the people of Iran. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  And that's the, you know, the whole thing changes [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  when Israel and America see eye to eye [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  and when there's no daylight between us, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  endless possibilities. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Os_6a3f2PE&t=204.20000000000002s)]
