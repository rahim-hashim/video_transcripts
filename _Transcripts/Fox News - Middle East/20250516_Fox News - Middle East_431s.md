# BREAKING: Trump confirms U.S.-Iran nuclear deal proposal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U)
*  To a Fox News alert right now, President Donald Trump is heading back to the United States [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=0.0s)]
*  after wrapping up his historic trip to the Middle East. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=4.0s)]
*  And the Commander in Chief breaking some news while flying home onboard Air Force One, revealing [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=7.22s)]
*  the U.S. has given Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=12.200000000000001s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=15.8s)]
*  Lucas Thomason joins us from Abu Dhabi with the latest. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=16.8s)]
*  Lucas, what do we know about the deal? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=19.68s)]
*  Well, Lawrence, that's right. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=22.8s)]
*  President Trump making news aboard Air Force One, departing the United Arab Emirates moments [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=25.94s)]
*  ago, concluding his three-nation swing here in the Middle East. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  The President is confirming that the U.S. has given Iran a proposal for a nuclear deal. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=34.02s)]
*  We still don't know the details of that, but here's the quote from the President moments [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=39.06s)]
*  ago. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=42.86s)]
*  He said, they have a proposal, speaking about Iran, but more importantly, they know they [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=43.86s)]
*  have to move quickly or something bad is going to happen. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=48.540000000000006s)]
*  And part of that bad going to happen is right here in the United Arab Emirates, where the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=52.260000000000005s)]
*  United States keeps some of its fast moves, F-15s, F-16s. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=55.38s)]
*  Let's talk about the good news this trip. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=59.34s)]
*  Commerce, not conflict. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=61.46s)]
*  That's been the President's theme, and we have the receipts right here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=62.940000000000005s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, first stop on this trip, pledging over $600 billion in U.S. investment. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=66.3s)]
*  Qatar is pledging $243.5 billion, as well as that $747 billion and freeing Edan Alexander. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=71.94s)]
*  And right here in Abu Dhabi, the UAE capital, the Emiratis are pledging $200 billion in [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=79.1s)]
*  commercial deals. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=84.46000000000001s)]
*  And they also said that's going to go to $1.4 trillion over the next decade. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=85.78s)]
*  And let's not forget the captains of industry, the business leaders that have come here to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=90.38s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=93.98s)]
*  They didn't have to. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=94.98s)]
*  And last night, UAE's foreign minister sat down with their own Brett Baer about what [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=95.98s)]
*  the President's visit meant to his country. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=99.66s)]
*  We've been investing in the United States for decades, but now we're taking it one step [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=102.9s)]
*  further, not only in terms of size, but in terms of trust. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=106.78s)]
*  And we're grateful for President Trump for that. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=112.14s)]
*  After arriving yesterday in the UAE capital, Trump touring the Grand Mosque with his shoes [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=117.42s)]
*  on, the President of the UAE closing the mosque for the first time ever, guys. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=121.98s)]
*  Now there are other international issues looming. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=126.18s)]
*  Of course, it's Iran. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=128.46s)]
*  Last night on Handley, Secretary of State Marco Rubio talked to Sean about Iran, not [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=129.98s)]
*  far from where I'm standing, about a potential deal of its nuclear program. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=133.66s)]
*  He says this offer won't be around forever. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=138.38s)]
*  What he means by that is at some point, decisions will have to be made about more maximum pressure [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=140.58s)]
*  and other options because Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=145.34s)]
*  So it's really Secretary of State Marco Rubio confirming to Sean Hannity that that offer [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=148.74s)]
*  had been proposed, saying this offer won't be around forever. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=154.94s)]
*  Now, here's the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa lit up in the stars and stripes, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=157.9s)]
*  a symbol of unity and solidarity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=162.26000000000002s)]
*  One more image, Trump earlier today visiting the Abrahamic House that's home to a church, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  synagogue and mosque, which speaks to the tolerance of this country, including co-ed [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=169.86s)]
*  gyms here at the hotel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=173.74s)]
*  A different story, though, across the Persian Gulf and Iran. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=174.74s)]
*  Here's President Trump earlier from UAE. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=177.86s)]
*  ...five billion dollar trade surplus for the U.S. last year, making us the third-largest [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=179.86s)]
*  in the world. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=185.86s)]
*  And then... [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=187.86s)]
*  I should have left yesterday, but I couldn't disappoint you. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=188.86s)]
*  Your father would have been extremely upset with me and you would have been more upset. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=192.02s)]
*  He would have understood. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  We had such a beautiful evening and they planned it so beautifully. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=199.38s)]
*  I said, I'm going to have to wait just a little bit. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=202.78s)]
*  But the way we were treated by your family, the way we were treated by Qatar, Saudi Arabia [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=206.14s)]
*  and others has just been so... [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=216.06s)]
*  I'm very proud to be representing the United States of America. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=218.5s)]
*  And thank you all for being here. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=222.7s)]
*  And Media, thank you very much. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=224.04s)]
*  You've been very fair. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=225.54s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=226.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=227.54s)]
*  So the President there talking about the full diplomatic and military honors he's received, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=229.54s)]
*  not only here in the United Arab Emirates, but also in Saudi Arabia and in Qatar. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=236.94s)]
*  We remember the F-15s escorting Air Force One not only to Saudi Arabia, but again to [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=241.22s)]
*  Qatar and then respectively from their countries here, the United Arab Emirates. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=247.62s)]
*  And we just saw fighter jets escorting Air Force One out of the UAE, but full diplomatic [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=251.38s)]
*  and military honors, full pomp and circumstance wherever the President goes, bestowing honors, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=257.1s)]
*  very rare honors that these leaders could muster and have ever given out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=261.98s)]
*  And no question the success, the business success, commerce, not conflict. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=266.06s)]
*  That's been the theme of this trip as the President wraps up his first official overseas [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=270.06s)]
*  trip since beginning his second term here, not only to the United Arab Emirates, but [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=273.76s)]
*  also Saudi Arabia and Qatar, guys. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=278.38s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  What a great trip. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=282.82s)]
*  Thank you so much, Lucas. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=283.82s)]
*  You get to come home soon. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=286.74s)]
*  This is the cover of the New York Post this morning. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=287.74s)]
*  It says, shake it up. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=289.06s)]
*  And in this little box, it says, President Trump announced nearly two trillion in deals [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=290.38s)]
*  with Mideast countries, lifted sanctions on Syria, pushed for a new Iran deal, an onslaught [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=293.3s)]
*  that left some former Biden officials jealous. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=297.82s)]
*  Quote, it's amazing what can be accomplished when the President isn't brain dead, one said. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=300.18s)]
*  And the breakdown is just extensive. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=305.1s)]
*  When you look at 200 billion plus in commercial deals between the U.S. and the UAE, then you [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=307.18s)]
*  got 243 billion in economic deals between the U.S. and Qatar. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=312.58s)]
*  And then you got 600 billion committed from Saudi Arabia to invest in the United States. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=318.38s)]
*  And one thing that they're doing differently than they did the last time is they're making [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=323.46s)]
*  sure it's happening in the four-year period. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=327.78s)]
*  The President is aware of what happened the last time, where he got out of office and [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=330.14s)]
*  then people didn't keep their commitments. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  He's trying to get the ink there dry and say, hey, you got to do this timely and very [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=336.38s)]
*  quickly. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=342.54s)]
*  And, Brian, look at that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=343.54s)]
*  That's what he accomplished in a matter of a few days. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=344.54s)]
*  That's jobs. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=347.06s)]
*  When I see that, I see all these deals. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=348.06s)]
*  Those are jobs here in America. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=349.98s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=351.46000000000004s)]
*  And they are going to build, they're looking to get a lot of power because they want to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  develop AI. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=355.06s)]
*  And with them, they had the who's who of AI executives with them from Elon Musk to Sam [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=356.18s)]
*  Altman, really conducted by David Sacks, who's well connected in the area. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=361.06s)]
*  And they have a lot of defense contracts. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=365.66s)]
*  I thought it was fascinating. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=367.02000000000004s)]
*  In Saudi Arabia, they're going to spend, they want 600 billion worth of defense. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=368.02000000000004s)]
*  And they're spending the contracts across various companies to make sure they get it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=372.98s)]
*  So I just wonder if that helps Secretary Hegson's budget. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=377.14s)]
*  So if he's trying to get a trillion, OK. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=380.74s)]
*  But if he's selling a lot of it, shouldn't those profits go to, I don't know, maybe allowing [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=382.7s)]
*  them to work it against the invoices in order to get that trillion? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=389.86s)]
*  You sell off, you can make a profit from this at the same time. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=396.02s)]
*  We build up our defense. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=399.02s)]
*  Meanwhile, Marco Rubio is making it clear. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8x1TxjfK3U&t=400.18s)]
