# 'DIRE CONSEQUENCES': KT McFarland sends ceasefire warning to Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg)
*  All right, welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, U.S. special envoy to the Middle East, Steve Witkoff, rejecting Hamas' response to [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=1.32s)]
*  a ceasefire proposal is, quote, totally unacceptable. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=5.76s)]
*  He's warning the terror group to accept the U.S.-backed plan that Israel has already agreed [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=9.6s)]
*  to. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=14.44s)]
*  But Hamas, they're demanding a permanent ceasefire rather than just a 60-day pause. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=15.44s)]
*  They also want Israeli troops to fully withdraw from Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=20.78s)]
*  For more on this, we're going to bring in former Trump deputy national security adviser [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=24.84s)]
*  KT McFarland. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  KT, good morning to you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=29.159999999999997s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=30.4s)]
*  Thanks for coming on. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=31.4s)]
*  Let's go into what Steve Witkoff posted on X last night. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=32.4s)]
*  If we can pull that up right now, he's not happy with Hamas changing the terms here. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=35.36s)]
*  He says, quote, I received the Hamas response to the United States proposal. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=39.68s)]
*  It is totally unacceptable and only takes us backward. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  Hamas should accept the framework proposal we put forward as the basis for proximity [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  talks. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=51.72s)]
*  So, shocker, this terror group has apparently changed the terms of the deal last minute. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=52.72s)]
*  Now it looks like that deal is at risk. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=58.08s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=60.12s)]
*  Well, that's exactly how Hamas negotiates, right? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=61.12s)]
*  They just want to string the process along. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  As President Trump says, they're just tapping us along, whether it's Hamas, whether it's [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=67.88s)]
*  Iran, whether it's Putin and Russia, that they think that if they can just continue [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=72.75999999999999s)]
*  to string these negotiations out, the United States will either get tired of it or give [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=77.72s)]
*  them everything they want or nothing really happens, at which point, you know, Hamas is [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  still in charge? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=86.75999999999999s)]
*  Putin is still in charge? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=88.08s)]
*  Ukraine is still occupied? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=89.68s)]
*  Iran is still building a snooks? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  It's the same story in all three of these groups. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=93.08000000000001s)]
*  And the problem with it is, is President Trump doesn't think that process is progress. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=95.76s)]
*  And unless there is progress and he's got a calendar in his mind, unless there's progress [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=101.36s)]
*  by a certain point in the next couple of weeks, maybe a month or two, then there are [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=105.68s)]
*  dire consequences Hamas is going to pay. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=110.72s)]
*  You know, Israel, President Trump has always said Israel just finished the job. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  Well, if Israel finishes the job, it finishes Hamas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=116.92s)]
*  The problem always has been with Gaza, Bill, is what comes next? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=120.04s)]
*  Once you get rid of Hamas, what comes next? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=123.76s)]
*  If there's an election, the people are just as likely to elect Hamas again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=125.92s)]
*  Yeah. And the Trump administration is kind of trying to thread a needle here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=129.44s)]
*  They're trying to broker this deal between Israel and Hamas, while at the same time, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=132.16s)]
*  they're trying to cut a deal with Iran in terms of their nuclear program. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=136.88s)]
*  But according to reports, Iran is enriching uranium as these talks are continuing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=141.36s)]
*  Take a look at this statement right here or this graphic right here, which kind of explains [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=148.16s)]
*  what's going on with Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=151.88s)]
*  Apparently, as these talks are going on, they've been working on the uranium. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=153.68s)]
*  Here's Caroline Levitt reacting to that, saying in part, quote, President Trump has [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=157.32s)]
*  made it clear that Iran can never obtain a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=161.56s)]
*  Special Envoy Witkoff has sent a detailed and acceptable proposal to the Iranian regime [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=165.2s)]
*  and it's in their best interest to accept it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=170.56s)]
*  So, KT, as these reports emerge that Iran is enriching all this uranium, as these talks [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=173.04s)]
*  are going on, you know Donald Trump. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=178.84s)]
*  How do you think he's going to react to that? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=181.36s)]
*  He's going to run out of patience. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=184.68s)]
*  You know, he said Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=186.0s)]
*  So what Iran is trying to say is, OK, OK, we're just going to have enriched uranium [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=188.76s)]
*  and use it for civilian purposes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  And the problem with it is, is the way you enrich uranium is called a centrifuge. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=195.76s)]
*  Think of a salad spinner, Bill. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=200.4s)]
*  You spin the salad spinner a little ways and you get low enriched uranium. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=202.23999999999998s)]
*  That's what you use for civilian reactors. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=206.23999999999998s)]
*  You keep spinning that salad spinner and you got highly enriched uranium. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=208.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's what's used in a bomb. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  So President Trump has always said, you got to get rid of the centrifuges, otherwise we [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=213.92s)]
*  can't trust you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  And we're going to in any event, whatever happens with this deal, we've got to verify [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=219.28s)]
*  everything we're doing. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=224.04s)]
*  And so Iran, again, trying to process along, tap it along while they're at the mean time, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=225.28s)]
*  trying to develop nuclear weapons so that then they can just announce, oh, well, too [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=230.0s)]
*  late. We don't need negotiations. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=233.88s)]
*  We already have nukes. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=235.16s)]
*  Yeah. And during Trump's first term, he took out General Soleimani. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=236.4s)]
*  So I think the Iranians know he's not going to be messing around with any threats he [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=239.52s)]
*  makes. KT McFarland. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=242.44s)]
*  Great to see you. Thanks for coming on this morning. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=243.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nk8rzLW3QQg&t=246.72s)]
