# Tucker slams 'chest-beaters' cheering US strike on Soleimani
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM)
*  Good evening and welcome to Tucker Carlson tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=0.0s)]
*  Yesterday, as you know, an American airstrike killed an Iranian general called Qasem Soleimani. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=3.2s)]
*  For the past 21 years, Soleimani commanded the Quds Force, which is responsible for paramilitary [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=9.16s)]
*  operations outside the national borders of Iran. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=14.4s)]
*  In that role, Soleimani was believed to be a patron of the Shia militias that regularly [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=18.0s)]
*  attacked American troops during the Iraq War. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=22.16s)]
*  He was also a major player in Syria during their civil war, as well as in the campaign against ISIS. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=25.4s)]
*  Though he was little known to the American public, Soleimani was among the most famous [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=31.6s)]
*  living figures in Iran and also among the most powerful, according to some accounts, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=35.6s)]
*  second only to the supreme leader of that country. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=39.6s)]
*  The Iranian government has already vowed to extract what it has called forceful revenge [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=42.6s)]
*  against the U.S. in response to his death. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=47.0s)]
*  Now, whether that will happen and what form it might take remains to be seen. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=49.8s)]
*  But it's no exaggeration to say that by the next time this show airs, we could be engaged [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=53.4s)]
*  in a conflict, a real conflict, with Iran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=58.5s)]
*  From Iran's perspective, we're already there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=61.5s)]
*  If Iranian forces killed the chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff, for example, would [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=64.0s)]
*  you consider it an act of war? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=68.0s)]
*  You would. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=69.9s)]
*  So what happened yesterday wasn't just another symbolic bombing sortie of the kind we've [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=70.9s)]
*  seen in Syria. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=75.3s)]
*  It was a pivot point. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=76.5s)]
*  Neocons in Washington understood that immediately. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=78.0s)]
*  Congratulations to all involved in eliminating Qassem Soleimani, tweeted disgraced former [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=81.1s)]
*  national security adviser John Bolton. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=85.69999999999999s)]
*  Hope this is the first step to regime change in Tehran. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=87.89999999999999s)]
*  End quote. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=91.3s)]
*  That, of course, has been the Neocon objective all along. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=92.3s)]
*  The president, though, has for years opposed that objective and in a statement said that [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=95.6s)]
*  regime change and war are not the point at all. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=100.8s)]
*  We took action last night to stop a war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=105.1s)]
*  We did not take action to start a war. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=110.1s)]
*  We do not seek regime change. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=114.1s)]
*  However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region, including the use of proxy fighters [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=115.8s)]
*  to destabilize its neighbors, must end and it must end now. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=122.3s)]
*  If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets already fully identified [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=126.4s)]
*  and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=134.2s)]
*  According to the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, meanwhile, Soleimani was killed to first all [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=140.0s)]
*  planned attacks on Americans. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  But as he later conceded, those attacks would have occurred in the Middle East, not here [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=148.2s)]
*  in America. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=152.0s)]
*  President Trump's decision to remove Qassem Soleimani from the battlefield saved American [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=154.1s)]
*  lives. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=158.4s)]
*  There's no doubt about that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=159.4s)]
*  He was actively plotting in the region to take actions, a big action as he described [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=160.7s)]
*  it that would have put dozens, if not hundreds of American lives at risk. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=165.0s)]
*  And last night was the time that we needed to strike to make sure that this imminent [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=168.7s)]
*  attack that he was working actively was disrupted. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=172.0s)]
*  Was there any imminent threat to the U.S. homeland? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  These were threats that were located in the region. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=180.4s)]
*  Threats in the region. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  If you don't live in Washington, here's the translation. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=186.29999999999998s)]
*  That would be in hostile Middle Eastern countries, places where American troops would never be [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=189.0s)]
*  in the first place, were it not for the insistent demands of non-geniuses like Max Boot and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=193.2s)]
*  John Bolton. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=197.3s)]
*  But never mind. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=198.3s)]
*  No one in Washington is in mood for big picture questions right now, questions, the obvious [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=199.3s)]
*  ones, like is Iran really the greatest threat we face and who's actually benefiting from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=203.3s)]
*  this and why are we continuing to ignore the decline of our own country in favor of jumping [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=207.9s)]
*  into another quagmire from which there is no obvious exit. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=212.46s)]
*  By the way, if we're still in Afghanistan 19 years sad years later, what makes us think [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=215.2s)]
*  there's a quick way out of Iran and so on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=220.2s)]
*  Nobody is thinking like that right now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=222.2s)]
*  Instead, chest beaters like Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska are making the usual warlike noises, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  the ones they always make. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=230.0s)]
*  This is very simple. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=231.5s)]
*  Ben Sasse wrote in a statement last night. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=233.2s)]
*  General Soleimani is dead because he was an evil bastard who murdered Americans, which [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=235.5s)]
*  is essentially true. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=241.5s)]
*  Soleimani was certainly a bad guy, but does that make killing him quote very simple? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=242.9s)]
*  It does not. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=248.8s)]
*  Nothing about life and certainly nothing about killing is ever very simple and any politician [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=249.8s)]
*  who tells you otherwise is dumb or is lying. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=254.4s)]
*  Yes, Soleimani was linked to the deaths of Americans. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=257.8s)]
*  Nobody mourns his passing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=260.7s)]
*  But Mexico and China are also linked to the deaths of Americans. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=262.6s)]
*  Each has flooded our country with narcotics from which tens of thousands of Americans [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=265.9s)]
*  die every single year, not that anyone in power cares. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=270.3s)]
*  So does that mean we get to bomb Oaxaca? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=273.9s)]
*  Can we start assassinating generals in the People's Liberation Army? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=276.2s)]
*  Maybe, maybe Ben Sasse will call for that too. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=279.5s)]
*  He's a former consultant, a very tough character. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=281.7s)]
*  But before we enter into a single new war, there's a criterion that ought to be met. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=284.2s)]
*  Our leaders should explain to us how that conflict will make the United States richer [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=288.7s)]
*  and more secure. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=293.0s)]
*  There are an awful lot of bad people in this world. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=294.8s)]
*  We can't kill them all. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=297.2s)]
*  It's not our job. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=298.7s)]
*  Instead, our government exists to defend and promote the interests of American citizens, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=300.1s)]
*  period. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=304.3s)]
*  That's why we have a government. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=304.8s)]
*  So has the killing of Soleimani done that? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=306.70000000000005s)]
*  Maybe. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  No one in Washington has explained how. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=310.8s)]
*  Instead, like Ben Sasse, they're telling us what an awful person he was. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=313.5s)]
*  He clearly was. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  So that's irrelevant. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's pretty clear that things could start to move in the wrong direction pretty quickly. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  We're praying they don't, but they could. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=325.40000000000003s)]
*  How do we know that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=327.70000000000005s)]
*  Because we've seen it before. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=328.3s)]
*  We fought quite a number of wars around the Middle East in recent decades. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=329.9s)]
*  We attacked Saddam Hussein twice, as you know. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=333.09999999999997s)]
*  In the end, we killed him. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=334.9s)]
*  We invaded and occupied Afghanistan. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=336.2s)]
*  We toppled Muammar Qaddafi in Libya. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=337.9s)]
*  We fought ISIS in Syria, and then for some reason stuck around. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=340.4s)]
*  We're still there. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  We joined humanitarian missions in Lebanon and Somalia. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=344.79999999999995s)]
*  Our special forces have been quietly fighting in Yemen, Pakistan, Niger. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=347.7s)]
*  Who knows where else? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=351.29999999999995s)]
*  Many other places. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=352.4s)]
*  In every single place, each of these conflicts has turned out to be longer and bloodier and [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=353.9s)]
*  more expensive than we were promised in the first place. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=359.0s)]
*  The benefits? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=361.5s)]
*  Often they've been non-existent. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=362.5s)]
*  A lot of lectures about how the people were killing deserve to die. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=364.3s)]
*  Certainly they did. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=368.0s)]
*  Hope that makes you feel better. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=368.9s)]
*  What do the American people think about all of this? [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=370.8s)]
*  Not that anyone cares. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=373.3s)]
*  It was too soon, strictly speaking, to know the killing of Soleimani happened just last night. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=374.8s)]
*  But just five months ago, after months of supposed Iranian provocation, Americans didn't [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=379.9s)]
*  Iran as a major concern. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=386.5s)]
*  Not even close. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=388.0s)]
*  In a Gallup poll taken last August, just 18% of Americans said that they backed military [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=389.0s)]
*  force to shut down Iran's nuclear program. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=394.3s)]
*  78% said they prefer diplomacy and economic sanctions alone. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=397.7s)]
*  So in a democracy, you'd think this would matter. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=402.0s)]
*  But as is so often the case, the preferences of actual Americans don't enter the equation [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlcsuJtXYkM&t=404.8s)]
