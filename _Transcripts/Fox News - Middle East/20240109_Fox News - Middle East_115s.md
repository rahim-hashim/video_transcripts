# Fears mount over Iran’s growing nuclear clout
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44)
*  While the Iranian nuclear program has suddenly been put on steroids, the UN nuclear watchdog [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=0.0s)]
*  agency finds that Tehran has increased its production of near bomb grade uranium. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=5.48s)]
*  And Iran now has enough fuel for several nuclear bombs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=10.64s)]
*  This is shocking information. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=14.6s)]
*  Greg Palacat live in London. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=15.92s)]
*  Hi Greg. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=17.88s)]
*  Hi Denny. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=18.88s)]
*  Yeah, Iran is making trouble on several fronts these days. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=19.88s)]
*  One of the most dangerous according to experts now that potential nuclear weapon threat. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=22.8s)]
*  Iran proxies busy, Hamas at war with Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=29.88s)]
*  Hezbollah hitting from Lebanon, militias attacking US troops, Yemen's Houthi striking ships. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=33.96s)]
*  And according to various accounts, Iran is revving up its nuclear program. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=39.2s)]
*  Experts say its output of close to bomb grade uranium is upped three times. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=43.76s)]
*  Within a few weeks if wanted, Iran could have enough for at least three nuclear bombs. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=48.36s)]
*  The Trump administration pulled out of a deal trying to rein in Iran in 2018. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Last year's prisoner exchange and freeing of funds by the Biden administration reportedly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=56.84s)]
*  sought to tamp down Tehran's nukes, but that's said to be dead now. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  So far, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei has not pulled the nuclear trigger and UN [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=64.52000000000001s)]
*  inspectors are pushing for access. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  But if Iran goes further, analysts worry about the nuclear clout the regime could wield. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  It becomes a fact to be dealt with because they suddenly have this literally trump card [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=75.36s)]
*  that they can play and decimate their neighbors. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=79.84s)]
*  The question is what to do about a nuclear Iran. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=84.04s)]
*  Some are calling for a new Iran nuke deal that's seemingly a non-starter. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=87.76s)]
*  There have been assassinations of nuclear scientists, bugs inserted in planned computers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Analysts say strength in dealing with Iran is crucial now or it could act up worse than [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=95.64s)]
*  anything we're seeing right now in the region. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=100.92s)]
*  Data. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qQaL-IqHj44&t=103.28s)]
