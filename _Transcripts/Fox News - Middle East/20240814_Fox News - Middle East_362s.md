# Mike Pompeo: 'We're living in a very dangerous time - who's in charge?'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw)
*  What an unusual situation we're in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=0.0s)]
*  Obviously, this is the current president of the United States, Joe Biden. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  So much of the focus now is on his vice president, Kamala Harris, who is running to replace him [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=7.32s)]
*  after he dropped out just a few short weeks ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=12.72s)]
*  We don't get that many opportunities to hear from him in recent days, but there he was [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=16.42s)]
*  on the tarmac, taking a few questions. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=20.56s)]
*  He was asked about the push by Ukrainian forces into Russia, and he said that he's being briefed [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=22.34s)]
*  on that every four or five hours and that it has put Russia in a difficult position. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=29.44s)]
*  He was also asked about the, we're told, imminent attack by Iran into Israel, and he said he's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=36.4s)]
*  watching that very closely and that he's still hopeful. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=42.6s)]
*  I take that to mean that he's still hopeful that there could be a ceasefire situation [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  that would be helpful to ending the war in Israel, between Israel and Gaza, which he [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=50.3s)]
*  has wanted for some time, and the return of U.S. hostages. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=58.54s)]
*  So with that, let's bring in Mike Pompeo, former secretary of state and CIA director, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=62.02s)]
*  now a Fox News contributor. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=65.66s)]
*  Iran put a $1 million bounty on Mike Pompeo's head, and the Biden administration renewed [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=67.7s)]
*  his security protection earlier this year in that situation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=72.74s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, always good to see you, sir. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=79.14s)]
*  I guess what strikes me, I want to talk to you about Iran and their meddling in U.S. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=80.94s)]
*  politics, which now is a U.S. intelligence concern of high order. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=86.14s)]
*  But your reaction as we look at this very unusual situation where the president of the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=90.3s)]
*  United States is really in the backseat now to his vice president who is running for office, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=94.41999999999999s)]
*  and he gets questioned on some very big issues that are pressing on the White House. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=99.82s)]
*  Yeah, Martha, it's a very dangerous time. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=104.86s)]
*  Our adversaries are watching this too. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  Like, who's in charge? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=111.02s)]
*  Who's running American national security? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=112.78s)]
*  Who's making the decisions about whether to send the increased weaponry that we've now [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=114.60000000000001s)]
*  sent to the Middle East? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=119.28s)]
*  The Ukrainians have now advanced into Russia. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=121.28s)]
*  President Biden says it put Russia at risk. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=123.36s)]
*  But of course, his policy always told the Ukrainians not to do that, and now they have. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=124.76s)]
*  When he says don't, no one seems to be listening because I don't think the world believes that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=129.6s)]
*  America is leading on the world stage. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=134.12s)]
*  And that's dangerous not just for Ukraine or Europe. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=136.0s)]
*  It's not just dangerous for Israel. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=138.64000000000001s)]
*  It's dangerous for the United States of America too. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=140.12s)]
*  We've got soldiers, sailors, airmen and marines all across the world that are now under increased [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  risk because our chain of command, our leadership model is greatly challenged because we've [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=146.64s)]
*  got a president who has demonstrated he is incapable of deterring our adversaries. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=151.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, who do you think these other leaders believe is in charge right now? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=156.11999999999998s)]
*  The leadership in Iran, in Israel, in Ukraine, in Russia. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=160.32s)]
*  How do you think they see all this? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=164.64s)]
*  Yeah, they see it as a tag team. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=166.48s)]
*  A coalition of people all coming together. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=171.16s)]
*  There's no decision maker. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=173.2s)]
*  There's no true commander in chief who's actually executing, taking on this information, making [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=174.88s)]
*  decisions, giving directives. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=180.07999999999998s)]
*  And they see that as a green light. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=181.96s)]
*  So the risk in Israel tonight is much greater because the United States doesn't have that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=184.04s)]
*  clear chain of command, right? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=188.92s)]
*  It's this whole idea of a unitary executive who's making decisions, who's taking the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=190.28s)]
*  information on board and getting it right for America and for our friends and allies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=194.12s)]
*  They see that when the crisis hits, there'll be a situation room meeting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=197.68s)]
*  That's a dangerous thing to do. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=202.92000000000002s)]
*  You need to know in advance. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=204.6s)]
*  Here's what we're going to do in response to whatever it is they do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=205.72s)]
*  And I can't imagine that inside the Biden White House today, there is a clear delineation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=208.52s)]
*  and our adversaries see this as a green light, Martha. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=212.44s)]
*  Well, the pressure on Harris from the left is to reevaluate sending arms at all to Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  And we just showed on the board the tremendous presence that the U.S. military has there [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=222.08s)]
*  now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=226.08s)]
*  In your first response, you were talking about munitions and sending what Israel needs to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=227.12s)]
*  for itself, to defend itself right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=232.0s)]
*  You know, what did you think of her answer on that, that she was open to talking to these [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=234.68s)]
*  protesters about that? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=239.24s)]
*  You know, it's remarkable to watch the vice president on the campaign trail talk about [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  bringing in progressives to the national security establishment. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=246.12s)]
*  You need hard people running your deterrent strategy. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=250.02s)]
*  You need hard people protecting America. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=253.12s)]
*  We need hard people ensuring that you have American sovereignty and demonstrating the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=254.8s)]
*  very model of America that allowed us to deter these bad guys, the Russians, the Iranians [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=259.2s)]
*  for four years. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=263.8s)]
*  When you demonstrate weakness, Martha, you get precisely what you see today. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=265.36s)]
*  The Chinese Communist Party, the Iranians, the Russians, all working in our elections [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=269.0s)]
*  and against our friends around the world. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=273.56s)]
*  And our friends are saying, is America really going to be with them? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=275.78000000000003s)]
*  And sadly, the evidence to date is that we are not. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=278.12s)]
*  We're not going to do the things that support them so they can defend themselves. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=280.84s)]
*  So Iran obviously, you know, has preferred the Biden-Harris model of, you know, let's [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=285.47999999999996s)]
*  reopen the nuclear weapons negotiations and the deal that was overturned by the Trump [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=297.96s)]
*  And now we're hearing U.S. intel sources by, according to reporting in The Wall Street [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=298.96s)]
*  Journal, saying that that up until just a few weeks ago, they felt that Russia posed [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=302.7s)]
*  the greatest threat in terms of manipulation in our U.S. election process. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=307.22s)]
*  Now they say Iran has surpassed that. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=311.98s)]
*  Iran is getting very involved in social media protests, all of these sort of things that [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=314.74s)]
*  sort of soft influence elections in a very real, significant way, potentially. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=320.82000000000005s)]
*  Yes, Martha, Iran is very capable. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=327.86s)]
*  They have the capacity to do precisely the kinds of things the Russians do. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=331.02000000000004s)]
*  We saw the reports of the hack of the Trump campaign. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=335.1s)]
*  We should expect this to continue because there's been no cost imposed on the Iranian [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  regime for any of their malign activity. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=345.1s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, always good to talk to you, sir. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=347.3s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=350.5s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=351.5s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=352.5s)]
*  We'll talk to you soon. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4gEgOshNuw&t=353.5s)]
