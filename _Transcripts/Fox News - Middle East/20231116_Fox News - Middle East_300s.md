# The Biden administration hasn't 'deterred anything': Pete Hegseth
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E)
*  Six Capitol police officers injured in a clash with violent anti-Israel protesters outside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=0.0s)]
*  of the DNC headquarters, forcing Democratic lawmakers to evacuate as the House offices [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  were all put on lockdown. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Fox and Friends Weekend co-host Pete Hegseth here to react. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=13.92s)]
*  Pete. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that's indicative of the state of the Democrat Party as it pertains to support [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  for Israel or not. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=24.5s)]
*  I mean, you've seen bipartisan support. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=25.76s)]
*  You saw Democrats show up at that rally. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=27.48s)]
*  The pro-Israel rally on the National Mall. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=29.52s)]
*  But the base of the Democrat Party, the activist base who drive a lot of the energy, they're [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=32.28s)]
*  with the Hamas caucus. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=37.879999999999995s)]
*  They're with the squad. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=39.72s)]
*  They're with Rashida Tlaib. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=41.12s)]
*  They have a totally different narrative and belief about Israel, but also about the United [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=43.04s)]
*  States of America. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=48.28s)]
*  You saw, you don't see any American flags flying at the pro-Hamas Palestinian rally. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=49.28s)]
*  It'll trigger them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=53.64s)]
*  They would burn them, is what their view would be. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=55.2s)]
*  So ultimately, this is a crew that thinks that even this administration, which has [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=57.32s)]
*  not been great in their support for Israel, but at least they have given them the rope [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=61.04s)]
*  to do something about it, says, no, we don't want any support. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=65.12s)]
*  We want from the river to the sea. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=67.84s)]
*  And they're willing to confront Capitol Police in the process. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=69.44s)]
*  Explain why, and I understand that people with good intentions have tried to both sides [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=71.92s)]
*  the conflict. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Explain why this damaging, because the other side, they don't want peace. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=79.12s)]
*  They don't want peace. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=83.72s)]
*  And the people that are parading in the street, they may say the Palestinian people, but when [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=85.24s)]
*  you go deep into their organization and structure, they support Hamas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  They do. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  And that's why what's happened since October 7th is so revealing. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  You don't have to go back to ancient history to understand that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=97.91999999999999s)]
*  Go back to the history of just modern Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  Every time land has been given for peace under the pretense of we're going to have a two-state [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=103.8s)]
*  solution or we're going to have a Palestinian authority, that eventually leads to a terror [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=108.39999999999999s)]
*  state on the border of Israel. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=114.02s)]
*  Because the Islamists have captured the talk on the street. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=115.02s)]
*  We saw the same thing in Iraq and Afghanistan in multiple different contexts. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=118.1s)]
*  They take over and drive the narrative, and ultimately you end up having a fight. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=122.02s)]
*  I'm very curious to see if you took Iran out of this picture and that government ever changes [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=125.3s)]
*  and moderates. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=130.42s)]
*  How many problems go away? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=131.62s)]
*  Well, I think a lot of them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=133.34s)]
*  I mean, billions of dollars worth of problems. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=134.94s)]
*  And that's why I've said from the beginning, I think this is a moment for the Israeli government, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=137.98s)]
*  not the U.S. government, the Israeli government, to take action against Iran to prevent an [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=142.66s)]
*  Iranian bomb. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=147.46s)]
*  Because the West has said forever, we can't have Tehran, we can't have the mullahs with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=148.46s)]
*  a nuclear shield. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=153.14s)]
*  Imagine what this conflict would look like. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=154.82s)]
*  Imagine what the region and the world would look like. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=156.3s)]
*  Now Israel's already done a lot of covert things over the years to push them back. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=158.66s)]
*  Assassinating scientists. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=163.5s)]
*  Hacking into their facilities, damaging their centrifuges. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=165.7s)]
*  They're going to need to do more of that because clearly this administration's not [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=169.34s)]
*  going to and hasn't deterred anything. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=172.38s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=174.74s)]
*  Pete, yesterday when I arrived early, I went out on the streets, talked to a lot of people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=175.74s)]
*  They already had tickets to the Patriot Awards. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=179.7s)]
*  There are people who have been saving their time and their money to be here tonight for [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  the big event. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=188.3s)]
*  That's a lot of weight on your shoulders. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=189.84s)]
*  It's a wonderful privilege. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you, Steve. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=193.82s)]
*  We met a wonderful group of ladies at dinner last night who drove from Maine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=195.98s)]
*  A mother and a daughter and a niece to see the show. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=200.34s)]
*  Lot of Minnesota, by the way. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=204.5s)]
*  A lot of them last night. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=205.5s)]
*  Outstanding. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=207.14s)]
*  So we got Maine, we got Minnesota, we got all over the place. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=208.14s)]
*  And it is a celebration of America. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=210.26s)]
*  I tell you, the producers, the crew, everything that goes. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=212.66s)]
*  This is a world class award show. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=216.17999999999998s)]
*  We've got about a hundred of them. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=218.14s)]
*  They're right down there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=219.42s)]
*  Give it up for Pete. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=220.66s)]
*  What's up, guys? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=221.66s)]
*  You ready? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=222.66s)]
*  We'll see you. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=223.66s)]
*  I mean, the best of America. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=225.34s)]
*  And I've got the whole show in my hands right here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=227.5s)]
*  Can you give me an idea of what's going to be on the show? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=230.02s)]
*  I don't see any Kill Me, but maybe we'll get there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=231.78s)]
*  Just keep checking. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=234.62s)]
*  No, we've got an MVP award. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=235.62s)]
*  Most Valuable Patriot, the Back the Blue, the Salute to Service. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  You're going to see a young Patriot award, a young kid, put in his country first, and [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=240.57999999999998s)]
*  then all the way to a World War II vet. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=245.42s)]
*  And then there's a local angle here, too, guys, which is the award you're giving out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  It is. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=250.42s)]
*  The last award of the night. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=251.42s)]
*  The last award is going to rock this place. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=252.42s)]
*  It's going to be great. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=254.46s)]
*  We're the last to go to bed and the first to wake up. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=255.46s)]
*  That was on purpose. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=257.26s)]
*  We don't mind. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=258.26s)]
*  We want to stay for the whole thing. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=259.26s)]
*  What do you love most about it? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=262.18s)]
*  The ability to shine the spotlight on people who never saw it, who are the backbone of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=263.86s)]
*  our republic. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=270.02s)]
*  If we're going to keep it, it's going to be on the shoulders of these people and the audience [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=271.12s)]
*  that comes to celebrate them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=275.78s)]
*  They're all Patriots. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=277.66s)]
*  They're all Patriots. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=278.66s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=279.66s)]
*  This is for our kids and grandkids. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=280.66s)]
*  If we're going to keep this country, it's going to be by celebrating those. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=282.14s)]
*  At the old Grand Opry house. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=284.7s)]
*  That's so sweet. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvAIf4pMV0E&t=285.7s)]
