# Karine Jean-Pierre holds White House briefing | 12/5/22
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 05, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o)
*  Thank you everyone. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=150.0s)]
*  Apologies for being late. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=151.74s)]
*  I had a, my meeting with the president of the Oval went long, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=153.44s)]
*  so I apologize. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=157.14s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=159.54s)]
*  Yeah, I have, I was just about to say, just give me a second, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=162.04s)]
*  Darlene. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=165.14s)]
*  I have a super, super short thing at the top and then we [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=166.14s)]
*  can get straight to questions. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=168.74s)]
*  So today marks the first day of National Flu Vaccine Week. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=170.74s)]
*  As flu and COVID-19 continue increasing in circulation, we [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=174.04s)]
*  are going to be making sure that we have flu-safe and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=177.48s)]
*  effective vaccines that are our best way to stay protected this [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=180.48s)]
*  winter. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=183.48s)]
*  The simple message from our health and medical expert is [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=184.48s)]
*  this, to be protected this winter, get your flu and COVID [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=187.48s)]
*  shots. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=190.48s)]
*  Today, Dr. Walensky held a briefing with the American [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=191.48s)]
*  Medical Association to kick off a week where she and doctors [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=194.48s)]
*  across the country will be blitzing the airwaves about the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=199.07999999999998s)]
*  importance of getting your COVID and flu shots. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=202.94s)]
*  And with that, Darlene, go for it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=206.17999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=208.94s)]
*  Can you give us a rundown on what is being done at the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=209.94s)]
*  federal level to speed up the restoration of electrical power [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  to the folks in North Carolina? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=215.94s)]
*  So, as you know, the White House is monitoring, has been [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  monitoring the situation and is in contact with local [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=221.07999999999998s)]
*  officials. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=223.79999999999998s)]
*  Local law enforcement is receiving federal support on [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=224.83999999999997s)]
*  the investigation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=228.27999999999997s)]
*  We will continue to let that investigation play out. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=229.27999999999997s)]
*  President Biden has made, as you all know, critical [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=233.58s)]
*  infrastructure secure and resilient to all hazards, both [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=236.28s)]
*  natural and manmade, a priority since the first day of his [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=239.72000000000003s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=243.24s)]
*  While we still have a long way to go through initiatives like [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=244.24s)]
*  the bipartisan infrastructure bill and also the Inflation [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=247.08s)]
*  Reduction Act, the Biden-Harris administration is already [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=251.54000000000002s)]
*  following through on its promise to deliver those results to [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=254.78s)]
*  protect against the limit and the limit of the impacts of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=259.82s)]
*  incidents like this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=263.28s)]
*  We've closely worked with private sector to strengthen [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=264.73999999999995s)]
*  resilience against the full spectrum of potential threats, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=268.02s)]
*  including through utilizing new technologies and improving how [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=271.28s)]
*  government communicates and shares threat information with [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=275.78s)]
*  the private sector, which owns the majority of our nation's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=278.97999999999996s)]
*  critical infrastructure. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=282.17999999999995s)]
*  Department of Energy, Department of Justice, including the FBI, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=283.28s)]
*  will be your best place to get more specific information. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  But again, we're going to let the investigation play out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=291.68s)]
*  But on the issue of restoring power, authorities there are [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=295.88s)]
*  saying it could be until Thursday before power is [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=298.72s)]
*  restored. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=301.28000000000003s)]
*  Understood. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=302.28000000000003s)]
*  We have been in touch with local officials and we are going to [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  provide any assistance needed to help them on the ground. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=308.04s)]
*  Thanks, Irene. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=314.74s)]
*  On Friday, you said there were no plans of going to Congress for [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  any legislative changes to the IRA for France and Europe. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=319.24s)]
*  Over the weekend, there were some French officials who said [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=323.64s)]
*  that one way of making tweaks that President Biden proposed to [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  the IRA was through executive orders. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=330.74s)]
*  And we're wondering if the administration has already [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=333.7s)]
*  started working on, you know, certain EOs or if you're planning [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=335.8s)]
*  to work on them going forward. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=339.68s)]
*  Can you offer any specifics? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  So there's two things. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=342.88s)]
*  The first thing is the President was clear that there are ways [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=344.64s)]
*  that we can address Europe's concerns, right? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=347.74s)]
*  The concerns that they actually have. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  This is a matter we are working through a substantive consultation [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=351.98s)]
*  with our European counterparts. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=356.0s)]
*  We don't want to get ahead of that process, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=359.38s)]
*  but we're going to have those conversations and find ways to, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=361.24s)]
*  again, address their concerns. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=365.54s)]
*  I was speaking to specifically like glitches that might be that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=366.94s)]
*  we have talked that we have heard about in particular in this [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=371.34000000000003s)]
*  particular piece of this law now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=374.3s)]
*  And so what I was saying, no, there are no, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=377.16s)]
*  we don't have plans to go back to Congress on that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=380.04s)]
*  But when it comes to their concerns, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=384.36s)]
*  of course we're going to have conversations with [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=386.84s)]
*  our European allies. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=388.6s)]
*  And specifically on that, I mean, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=390.1s)]
*  the administration did say during the French President's [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=391.4s)]
*  visit that, you know, that it had worked on overcoming French [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=394.1s)]
*  objections to whatever it is that they were talking about [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=397.54s)]
*  with respect to the IRA. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=400.9s)]
*  But the administration has, of course, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=403.4s)]
*  not released any specifics on that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=405.34s)]
*  And I know you're talking about, you know, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=407.28s)]
*  having future conversations with them, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=408.78s)]
*  but could you talk about the work that has gone in so far? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=410.67999999999995s)]
*  So, not going to get into specifics again. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=414.34s)]
*  We want to have this conversation. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=416.78s)]
*  There's a process that's happening. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=418.17999999999995s)]
*  Don't want to get ahead of that. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=419.53999999999996s)]
*  But I also just want to say, and you've heard us say this many [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=420.97999999999996s)]
*  times, you know, the Inflation Reduction Act was a historic [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=423.73999999999995s)]
*  piece of legislation. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=426.58s)]
*  It's going to help Americans, millions of Americans across the [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=428.08s)]
*  country as we talk about lowering costs, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=431.03999999999996s)]
*  as we talk about really attacking the number one [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=433.78s)]
*  priority when you think about the economy for the President, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=436.88s)]
*  which is lowering costs on health care, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=439.28s)]
*  lowering costs on energy, doing that historic investment on [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=441.11999999999995s)]
*  fighting climate change. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=446.02s)]
*  So this is something that the President is very proud of, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=447.32s)]
*  and it's going to really, truly change lives. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=450.41999999999996s)]
*  When it comes to the concerns of our European partners and [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=453.44s)]
*  allies, certainly we're going to do our best to have those [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=457.47999999999996s)]
*  conversations, but I'm just not going to get ahead of the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=460.71999999999997s)]
*  process that's currently happening. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=463.42s)]
*  The first one on the oil price gap. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=464.68s)]
*  Obviously, Russia has said that they're not going to abide by [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=468.98s)]
*  it, even if that means cutting production. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=471.88s)]
*  Ukraine is saying $60 is way too much. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=474.28000000000003s)]
*  Russian oil plants are selling in Asian markets at $79 a [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=477.06s)]
*  barrel, which is like $20 higher per barrel, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=480.16s)]
*  and which kind of shows that there is willingness to buy oil [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=484.18s)]
*  from Russia at that price. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=487.46000000000004s)]
*  I mean, given all the work that is going in, [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=488.96000000000004s)]
*  how confident are you that this is going to actually have any [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=491.68s)]
*  impact at all on Moscow and President Putin's? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=495.04s)]
*  So a couple of things. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=498.32s)]
*  You just asked me a couple of questions all at once, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=499.32s)]
*  or made a couple of statements all at once. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=501.52s)]
*  So when it comes to Russia's response, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=503.14s)]
*  look, we're not surprised by that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=506.12s)]
*  We're not surprised by what their reaction has been and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=507.42s)]
*  what they're saying. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=512.14s)]
*  Look, the goal of the price cap has always been to ensure that [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=513.14s)]
*  discounted Russian oil continues to flow onto global markets. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=516.72s)]
*  And even as we limit the energy revenue that Russia is using to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=520.58s)]
*  fund its illegal war in Ukraine, and so we believe that the cap [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=525.0200000000001s)]
*  at this level maintains clear incentives for Russia to [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=532.22s)]
*  continue exporting. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=535.24s)]
*  Not doing so would have serious repercussions for Russia. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=536.74s)]
*  And so that's how we see this process moving forward. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=539.94s)]
*  I know that you were mentioning why $30 and not $60, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=542.82s)]
*  and I know that there's been some comments out there. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=546.5400000000001s)]
*  And so, look, the price will lock in a discount on Russian oil, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=549.84s)]
*  especially in light of the $100 per barrel they earned just a few [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=554.08s)]
*  months ago, and it can be adjusted over time to prevent [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=558.34s)]
*  Russia from further profiting from its war. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=561.7800000000001s)]
*  And so we believe this is an unprecedented action that we're [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=564.74s)]
*  seeing right now, and it demonstrates the unity that [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=570.5400000000001s)]
*  United States and our allies and partners have. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=574.14s)]
*  And I think this is, we think this is an important step forward. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=576.44s)]
*  The Press. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=580.38s)]
*  In your meeting with the President, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=580.84s)]
*  did he indicate that he made any headway to his lunch with [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=581.74s)]
*  Senators Leahy and Shelby about reaching agreement on the [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=583.84s)]
*  top line for the omnibus? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=586.38s)]
*  Secretary Sebelius. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=588.1800000000001s)]
*  So don't have any readout for you on the President's lunch, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=589.1800000000001s)]
*  as you just mentioned. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=595.0400000000001s)]
*  Just first, for folks who may not be aware, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=596.24s)]
*  the President had lunch today with Senators Leahy and Shelby [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=599.08s)]
*  of the Senate Appropriations Committee to toast their long [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=603.1800000000001s)]
*  careers, but also to your point, Phil, to discuss the funding bill. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=607.14s)]
*  Look, the President believes that Congress needs to and has [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=611.08s)]
*  to reach a deal, a bipartisan deal. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=617.04s)]
*  This is something that they were able to do just last year around [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=618.74s)]
*  this time in a bipartisan way. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=622.14s)]
*  He believes that they should be able to do this again. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=623.84s)]
*  This should not be about partisanship. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=626.34s)]
*  We are talking about critical funding. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=628.6800000000001s)]
*  When you think about public education, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=631.58s)]
*  when you think about our national security, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=634.08s)]
*  when you think about, you know, about health, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=636.22s)]
*  these are important things that are critical to the [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=639.2800000000001s)]
*  American people. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=642.38s)]
*  So he believes that we should, the Congress should move forward [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=643.38s)]
*  in getting this done. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=647.12s)]
*  But more broadly speaking, and I said this last week, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=648.7800000000001s)]
*  when it comes to our efforts and the funding and how we're [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=652.2800000000001s)]
*  moving forward, we believe that process is in good hands with [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=656.62s)]
*  our OMB Director, Shalonda Young. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=659.82s)]
*  She knows how to get this done. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=662.36s)]
*  She knows how to get a bipartisan deal, get that done. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=664.46s)]
*  And also, you know, we have our Office of Ledge Affairs who is [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=668.9200000000001s)]
*  working on this as well. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=673.22s)]
*  They have been, we've had, you know, [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=674.9200000000001s)]
*  multiple conversations with a member of Congress, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=676.7600000000001s)]
*  and we're continuing to make calls, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=679.36s)]
*  we continue to do briefings. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=681.12s)]
*  But again, this is something that the President believes needs [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=682.96s)]
*  to get done. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=685.36s)]
*  It was done last year in a bipartisan way. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=686.36s)]
*  We should be able to do that this year. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=687.9200000000001s)]
*  The Press. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=689.76s)]
*  First, a follow-up on that. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=690.76s)]
*  Is the President, has he shown any openness to the idea of [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=691.76s)]
*  dropping a parity between defense spending and non-defense [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=693.76s)]
*  domestic spending, which is currently the Republican [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=696.46s)]
*  proposal? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=698.32s)]
*  So, look, I'll say this. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=699.32s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to get ahead of any discussions that [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=701.46s)]
*  are currently happening right now. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=704.96s)]
*  And so I know the Congress is moving forward, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=707.2s)]
*  having those discussions. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=709.9200000000001s)]
*  I'm certainly not going to be negotiating from here, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=710.9200000000001s)]
*  from the podium. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=713.72s)]
*  Thanks, Karina. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=714.72s)]
*  Two topics, if I can. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=715.72s)]
*  The Supreme Court heard arguments today about a graphic [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=717.5s)]
*  designer who objected to designing websites for gay [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=719.7s)]
*  couples. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=722.34s)]
*  The justices seem to be sympathetic toward her in today's [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=723.34s)]
*  on the court today. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=727.9000000000001s)]
*  We've heard the White House talk about the potential ripple [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=731.36s)]
*  effects after the Dobs ruling. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=733.5400000000001s)]
*  Do you have a comment on this specific case and any concerns [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=736.2s)]
*  from the administration about the potential wider implications [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=740.24s)]
*  of this particular case? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=743.3000000000001s)]
*  So I want to be very careful here, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=744.6s)]
*  I don't want to weigh in or prejudge the Supreme Court's [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=746.16s)]
*  outcome. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=749.6999999999999s)]
*  You know, that's something I'm going to do here at the podium. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=750.6999999999999s)]
*  But to your point, more broadly speaking, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=752.6999999999999s)]
*  and we have talked about this, we recognize the right to free [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=754.6999999999999s)]
*  speech and we support ensuring that no one is discriminated [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=758.56s)]
*  against or refuse services because of who they love and who [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=762.3s)]
*  they are. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=765.64s)]
*  And so, as you know, we've been very clear about that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=766.64s)]
*  The administration believes that every person, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=768.8399999999999s)]
*  no matter their sex, race, religion, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=770.76s)]
*  or who they love should have the equal access to society, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=774.04s)]
*  including access to products and services on the same terms [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=777.94s)]
*  as other members of public. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=781.34s)]
*  Look, the Department of Justice said in its brief that for [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=783.88s)]
*  decades, non-discrimination public accommodations laws [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=787.8s)]
*  have coexisted with the First Amendment. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=791.54s)]
*  Courts have recognized that we can require businesses open to [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=794.74s)]
*  public to service people regardless of their backgrounds. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=800.2s)]
*  Even when that means businesses must incidentally engage in [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=802.98s)]
*  speech which they are, which they disagree upon. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=808.26s)]
*  So this is no reason to upend this balance right now. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=811.32s)]
*  As the Department of Justice just laid out, [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=814.28s)]
*  as I just laid out what they're, what they said in their brief. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=817.58s)]
*  But again, I don't want to weigh in. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=820.88s)]
*  I don't want to get ahead of what the Supreme Court's [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=822.48s)]
*  decision will be on this. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=826.38s)]
*  And on the year end wish list and to-do list, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=827.62s)]
*  is there a push right now by the White House to renew the [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=831.38s)]
*  expanded child tax credit? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=833.88s)]
*  I don't have anything new to share on that particular piece [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=835.78s)]
*  of legislation or piece of a plan that's incredibly important [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=840.92s)]
*  to the President, as you know, he included in the American [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=846.56s)]
*  Rescue Plan. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=848.66s)]
*  And it was able to cut child poverty in a historic way. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=849.72s)]
*  So again, important issue for this President. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=854.86s)]
*  I don't have anything to share further on that particular plan [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=857.86s)]
*  moving forward. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=864.2600000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=865.2600000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Corrine. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=866.2600000000001s)]
*  I wonder if you could give more detail about the Wednesday [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=867.2600000000001s)]
*  event, about the rise of anti-Semitism that's hosted by [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=869.86s)]
*  the second gentleman. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=874.2600000000001s)]
*  The second gentleman. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=875.2600000000001s)]
*  Are you going to call him the first gentleman? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=876.2600000000001s)]
*  Slipped up. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=878.46s)]
*  How long has it been in the works and what do you hope, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=879.46s)]
*  Mr. What does the White House hope Mr. Imhoff adds to the debate? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=883.36s)]
*  So a couple of things just to give you some insight of what's [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=886.5s)]
*  going to be happening with that with the roundtable talks, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=888.96s)]
*  the anti-Semitism roundtable talks that the second [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=891.76s)]
*  gentleman will be hosting. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=893.9000000000001s)]
*  So first and foremost, President Biden has consistently [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=896.9200000000001s)]
*  spoken out. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=899.9200000000001s)]
*  I just want to make sure that's clear against anti-Semitism, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=900.9200000000001s)]
*  its rhetoric, its hate and all of the vile language that we [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=905.4200000000001s)]
*  have been hearing, which is incredibly dangerous this past [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=908.72s)]
*  couple of weeks. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=911.8000000000001s)]
*  And so we're going to continue condemning anti-Semitism and [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=912.9000000000001s)]
*  hate wherever it exists. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=916.9399999999999s)]
*  It does not have, it should not have a place in our society. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=918.54s)]
*  And so you'll continue to hear that. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=922.0s)]
*  The president says silence is complicit, complicity. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=924.16s)]
*  And so, you know, that is something that we will make [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=927.34s)]
*  sure that we continue to condemn. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=930.04s)]
*  Now, as it relates to Wednesday, the second gentleman, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=931.64s)]
*  Douglas Imhoff, will convene a roundtable with Jewish leaders [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=934.16s)]
*  from across the country. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=937.4s)]
*  The roundtable will include leaders of Jewish organizations [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=939.0s)]
*  fighting anti-Semitism that represents the wide range of [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=941.96s)]
*  Jewish community from students to seniors and including [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=945.44s)]
*  reform, conservative and orthodox denominations. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=948.6800000000001s)]
*  And the second gentleman will be joined by Ambassador Susan [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=951.98s)]
*  Rice, White House domestic policy advisor, Ambassador [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=955.0s)]
*  Deborah Lipstead, special envoy to monitor and combat [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=958.5s)]
*  anti-Semitism, and Keisha Lance Bottoms, senior advisor to the [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=962.6400000000001s)]
*  president for public engagement. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=965.94s)]
*  He felt it was important to host the roundtable given the rise, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=967.74s)]
*  as I just was mentioning, of anti-Semitism that we have seen [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=971.58s)]
*  over the past several months, even longer. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=975.1s)]
*  This is something the second gentleman takes very personally. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=978.16s)]
*  He is the first Jewish person in this role, the first Jewish [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=982.0400000000001s)]
*  individual married to a president or a vice president. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=985.4s)]
*  He has said himself that he is in pain and that this is [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=989.5400000000001s)]
*  something we cannot normalize. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=993.34s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons, as I just laid out, that he [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=995.3000000000001s)]
*  wanted to do this personally. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=998.6s)]
*  The Press. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1000.3000000000001s)]
*  Just a follow-up. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1001.1s)]
*  Is it something that he asked for or something that the [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1001.74s)]
*  President directed him to do? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1004.0s)]
*  Ambassador Rice. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1006.06s)]
*  Well, I just laid out the President has been very clear [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1006.56s)]
*  on condemning anti-Semitism, the hate that we have been seeing, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1009.26s)]
*  racism, the increase of hatred that we've been seeing just the [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1012.86s)]
*  past several months. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1017.06s)]
*  So this is something that his administration more broadly is [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1018.76s)]
*  going to continue to do when we talk about condemning that type [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1021.86s)]
*  of speech. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1025.14s)]
*  But look, I just laid out this is something when it comes to [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1025.64s)]
*  this roundtable that the second gentleman is holding, it's [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1028.9s)]
*  something that is very personal to him. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1030.94s)]
*  And important for him that he believed that he needed to do. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1033.8000000000002s)]
*  And clearly, it's part of our administration's response. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1037.2800000000002s)]
*  And certainly, we welcome it. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1042.1000000000001s)]
*  The Press. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1045.18s)]
*  To follow up a little bit on that, the week ahead after [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1045.7800000000002s)]
*  Wednesday there were no public events for the President, is [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1048.8400000000001s)]
*  that so he can take a more hands-on approach to the [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1051.44s)]
*  spending deal if necessary? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1053.98s)]
*  And can we expect him to drop by that anti-Semitism [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1055.74s)]
*  roundtable on Wednesday? [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1058.74s)]
*  Ambassador Rice. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1059.7s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1059.98s)]
*  I don't have anything to preview at this time on if he will be [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1060.44s)]
*  able to stop by. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1064.3200000000002s)]
*  Clearly, we're always working through the President's [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1065.94s)]
*  schedule, as you know. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1067.94s)]
*  But just to lay out the President's engagement on the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1069.24s)]
*  as we're discussing the government funding bill, look, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1073.0400000000002s)]
*  as you know, he had the big four here last week in leadership [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1077.5200000000002s)]
*  to talk about. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1081.0800000000002s)]
*  They talked about this. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1081.8200000000002s)]
*  You saw it in the readout. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1082.7800000000002s)]
*  He met with President Leahy and President, pardon me, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1084.5400000000002s)]
*  Senator Leahy and Shelby to have the discussion about the [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1089.18s)]
*  omnibus bill. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1092.52s)]
*  And so the President is going to continue to have those [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1093.82s)]
*  conversations. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1096.02s)]
*  He's going to continue to be involved. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1096.78s)]
*  I don't have anything to preview at this time on what [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1098.48s)]
*  the rest of his schedule is going to look like for the week. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1101.82s)]
*  And as it pertains to Wednesday also, could we expect remarks [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1103.6200000000001s)]
*  from him, regardless of what happens in Georgia on Wednesday? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1106.52s)]
*  And then, lastly, the President, he didn't end up going to [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1110.22s)]
*  Georgia during the campaign to campaign for Raphael Warnock. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1112.98s)]
*  He hasn't been during the runoff election. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1116.98s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1119.14s)]
*  So look, I need to be careful. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1120.14s)]
*  The Hatch Act, this is an ongoing, as you know, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1122.74s)]
*  election with this particular what we're seeing the runoff [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1127.74s)]
*  in Georgia. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1130.28s)]
*  So I want to be really careful here. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1131.78s)]
*  But I have said many times before at this podium that the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1132.98s)]
*  President will do anything that that he can do for Senator [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1135.78s)]
*  Warnock to be helpful to him. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1139.74s)]
*  As you all seen on the President's schedule recently, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1141.14s)]
*  he's done a high volume of fundraising, attended several [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1143.84s)]
*  political events, including phone banks and unions and much [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1147.9399999999998s)]
*  and with unions and much more. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1150.6s)]
*  Look, the way that we see this, if you think about the midterms [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1153.4399999999998s)]
*  that just occurred, the President played a big role here. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1156.8s)]
*  He set the narrative on how Democrats were going to move [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1159.8s)]
*  forward in the midterms, how they were going to talk about [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1164.0s)]
*  the successes that they had, how they were going to talk about [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1167.74s)]
*  what was important to American families. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1171.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1173.86s)]
*  They made that contrast with Republican electives, Republican [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1174.86s)]
*  officials who were talking about getting rid of Social Security [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1177.76s)]
*  and putting that on the chopping block, putting Medicare on the [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1181.36s)]
*  chopping block. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1183.6999999999998s)]
*  He talked about the freedoms of the American people wanted as [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1185.06s)]
*  it relates to Roe v. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1189.3s)]
*  Wade and how we saw the Supreme Court get rid of Roe. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1190.6999999999998s)]
*  And we talked about that and how Republicans wanted to put a [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1194.9599999999998s)]
*  national ban. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1198.76s)]
*  They were pushing for a national ban and it didn't matter which [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1200.26s)]
*  states, if you're a red or blue state. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1203.16s)]
*  And this is the thing that the President talked about and [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1205.0s)]
*  others followed. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1207.6000000000001s)]
*  So the President played a big role in setting that narrative, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1209.0s)]
*  setting that contrast. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1212.56s)]
*  And let's not forget the successes that we have seen, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1214.16s)]
*  his economic policy successes as we talk about the bipartisan [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1216.8s)]
*  infrastructure legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1219.96s)]
*  Those are the things that the President was able to get done. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1224.7s)]
*  And Democrats were able to run on it. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1229.36s)]
*  This has of course been a harsh season for respiratory illnesses [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1234.26s)]
*  in children and there continue to be anecdotal reports that [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1237.54s)]
*  some drugs are in short supply in certain places like children's [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1240.74s)]
*  Tylenol, Ibuprofen, Amoxicillin. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1244.24s)]
*  The supply chain is clearly under duress and some Americans [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1247.24s)]
*  are struggling to find the drugs they need. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1249.84s)]
*  What's the administration doing about it and how big of an issue [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1252.0s)]
*  do you believe it is? [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1254.56s)]
*  So first I would refer you to the FDA who was keeping a [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1255.5s)]
*  close eye on this and they will share more on any details about [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1259.26s)]
*  supplies as it relates to concerns on drugs, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1263.86s)]
*  which you're laying out to me, Ben. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1267.26s)]
*  But what I'll say more broadly on this is for context, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1269.06s)]
*  is that drug shortages are not uncommon and is something the [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1272.76s)]
*  administration is regularly monitoring. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1276.12s)]
*  The FDA is always tracking shortages at the national level [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1278.66s)]
*  and works closely with manufacturers to understand [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1282.26s)]
*  their production and supply. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1285.2s)]
*  And while FDA does not manufacture drugs and cannot [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1287.06s)]
*  require a pharmaceutical company to make a drug, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1290.94s)]
*  make more of a drug or change the distribution of a drug, [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1295.04s)]
*  FDA is in touch with the various manufacturers and stand ready to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1299.16s)]
*  provide support where possible. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1303.06s)]
*  Again, this is something that we are monitoring. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1305.44s)]
*  I would refer you to the FDA on any specifics. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1308.0s)]
*  Are you considering stepping in and working with companies in [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1310.46s)]
*  any way similar to how you all did with the baby formula shortage? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1312.76s)]
*  I don't have anything more to share on any type of outreach, [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1316.1599999999999s)]
*  but again, FDA would be the best place for you to get more [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1319.6599999999999s)]
*  details on how they're moving forward with this. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1322.76s)]
*  Go ahead, Wiche. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1325.06s)]
*  The administration decided whether to appeal the court [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1325.9399999999998s)]
*  ruling that ends Title 42 because the deadline is this week. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1329.8999999999999s)]
*  So I've been asked this question a couple times in the briefing [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1333.9599999999998s)]
*  room. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1336.8s)]
*  This is something that because it's a legal matter, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1337.8s)]
*  it's something that the Department of Justice will [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1339.9399999999998s)]
*  decide on and I would leave it to them. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1342.1599999999999s)]
*  I understand that the administration is considering a [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1344.32s)]
*  proposal that would bar certain migrants from receiving asylum [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1347.02s)]
*  here in the U.S. if they don't seek asylum in other countries [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1352.12s)]
*  first. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1355.86s)]
*  Is that a proposal that you're moving forward with or are there [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1356.86s)]
*  any other alternative measures to Title 42 on the table? [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1361.02s)]
*  So, look, we are committed to continuing to secure our borders [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1365.52s)]
*  while maintaining safe, orderly, and humane processing of [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1369.62s)]
*  migrants. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1373.92s)]
*  That is something that we are committed to under this [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1374.92s)]
*  administration. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1377.0800000000002s)]
*  This will remain the case with Title 42 when Title 42 is lifted. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1378.38s)]
*  Any suggestions that we might be changing a policy or looking at [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1383.88s)]
*  a different policy is inaccurate at this time. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1387.48s)]
*  I know there's been conversations about that. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1390.48s)]
*  We haven't made any, no such decisions have been made yet. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1393.38s)]
*  But again, we are committed to securing our border. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1396.5800000000002s)]
*  I have a couple of questions on this Chinese hack by the group [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1399.18s)]
*  APT 41. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1403.34s)]
*  The Secret Service says that this state-sponsored group of [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1404.6399999999999s)]
*  cyber criminals stole at least $20 million in COVID relief, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1410.44s)]
*  including small business administration loans, unemployment, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1416.08s)]
*  insurance funds. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1420.84s)]
*  What safeguards are in place to prevent this sort of fraud and [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1422.94s)]
*  why did they fail is my first question. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  So, look, we don't comment on specific law enforcement cases. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1429.6399999999999s)]
*  So, clearly not going to do that from the podium. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1434.44s)]
*  But the President has continually embraced and called for strong [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1437.3799999999999s)]
*  oversight and enforcement against potential fraud. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1441.28s)]
*  The President made clear that in the state of the union, in his state of the [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1445.58s)]
*  union just earlier this year, and when he announced the Justice Department's [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1449.28s)]
*  appointment of a chief prosecutor for pandemic fraud as part of the interagency [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1453.84s)]
*  COVID-19 fraud enforcement task force. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1458.74s)]
*  So for more on any specifics on this or any more details, like again, [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1461.84s)]
*  this is a legal enforcement matter. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1466.24s)]
*  This is something that the Department of Justice would be. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1468.3799999999999s)]
*  Will China produce any consequences? [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1470.4399999999998s)]
*  Again, this is something that the Department of Justice would be dealing [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1472.3799999999999s)]
*  with as it is an ongoing law enforcement matter. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1475.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1477.98s)]
*  Thanks, Karen. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1479.6999999999998s)]
*  On the trip tomorrow, President Biden has visited a lot of semiconductor plants. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1481.04s)]
*  What, can you just talk about what makes this one special? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1486.38s)]
*  Is it based on that it's run by Taiwan, Taiwan company? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1489.44s)]
*  Is it advanced chips? [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1494.64s)]
*  What's kind of differentiates this trip? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1495.84s)]
*  So it's a very good question. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1498.22s)]
*  We are going to be having a background call this evening at 630, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1499.84s)]
*  which is going to be led by Brian Deese. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1506.24s)]
*  And so I would encourage all of you to join that background call and [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1509.18s)]
*  you'll have more specifics. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1513.38s)]
*  I'm sorry, a backgrounder, backgrounder. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1515.48s)]
*  Yes, it's a backgrounder. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1517.6200000000001s)]
*  And as you know, it's usually lifted the next morning. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1519.02s)]
*  So yes, it is a background call with Brian Deese that will happen at 630. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1523.42s)]
*  So again, I'll encourage all of you to join. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1527.22s)]
*  But look, as you know, he's going to be going to Phoenix, Arizona to be discussing [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1530.0800000000002s)]
*  the American manufacturing. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1535.6200000000001s)]
*  Under this president, we have seen American manufacturing coming back to [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1537.32s)]
*  the US and a lot of that is because of the president's economic policies. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1542.96s)]
*  We've seen more than 700,000 manufacturing jobs created under this president. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1546.32s)]
*  And he is going to continue to talk about that, talk about the Chips and [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1551.32s)]
*  Science Act and that historic piece of legislation that was, as you all know, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1555.22s)]
*  bipartisan piece of legislation that is going to continue making sure that we [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1559.12s)]
*  have manufacturing jobs right here in the US. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1564.88s)]
*  So again, you'll get more details on that. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1568.1200000000001s)]
*  Don't want to get ahead of that conversation that will be had by Brian Deese at 730. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1570.7800000000002s)]
*  It's a background call. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1575.8200000000002s)]
*  I again, encourage all of you to join. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1576.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1578.48s)]
*  Two questions for you. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1579.68s)]
*  First on the North Carolina power outage. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1580.5200000000002s)]
*  The local authorities have said they believe it's an intentional attack. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1582.98s)]
*  Is the White House aware of any motive that might have been behind that? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1586.2800000000002s)]
*  Again, I'm just not going to get ahead of the process. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1589.92s)]
*  It is being looked at, investigated currently. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1592.96s)]
*  I'm going to let that investigation play out. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1596.28s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Energy, Department of Justice, FBI, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1599.0s)]
*  to get any more specific details on that. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1602.96s)]
*  And then Democratic leaders in the House are discussing attaching Senator [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1604.92s)]
*  Manchin's permitting bill to the annual defense policy bill, which is a must pass. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1609.16s)]
*  Is the White House urging that too? [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1614.88s)]
*  And if so, how are you doing that? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1616.88s)]
*  So yes, the President believes we should pass the defensive authorization bill, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1619.12s)]
*  and that the permitting bill should be included in that legislation. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1623.7199999999998s)]
*  So that is something that we support from here. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1627.1599999999999s)]
*  Good, Stephen. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1629.1999999999998s)]
*  Other things on the to-do list, the antitrust tech bill. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1630.4399999999998s)]
*  Does the President want to see action on that in the later time? [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1634.1599999999999s)]
*  I don't have anything more to say than what I shared last week. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1636.3999999999999s)]
*  I refer you back to, I was asked about this a couple times last week, so [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1640.0s)]
*  I refer you back to those comments. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1643.76s)]
*  Thanks, the Electoral Count Act reform, is that something that you're sure of? [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1645.04s)]
*  That is something that is indeed important to the President, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1647.3999999999999s)]
*  and he wants to see that move forward. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1650.12s)]
*  There was word today of an agreement in principle between Senators Tillis and [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1653.1599999999999s)]
*  Sinema on immigration reform, is that something? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1655.6799999999998s)]
*  So we haven't seen all of the kind of the language on that particular bill, so [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1658.0s)]
*  don't want to comment from here, don't want to get too far ahead. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1663.36s)]
*  I know there's a draft of proposal. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1667.08s)]
*  But look, the President has repeatedly called on Congress to permanently protect [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1669.76s)]
*  streamers, farm workers, essential workers, and others, and [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1674.48s)]
*  to provide them with the pathway to citizenship. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1678.0800000000002s)]
*  Remember, the first day of his administration, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1680.3600000000001s)]
*  he put forth a comprehensive immigration bill. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1683.24s)]
*  So we are committed to working with members of Congress from both parties on [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1686.52s)]
*  real solutions to modernize our outdated immigration system. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1690.8s)]
*  So that is certainly a priority for the President, but [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1695.1200000000001s)]
*  we haven't seen the detailed proposals, so I can't comment about that from here. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1697.6000000000001s)]
*  One last thing, Senator Shaheen has a statement. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1700.64s)]
*  She's apparently not coming to the ball tonight. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1703.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1705.12s)]
*  She's upset that the President endorsed a proposal to put South Carolina [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1706.52s)]
*  in New Hampshire, and she says that New Hampshire is now vulnerable for her party. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1710.88s)]
*  Does the President have a response to that? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1716.28s)]
*  So look, we honor the Hatch Act, as I mentioned many times before here, [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1718.52s)]
*  as we are talking about a potential election, a 2024 presidential election. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1724.36s)]
*  But looking backward, it is the ultimate irony that the 2020 election [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1730.0s)]
*  was proven by the Trump administration's homeland. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1736.24s)]
*  Sorry, I think I got ahead of myself there. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1740.44s)]
*  We take the law very seriously here, and so that's the number one thing. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1744.28s)]
*  And again, I wanna be very careful because of 2024. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1748.44s)]
*  And it places strict limits on what I can say because of the Hatch Act about [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1752.04s)]
*  future elections and of course political party processes. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1756.16s)]
*  I know I was asked this question many times before about the DNC. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1758.92s)]
*  And so I've always referred folks to go to the DNC. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1763.2s)]
*  But again, as a candidate in 2020, and as we have heard the night of [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1766.04s)]
*  New Hampshire primary, Joe Biden was very clear that to him, [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1770.68s)]
*  respecting our diversity as a nation and breaking down barriers for [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1774.92s)]
*  our people is a fundamental principle. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1778.92s)]
*  And so he believes that what Democrats in office stand for, and [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1782.0800000000002s)]
*  he has upheld that principle as president. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1786.68s)]
*  And so again, you've seen him do that throughout his almost two years in [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1789.3600000000001s)]
*  administration, making sure that we see the diversity within his administration. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1793.64s)]
*  That is represented clearly across the country, and [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1798.44s)]
*  he wants to honor those values. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1801.68s)]
*  And so that's as far as I'm gonna get from here about the specific calendar. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1803.72s)]
*  Again, don't wanna get into politics as it relates to political parties. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1809.5200000000002s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1814.6s)]
*  Can you talk about with Congress considering repealing the COVID vaccine [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1815.36s)]
*  mandate for service members in the NDAA? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1819.8s)]
*  John Kirby spoke earlier about the president's position, [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1823.8s)]
*  Secretary Austin's position of wanting obviously to keep it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1826.48s)]
*  So what is the White House prepared to do for that aspect of it? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1829.44s)]
*  And is the president personally engaging with lawmakers on this? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1832.68s)]
*  So look, when the president met with the big four just last week, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1835.24s)]
*  as you all know, as you know, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1840.04s)]
*  Leader McCarthy raised eliminating the requirement that service members be [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1842.44s)]
*  vaccinated against COVID-19. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1846.4s)]
*  So clearly they had a conversation as you asked me about talking to members. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1848.76s)]
*  The president told him that he would consider it, but [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1852.92s)]
*  also made clear that he wanted to consult with the Pentagon. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1856.12s)]
*  And since then, as we've all heard, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1859.64s)]
*  the Secretary of Defense has recommended retaining the mandate. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1862.6s)]
*  That's because the COVID vaccination requirement was put in place to keep our [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1866.92s)]
*  service members safe and healthy and prepared for service. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1871.0400000000002s)]
*  And I would remind all of you that the Pentagon has a range of vaccines. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1874.92s)]
*  It has long required. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1880.96s)]
*  So this is nothing new. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1882.2800000000002s)]
*  Again, there's history here, there's precedent. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1884.3200000000002s)]
*  So with respect to NDAA, those discussions are ongoing. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1888.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't wanna get ahead of it. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1892.16s)]
*  But clearly, as I just mentioned, it was brought up in their conversation that he [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1893.8s)]
*  had with the big four just last week. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1897.8s)]
*  Has he had conversations about it since then? [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1899.92s)]
*  I don't have anything else to preview at this time for [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1901.8s)]
*  you on conversations specifically on the NDAA. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1904.12s)]
*  I can say that we're just not gonna get ahead of the process that's currently [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1907.72s)]
*  happening in Congress. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1911.84s)]
*  And you've said from the podium that the White House isn't gonna respond to every [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1913.12s)]
*  single thing that former President Trump says or does. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1915.96s)]
*  But the White House also did put out some statements over the weekend about his [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1918.36s)]
*  calls to essentially overturn the 2020 election and put aside the Constitution. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1922.28s)]
*  So I'm wondering if you can elaborate on that and [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1927.48s)]
*  share more about any response to his comments. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1929.8s)]
*  So look, and again, he is a declared candidate. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1932.08s)]
*  So I want to be very careful on how I respond to someone who has declared in 2024. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1940.1200000000001s)]
*  But this is what I was trying to say earlier, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1945.92s)]
*  as it relates to 2020 and election conspiracy. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1949.44s)]
*  Look, it's an irony, right, that 2020 election was, that he says this, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1955.3600000000001s)]
*  because ultimately it was proven by the Trump administration's [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1960.6000000000001s)]
*  homeland security officials to be the most secure of all time. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1966.4s)]
*  And not just the homeland security officials, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1970.3200000000002s)]
*  it was also upheld by Trump's administration's attorney general. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1972.56s)]
*  And by over 80 federal judges of whom were nominated by Donald Trump himself. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1976.56s)]
*  And so in 2022, the American people came together just past midterms and [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1983.0s)]
*  utterly rejected the dangerous conspiracy that we have been hearing, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1988.3999999999999s)]
*  the big lie that we have been hearing from the former president, but [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1991.8799999999999s)]
*  also many Republicans. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1995.72s)]
*  And so look, American people have been very clear. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  They oppose the way that Republicans have talked about this. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2002.52s)]
*  They oppose the violent rhetoric that extreme MAGA officials have engaged in. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2008.68s)]
*  And so we should listen to what the American people had to say just a couple [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2013.3600000000001s)]
*  of weeks ago. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2017.08s)]
*  Okay. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2018.88s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2019.38s)]
*  Yeah, and then I'll go back. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2019.88s)]
*  Okay, thanks. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2021.84s)]
*  Just on Arizona again, is there another side to this trip, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2023.04s)]
*  a political side and beyond the chips aspect? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2026.48s)]
*  Because he said a lot of similar speeches in future or current plants. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2030.48s)]
*  Probably to a lot of Americans, Arizona, politically speaking, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2036.24s)]
*  might sound like that place where they have a lot of election deniers. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2039.08s)]
*  So it's kind of a hot spot politics. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2042.24s)]
*  So I'm not gonna get ahead of the background call that's gonna happen at 630. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2045.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna let Brian Deese speak to why this trip is so important. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2049.2s)]
*  Why what TSMC's semiconductor material manufacturing facility is a big deal. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2054.28s)]
*  And so, again, don't wanna get ahead of it. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2062.6400000000003s)]
*  I will encourage you to join the call and [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2065.0s)]
*  you'll hear more about the president's trip tomorrow. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2067.88s)]
*  Okay, but I mean, I'm not talking on the chip side, right? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2070.36s)]
*  I know, you're asking me if there's- Is there a message politically? [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2072.6400000000003s)]
*  You're asking me, because it's in Arizona? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2075.6800000000003s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2078.2400000000002s)]
*  Why, because he's been to a bunch of places where roads are similar. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2079.1600000000003s)]
*  No, I hear your question, but the president's- [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2082.0s)]
*  It's a very different part of the country. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2083.0s)]
*  No, I hear your question, but the president has said this over and over again. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2084.8s)]
*  He's a president for everyone. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2087.2s)]
*  Whether you live in a red state, blue state, purple state, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2089.8s)]
*  this is about delivering for the American people. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2094.36s)]
*  This is about keeping his promises as he moves forward with his economic policies. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2097.4s)]
*  Look, the Chips and Science Act is a historic piece of legislation that is [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2103.08s)]
*  going to bring, and we're seeing this already, manufacturing back to the US. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2106.44s)]
*  And has created hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2111.72s)]
*  And so that's why this is an important move forward that we're seeing with [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2115.8799999999997s)]
*  this particular facility in Arizona, and he wants to highlight that. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2122.56s)]
*  He wants to lift that up. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2126.0s)]
*  And so I don't want to get ahead of what the announcements are going to be or [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2127.8799999999997s)]
*  what he's going to talk specifically about what we're going to see at [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2131.56s)]
*  this facility tomorrow. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2135.3999999999996s)]
*  But as you think about politics, as you're asking me this question, again, [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2137.2799999999997s)]
*  this is a president who has been very, very clear. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2140.92s)]
*  He's going to deliver for all Americans. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2143.44s)]
*  Very, very quick one about the medical. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2145.8s)]
*  I think you've said previously that part of the medical has been done already, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2147.88s)]
*  physical exam. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2150.92s)]
*  When will the rest of it be done, like very roughly? [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2152.6s)]
*  Is it by the end of the year? [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2154.6800000000003s)]
*  Don't have any specific dates to lay out or a timeline to lay out. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2156.16s)]
*  I can say, I think I've said this last week, it was going to be in the next few [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2160.48s)]
*  months, we will release the president's physical in the same fashion, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2163.6s)]
*  in the same transparent fashion as we did last year. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2168.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2173.64s)]
*  Thank you so much, Karine. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2174.16s)]
*  This morning, the National Security Advisor met with President-elect of [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2176.08s)]
*  Brazil Lula for about one hour and 30 minutes. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2180.08s)]
*  What would you highlight from the meeting? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2183.6s)]
*  And also Mr. Sullivan invited Lula to the White House before Lula's [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2185.3999999999996s)]
*  inauguration, January 1st. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2191.72s)]
*  Is that visit happening? [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2194.24s)]
*  And why is the White House extending this very, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2196.2799999999997s)]
*  not very common invitation to Lula even before he's the president? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2199.16s)]
*  So to your first question, the two of them had a ride, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2203.6s)]
*  ranging and productive conversation about how the United States and Brazil can [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2207.68s)]
*  continue to work together to address common challenges and [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2212.24s)]
*  deepen our strong bilateral relationship. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2215.56s)]
*  And we will have a fuller readout of the visit, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2218.7599999999998s)]
*  the Jake Sullivan's visit to Brazil later today. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2221.64s)]
*  And you'll have more details on that. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2225.72s)]
*  To your last question, look, we will have more to share on that soon as your [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2229.12s)]
*  question to a visit. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2233.2799999999997s)]
*  Look, this is really important to the president. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2234.7599999999998s)]
*  We have said before, we've been working with members of incoming Lula's [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2238.56s)]
*  administration for a face-to-face engagement. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2243.68s)]
*  That's nothing new. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2245.8399999999997s)]
*  We've talked about that. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2246.56s)]
*  And we're at high levels so that we can hit the ground running once President [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2247.96s)]
* -elect Lula becomes president in January. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2252.76s)]
*  So this is something that we have been very clear about, very transparent about. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2255.56s)]
*  Again, as I just stated, we want to hit the ground running with that relationship, [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2259.7200000000003s)]
*  that important bilateral relationship that we have with Brazil. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2263.16s)]
*  And did the White House decide who you guys are sending to the inauguration? [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2266.6s)]
*  It's going to be the vice president. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2271.92s)]
*  The delegation, the US delegation. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2273.2s)]
*  Who's going to be leading the delegation? [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2275.0s)]
*  We'll have more to share on what that's going to, what that makeup of the [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2277.64s)]
*  delegation might look like. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2280.8799999999997s)]
*  I don't have anything to share for you at this time. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2282.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2284.2799999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2285.2799999999997s)]
*  The administration said they're going to refill the strategic petroleum reserve [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2286.2s)]
*  under $70 a barrel. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2289.64s)]
*  The Russian price cap went into effect today, $60 a barrel. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2291.16s)]
*  Is the president considering putting Russian oil in the strategic petroleum [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2295.72s)]
*  reserve? [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2299.08s)]
*  No, because it's been banned. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2299.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay. What about in Arizona? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2301.3599999999997s)]
*  I just want to ask you, he's going to that chips factory. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2302.8399999999997s)]
*  Any plans in Arizona to go to the border and see for the situation for himself there? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2304.96s)]
*  So look, I want to be very clear here. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2309.6s)]
*  The president's trips tomorrow is about the American manufacturing boom. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2312.36s)]
*  We're seeing all across the country, thanks to, again, his economic policies. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2316.7200000000003s)]
*  Again, more than we have seen in his, you know, almost two year term. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2320.32s)]
*  More than 700,000 jobs, manufacturing jobs that have been created just here alone [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2326.32s)]
*  in the United States. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2332.36s)]
*  So he'll be visiting at TSMC, a company making a major investment to manufacturing [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2333.88s)]
*  cutting edge chips in Phoenix. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2339.08s)]
*  This investment will bring new jobs and economic opportunity to Arizona. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2341.12s)]
*  Very important to the people in Arizona. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2345.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's a large part thanks to the Chips and Science Act, the president signed it [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2347.48s)]
*  to law. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2351.32s)]
*  And historic, let's not forget, a bipartisan piece of legislation. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2352.1600000000003s)]
*  And look, we should be able to reach a bipartisan, you know, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2356.08s)]
*  bipartisan agreement on immigration, too. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2361.72s)]
*  And that's what we're calling for, right? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2363.9199999999996s)]
*  We're asking for Republican officials to come and work with us and let's have a [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2366.04s)]
*  bipartisan agreement on immigration instead of doing political stunts, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2371.3999999999996s)]
*  instead of doing what they're doing, going to the border, not actually coming up with [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2375.6s)]
*  any real ideas about that. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2380.56s)]
*  That's where I will leave it. [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2383.56s)]
*  That's what the president is doing tomorrow. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2384.72s)]
*  He's going to go to Arizona to talk about an important initiative that's going to [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2386.4399999999996s)]
*  change Americans lives, specifically in Arizona. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2391.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2394.64s)]
*  Let me create just a follow up on every question. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2395.64s)]
*  If the president is not going to make time to visit the border during his trip to [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2399.2s)]
*  tomorrow, during his trip tomorrow to a border state, will he do it in New Year? [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2402.56s)]
*  Look, I addressed this last week about the president visiting the border. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2409.4s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what I just laid out. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2412.44s)]
*  I think and we believe the question again, as I was just answering to your colleague [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2415.3599999999997s)]
*  in the back, is that what are congressional Republicans going to do to actually deal [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2420.64s)]
*  with this issue instead of doing political stunts, many of the political stunts that [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2426.92s)]
*  hurt families, that hurt kids, that hurt children, right? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2432.0s)]
*  That hurt people who are coming here to try to seek asylum, leaving a dictatorship. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2435.64s)]
*  Instead of going to the border and talking about things that not going to actually deliver [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2445.36s)]
*  and keep our border safe, why don't they work with us? [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2453.0s)]
*  Why don't they actually do something? [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2456.36s)]
*  Why don't they actually help the president get the funding that he requested, historic [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2457.96s)]
*  funding into the Department of Homeland Security? [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2464.52s)]
*  That's one way of doing that. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2469.32s)]
*  But again, they're playing political games and doing political stunts. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2470.72s)]
*  The reason I ask is just because the president had said previously that he hadn't had a lot [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2474.3199999999997s)]
*  of time to get to the border. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2478.04s)]
*  He's going to a border state tomorrow, so you think maybe there would be time there. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2479.04s)]
*  If there isn't tomorrow, can you say at this point that he's going to... [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2484.8399999999997s)]
*  What I'm saying is tomorrow he's going to actually focus on an issue, a bipartisan issue [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2489.04s)]
*  that was voted in Congress, the CHIPS and Science Act, something that is going to deliver [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2493.72s)]
*  people in Arizona, creating jobs and making people's lives better and making sure that [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2499.44s)]
*  we are bringing manufacturing back into the U.S. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2505.48s)]
*  That is critically important. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2509.6400000000003s)]
*  Now what I'm saying, the second part of that to your question, if Republicans officials [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2511.52s)]
*  truly, truly want to deal with immigration, they truly want to deal with the border, then [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2515.8s)]
*  they would stop doing political stunts and actually work with us on the plan that we [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2521.76s)]
*  have put forward, which they are not. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2526.0s)]
*  That's what we want to make very loud and clear. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2528.76s)]
*  There's ways to deal with this. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2531.0s)]
*  Again, they can come and actually do this in a bipartisan way, just like we did with [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2532.6800000000003s)]
*  the CHIPS and Science Act. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2537.2000000000003s)]
*  The trip is obviously to Phoenix, not to the border, not to Georgia, which is sort of a [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2538.2000000000003s)]
*  pressing issue for Democrats for the president. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2546.6000000000004s)]
*  Have Democrats determined that a visit to Georgia would not help Senator Warnock's reelection [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2549.1200000000003s)]
*  bid? [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2554.6000000000004s)]
*  The president actually, and I actually already answered this and I'll just repeat what I [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2555.92s)]
*  just said. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2559.2799999999997s)]
*  The president, and I want to be very careful about talking about an election that's happening [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2561.08s)]
*  tomorrow, because it's an ongoing election and I'm covered on the Hatch Act, so I'm not [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2565.52s)]
*  going to comment on that specifically. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2572.3199999999997s)]
*  But when we look back on the president's role during the midterm elections, he played a [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2573.92s)]
*  significant role for Democrats. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2579.08s)]
*  Again, I just answered this question, is because of the way he made the contrast with Republican [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2582.44s)]
*  officials, again, who talked about putting Social Security and Medicare on the chopping [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2587.2s)]
*  block because they were upset about the Inflation Reduction Act, which is a historic piece of [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2593.32s)]
*  legislation that's going to lower costs for American families. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2598.32s)]
*  That's what they were upset about because we were saying we wanted to make sure big [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2602.32s)]
*  corporations pay their fair share and not put it on the little guy. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2606.8799999999997s)]
*  And that's what they put forward. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2612.3599999999997s)]
*  And the American people spoke really loud and clear. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2614.16s)]
*  That's not what they want. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2618.12s)]
*  They want us to continue to fight for their freedoms. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2619.74s)]
*  They want us to continue to fight for democracy. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2622.3999999999996s)]
*  And that red wave never happened. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2626.2s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2628.6s)]
*  Just real quick on Twitter, because you guys said you're keeping a close eye on Elon Musk's [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2629.6s)]
*  ownership and it's the first time we've talked to you since he released the files a few days [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2633.44s)]
*  ago. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2638.36s)]
*  Is it the White House view that decisions at Twitter were made appropriately in terms [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2639.36s)]
*  of decisions to censor this reporting ahead of the election? [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2644.76s)]
*  You mischaracterize, actually, what I actually said and took it out of context when you asked [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2650.92s)]
*  her a question. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2655.68s)]
*  Look, when I answered the question, and I actually already addressed this, about how [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2657.3199999999997s)]
*  the White House and the administration is seeing what's happening on Twitter, we follow [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2663.4399999999996s)]
*  also what's going on just like you guys are reporting, just like you guys are seeing. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2670.08s)]
*  And what I was commenting to is like, yes, we're seeing what is happening, just like you [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2674.64s)]
*  all are seeing what's happening with Twitter. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2679.16s)]
*  So just want to clear that up because you definitely mischaracterized what I said or [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2681.3199999999997s)]
*  put it out of context. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2685.64s)]
*  And so can you ask your question again? [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2687.72s)]
*  Yes, my question was that you had said, I think, six or so days ago that the White House [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2689.48s)]
*  was watching closely the situation at Twitter after Elon Musk's ownership of it with respect [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2694.2799999999997s)]
*  to misinformation. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2700.72s)]
*  And because these files were released on the basis of hack materials clause at Twitter, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2703.0s)]
*  which decisions by whom? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2712.72s)]
*  By Twitter. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2724.48s)]
*  By Twitter on, okay. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2725.68s)]
*  So look, we see this as an interesting or a coincidence, if I may, that he would so [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2727.68s)]
*  haphazardly, Twitter would so haphazardly push this distraction. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2736.32s)]
*  That is full of old news, if you think about it. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2742.0s)]
*  And at the same time, Twitter is facing very real and very serious questions about the [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2746.16s)]
*  rising volume of anger, hate, and anti-Semitism on their platform and how they're letting [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2751.8399999999997s)]
*  it happen. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2757.8399999999997s)]
*  And the president said last week, more leaders need to speak out and reject this. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2759.6s)]
*  And it's very alarming and very dangerous. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2765.48s)]
*  But our focus right now is helping the American families. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2768.64s)]
*  I just talked about what the president is going to be doing in Arizona, talking about [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2771.08s)]
*  the Chips and Science Act, talking about how we're bringing manufacturing jobs back here [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2774.04s)]
*  to the U.S., talking about under this administration, more than 700,000 jobs have been created, [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2778.04s)]
*  in manufacturing jobs to be more specific. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2784.92s)]
*  Look, what is happening? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2787.0s)]
*  It's frankly, it's not healthy. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2788.88s)]
*  It won't do anything to help a single American improve their lives. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2790.7599999999998s)]
*  And so, look, we see this as an interesting coincidence, and it's a distraction. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2795.08s)]
*  Thanks, Kareem. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2804.6s)]
*  Kareem, just one more on the NDAA. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2806.04s)]
*  Some members of Congress are talking about providing security assistance to Taiwan in [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2808.76s)]
*  the range of about $10 billion over five years. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2814.04s)]
*  Does the White House have a position on that? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2817.32s)]
*  And is there any concern that providing additional security assistance to Taiwan might act as [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2818.92s)]
*  a heuridic relationship with China? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2824.44s)]
*  So, look, I'm not going to get ahead of the process as it relates to in Congress or the [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2826.36s)]
*  NDAA. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2832.28s)]
*  I'll say this more broadly. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2833.48s)]
*  We continue to work with Congress on ways we can reinforce deterrence across the Taiwan [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2834.6s)]
*  Strait and build Taiwan's resilience in meaningful ways, including the self-defense capabilities. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2839.96s)]
*  But again, I'm not going to get ahead of the process that we're currently seeing in Congress [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2845.8s)]
*  at this time. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2849.7200000000003s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2850.36s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2851.56s)]
*  Oh, what do I? [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2853.16s)]
*  What's going on? [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2854.44s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2855.08s)]
*  Arizona. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2855.72s)]
*  Oh, OK. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2856.7599999999998s)]
*  Are you going to take a question on US-Africa Summit? [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2858.3599999999997s)]
*  It's the biggest gathering of the year. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2861.64s)]
*  OK, I'll take that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2863.48s)]
*  Let me just do this, and I'll... [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2864.68s)]
*  OK, we have a guest. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2869.3999999999996s)]
*  I forgot. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2871.96s)]
*  OK, so we are pleased to have a local reporter from the Arizona Republic [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2877.7999999999997s)]
*  and Arizona Central join us in the briefing room today and ahead of the President's trip, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2883.0s)]
*  as we've been talking about Arizona and the Chips and Science Act. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2888.92s)]
*  His name is Ronald J. Henson. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2892.12s)]
*  He is the paper's national political reporter and has been a member of their team for about [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2894.52s)]
*  15 years. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2898.52s)]
*  And Ron, thank you for joining us. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2899.96s)]
*  Hello. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2901.96s)]
*  Yeah, hi. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2903.56s)]
*  Thanks, Corrine. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2904.2s)]
*  As you know, the TSMC plant was announced in 2020. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2905.72s)]
*  So I wanted to know a couple of things. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2909.56s)]
*  Number one, what should ordinary Americans expect that is attributable to the Chips Act? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2912.7599999999998s)]
*  How soon should they be seeing the effects of that in Arizona or elsewhere? [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2919.24s)]
*  And also, in the long run, should the government be playing any greater role in providing more [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2923.32s)]
*  water resources to a place like Arizona in light of this water-intensive industry? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2929.96s)]
*  So on your first question, Ronald, I would refer you to the Department of Commerce as [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2936.52s)]
*  timeline. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2943.24s)]
*  They're working on this, and they're playing point when it comes to the Chips and Science Act. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2944.28s)]
*  On your final question, it's important that these facilities are built sustainably [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2948.68s)]
*  and in a way that doesn't harm the environment of a region. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2954.12s)]
*  We know that these chip fabs can be water-intensive, but both TSMC and Intel have taken [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2958.36s)]
*  steps to reduce water usage at their facilities in Arizona. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2965.4s)]
*  In the case of TSMC, they have planned on a site, an industrial water reclamation plant that will [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2969.2400000000002s)]
*  significantly reduce liquid discharge within the Biden administration. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2978.28s)]
*  It is an issue. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2982.52s)]
*  We take this very seriously as evidenced by funding for Arizona drought resiliency resources, [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2983.56s)]
*  including included in the Inflation Reduction Act, as you know, Ronald. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2989.08s)]
*  As these projects continue, state officials, local officials will need to take this issue [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2993.72s)]
*  seriously as they work with chip makers and build in their region. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=2998.84s)]
*  There you go, Ronald. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=3005.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=3006.12s)]
*  I know there was a question on the summit. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=3009.0s)]
*  We will have more to share in the next couple of days. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=3014.44s)]
*  Yes, the U.S. summit is incredibly important. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=3017.2400000000002s)]
*  We have invited 49 African heads of state to Washington, D.C. for a three-day summit [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b9jhJ1I842o&t=3020.04s)]
