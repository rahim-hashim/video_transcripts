# Tyrants are ‘having a field day’ on Harris’ watch: Rep. Mike Waltz
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 23, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4)
*  Want to bring in Michael Walsh, Republican congressman of the Florida, member of several [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=0.0s)]
*  committees dealing with the National Security Council, former Greenbury colonel. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=2.84s)]
*  Sir, good to have you on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=5.76s)]
*  Are you buying what she was selling as you heard it last night? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=7.54s)]
*  You know, Bill, it would be—it would just be laughable if it weren't so serious. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=11.68s)]
*  This week is the three-year anniversary of the Abbey Gate bombing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=18.22s)]
*  Zero mention of Afghanistan, which she proudly took credit for in other interviews, patting [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=22.28s)]
*  herself on the back as being the last person in the room. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=29.419999999999998s)]
*  So she says that she's going to be tough on tyrants, but tyrants have been on the march. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=32.26s)]
*  They have been having a field day on her watch the last four years. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  The Taliban have taken over Afghanistan. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=43.22s)]
*  Putin has invaded Ukraine. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=45.54s)]
*  Hamas has invaded Israel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=47.379999999999995s)]
*  China is on the march. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=49.5s)]
*  Heck, just this week, Maduro stole yet another election. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=51.22s)]
*  So I mean, I guess she was saying this is going to be a continuation of the last four [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=55.58s)]
*  years of Biden in terms of her foreign policy, which is appeasement first. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=60.98s)]
*  Can we find yet another concession? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=66.66s)]
*  Weakness on the world stage, and we see the world on fire as a result of it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=69.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=73.98s)]
*  She mentioned that she had met with Putin, was it five days before the war started? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=74.98s)]
*  The transition for that was, hey, I got all the NATO allies together, but I think the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=82.78s)]
*  point is, well, stop the damn war. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=86.66s)]
*  Don't let it happen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=89.06s)]
*  That Ukraine war forced every government in the world to choose a side. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=91.5s)]
*  And we're still living with it today. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=97.94s)]
*  I want to transition to Gaza because apparently- Yeah, Afghanistan was the original sin though, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=100.25999999999999s)]
*  Bill. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=104.94s)]
*  It really was. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=105.94s)]
*  Yeah, I understand your point on that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=106.94s)]
*  We've talked about that in the past. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=107.94s)]
*  So Sinwar was promoted about a week ago and apparently, reportedly that he's saying, let [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=109.3s)]
*  me survive. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=115.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=116.58s)]
*  Now, you know what all the leaders of MAS have done. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=117.58s)]
*  They left Gaza. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=120.7s)]
*  They're living big lives in Qatar. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=121.7s)]
*  It's almost like, it was almost a tell as soon as you heard that a week ago, that he [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  was looking to get out of Gaza alive. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=130.3s)]
*  Is that how you saw it? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=132.4s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=134.22s)]
*  And that's because Haneeya is dead and that's because, who was the previous political leader [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=136.98s)]
*  in Qatar, that the Israelis took out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  So he wants to now go get out of the tunnels of Gaza after sacrificing tens of thousands [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  of his own people to turn global opinion against Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=152.72s)]
*  That was always their strategy and plan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=156.66s)]
*  And the Biden-Harris administration have played right into it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=159.12s)]
*  Now it's time to go live the good life, sitting in five-star hotels in Qatar, ponied up with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=162.88s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=169.64s)]
*  The most laughable line of the night was that she was going to be tough on Iran when it [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=170.64s)]
*  has been billions of dollars, concession after concession, using the Russians as an intermediary [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=174.96s)]
*  with the Iranians. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=181.48s)]
*  The Iranians are the original sin behind all of terrorism in the Middle East, backed by [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=183.0s)]
*  Chinese money. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=187.76s)]
*  And they haven't done a damn thing. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=189.04s)]
*  Five U.S. service members are in the hospital that were attacked just last week, and they [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=191.24s)]
*  haven't said a word. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  I want to move back home here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  Thomas Crooks, now dead. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=199.56s)]
*  Thankfully, his bullet did not land. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=202.52s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=205.72s)]
*  So now we know he's got encrypted messaging accounts with people in Belgium, people in [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=206.72s)]
*  Germany, people in New Zealand. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=210.84s)]
*  I don't know what you make of that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=212.16000000000003s)]
*  And I just want to roll this video of him at the rally along the souvenir line, I guess [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=213.86s)]
*  you could say, in Butler, PA, that day. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=218.44s)]
*  You say you are not satisfied with what you're hearing from the FBI. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=220.64s)]
*  What do you mean by that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=224.28s)]
*  Well, we've, we've had multiple FBI briefings now. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=225.28s)]
*  The task force just had one yesterday. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=230.04s)]
*  Of course, engagement with the Secret Service. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=232.92s)]
*  On the one hand, it's still shocking how little we know. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=235.56s)]
*  They still are not ready to talk to Crooks' motivation. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=239.12s)]
*  They have not been able to get into all of those encrypted accounts. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=243.44s)]
*  In the same breath, they're very quick to say he acted alone. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=247.96s)]
*  How did he build those IEDs and not trigger any type of alerts? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=252.68s)]
*  With a remote detonator, that was fully functional. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=257.32s)]
*  How was he able to establish these encrypted accounts and why and what were they doing? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=261.2s)]
*  And when you have this overlaid at the same time with ongoing Iranian plots, one of which [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=267.8s)]
*  was just intercepted last week with a Pakistani national that had put a down payment on Hitman [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=272.56s)]
*  were recruiting spotters, were recruiting protesters as a distraction. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=280.36s)]
*  I'm just not yet convinced and I don't see how they're coming to that conclusion so quickly, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=285.2s)]
*  given that in the same briefings, they're saying we still don't have very much information [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=289.96s)]
*  on him. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=294.76s)]
*  Well, more to come on that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=295.76s)]
*  We might get some news momentarily, so we'll just wait on that and confirm what we're hearing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=297.0s)]
*  about the Secret Service and how far they've gotten in their investigation. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=301.36s)]
*  Sir, thank you. Michael Walz. Nice to see you, sir. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aWp8NoGQAV4&t=305.04s)]
