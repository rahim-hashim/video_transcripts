# Gov. Josh Shapiro: We need to be strong against Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo)
*  All right. In the meantime, I do want to go to Governor Joshua Piero, the Pennsylvania [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=0.0s)]
*  governor, kind enough to join us. Governor, so much going on today. I did want to get [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=3.84s)]
*  your thoughts on these developments in the Middle East and a lot of this pressure that's [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=7.96s)]
*  on Israel now to go slow, don't have a dramatic response to this missile attack today. What [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=12.24s)]
*  do you think of that? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=17.96s)]
*  Well, look, let's speak truth. Iran is the world's largest exporter of terrorism. One [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=19.52s)]
*  of their proxies has been Hezbollah. They've been launching rockets and missiles toward [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=25.8s)]
*  Israel now for the better part of the last year. And today's really unprecedented, unprovoked [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  attack by Iran is unacceptable, and it needs to be responded to. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=36.96s)]
*  That will be determined by others, certainly. But I think we need to be strong against Iran. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=42.56s)]
*  We need to be clear that Iran is a terrorist regime. Iran is not our friend. Iran is no [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=48.6s)]
*  one's friend in the peaceful world, and we've got to make sure that it is addressed. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=54.84s)]
*  So, you know, obviously we've got the vice presidential debate tonight. Governor, a lot [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=60.24s)]
*  of people were hoping that you would be that vice presidential candidate in that debate. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=65.2s)]
*  That's either here or there. I understand that. But this message coming today about [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=70.0s)]
*  now you have a port strike going on, you've got this turbulence in the Middle East again, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=75.04s)]
*  that seems to be a constant, and that it's just a messy environment for a debate where [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=80.26s)]
*  the Democratic candidate will be targeted. You are part of the problem. And you know [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=87.02000000000001s)]
*  how that goes. So how do you respond to that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=92.42s)]
*  Well, look, Neil, I would say there are serious challenges in the world, from overseas, as [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=95.26s)]
*  you and I spoke about at the beginning of this interview, to the port, which you just [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  mentioned. And these are serious times. And I think it calls for serious people to conduct [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=104.62s)]
*  serious work every single day. I know you won't find this to be a shock. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=110.78s)]
*  I don't think Donald Trump is a serious person. I don't think that he has serious ideas to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=116.22s)]
*  deal with these serious challenges that we face. And so I think you'll probably see tonight [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=122.14s)]
*  in this vice presidential debate a clear contrast between the vision of Kamala Harris and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=127.54s)]
*  Donald Trump. And I would hope that it would also be a reminder to people of the chaos [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=132.34s)]
*  that Donald Trump brought when he had the keys to the White House four years ago. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=137.98s)]
*  I don't think we want to go back to that. Just the fact that there are challenges in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=141.82s)]
*  world doesn't mean that Donald Trump has the solutions. I think many of these challenges [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  are as a result of Donald Trump's policies and things he set in motion. And we need serious [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=151.98000000000002s)]
*  people right now to address that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=157.82s)]
*  I think the alert here, Governor, is that you're not supporting Donald Trump. But thank [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=160.02s)]
*  you for clarifying that. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=163.78s)]
*  By the way, that's the second alert of the day, Neil. I had no idea you were an intern [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=166.10000000000002s)]
*  for Jimmy Carter. So we both provided some breaking news today. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  Indeed we did. And I show every year of that time. But let me ask you, Governor, while [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=173.9s)]
*  I have you, I always try to get a sense of the whole situation, our relationship with [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=178.9s)]
*  Israel. As you know, it's been tense at times at this administration and Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=187.18s)]
*  But Vice President Harris was saying on the stump today, I will always ensure Israel has [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=193.06s)]
*  the ability to defend itself against Iran. So obviously clearly supporting this effort [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=197.22s)]
*  to go after Iran and then a response of some sort to this missile attack. But there was [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=202.32s)]
*  some chafing last week, as you recall, when Israel moved into southern Lebanon to go after [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=207.06s)]
*  Hezbollah, take out the leader, without apprising the U.S. of this, that it comes and goes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=215.06s)]
*  In other words, it's very tense. Do you think it's very tense? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=223.3s)]
*  Yeah, I'm not sure I see it that way. I think it is really important to distinguish between [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=227.34s)]
*  standing with Israel and certainly Israel's right to defend itself against this type of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=233.9s)]
*  unprecedented aggression coming from Iran, a terrorist regime, and maybe some differences [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  from the leadership that is in charge of Israel. And I think that there is a real stark difference [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=246.29999999999998s)]
*  there. I think it is one thing to stand up and say to Bibi Netanyahu, I disagree with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=253.29999999999998s)]
*  a particular position or approach you've taken, and a whole other thing to maybe not [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=258.9s)]
*  stand with Israel. And so that is why it is clear Vice President Harris has made clear [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=264.98s)]
*  she stands with Israel and also expressed some concerns that she has and the administration [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=269.58000000000004s)]
*  has with some of the conduct of the government that is in charge now. I think it is important [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=275.66s)]
*  to distinguish between the two. Governor, Donald Trump has said none of this [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=280.46000000000004s)]
*  would be happening right now if he were president. Not the unrest going on in the Middle East [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=284.58000000000004s)]
*  and not the Ukraine war. None of that if he were president. What do you think of that? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=290.58s)]
*  I understand why Donald Trump says that, you know, to score political points, but there [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=295.58s)]
*  is actually no evidence to back up anything he claims for two reasons. Number one, when [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=299.62s)]
*  he was in charge, we had chaos at home and abroad. And second, he has offered absolutely [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=305.1s)]
*  no vision, no policy, no prescription for any of the challenges that we are seeing across [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=311.06s)]
*  the globe. I mean, just standing up and saying it wouldn't be happening if I was in charge [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=316.8s)]
*  is not an answer. And I think, quite frankly, statements like that, people have grown tired [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=321.32000000000005s)]
*  too. They've heard it from the beginning. All the big pronouncements he made about healthcare, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=326.92s)]
*  all the big pronouncements he made on other things, none of them end up coming true because [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=331.68s)]
*  he doesn't have the plans, the policy chops or the ability to get stuff done. And so I [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=337.36s)]
*  just think you're seeing more pontificating, you know, more of him just kind of being a [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=343.6s)]
*  blowhard on these things. Finally, I did want to get your take on fracking, a big issue [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=348.88s)]
*  in your state, sir. There have been inconsistent positions on the part of Kamala Harris, more [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=354.56s)]
*  friendly, more open to that now, very much opposed not too long ago. And I understand [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  politics and I understand, you know, trying to appeal to all types. But do you think that [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=365.32000000000005s)]
*  will boomerang on her in your state? Well, let me tell you, I'm an all of the above [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  energy governor. I understand the critical role that natural gas plays in our economy [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=376.0s)]
*  today. We're proud to be a net energy exporter in Pennsylvania. We're proud of what it does [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=381.2s)]
*  for our economy. We're proud of what it does for our national security, being able to be [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=386.68s)]
*  energy independent. I'm proud of the fact that we're producing more energy than ever [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=391.0s)]
*  before in this nation. That's something that is a sign of strength, not just in Pennsylvania, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=396.04s)]
*  but across the country. And I will tell you, another sign of strength is that Kamala Harris [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=401.40000000000003s)]
*  over the last four or five years has listened to the good people of Pennsylvania, listened [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=406.12s)]
*  to others across this country and recognized that she needed to shift her position on fracking [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=411.32000000000005s)]
*  and to do so not for some political expediency, but because I think she listened and learned. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=417.48s)]
*  I think listening and learning from people and changing your position as a result of [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=422.84s)]
*  that is a sign of political strength. And I'm pleased that Kamala Harris is going to strengthen [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=427.4s)]
*  our natural gas industry in Pennsylvania. And I'm pleased of her position that she's [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=433.23999999999995s)]
*  taken here in this campaign. Governor, thank you very much. Very good having you on. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRuQNEowxWo&t=437.64s)]
