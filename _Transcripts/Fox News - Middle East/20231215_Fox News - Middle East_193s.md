# Biden, Harris at odds over Israel-Hamas war, report claims
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0)
*  The president, vice president, and national security advisor all weighing in on how Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=0.0s)]
*  should conduct its war against Hamas, their push to wind down fighting in Gaza, creating [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=7.28s)]
*  tension with our ally Israel and its Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=13.36s)]
*  Earlier this week, President Biden warned that Israel is starting to lose global support [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=18.92s)]
*  by the indiscriminate bombing that takes place. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=24.52s)]
*  And then this yesterday. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=28.4s)]
*  Do you want Israel to scale back its assault on Gaza by the end of the year? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=31.2s)]
*  Do you want them to tone it down, move to a lower intensity phase? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=35.64s)]
*  I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives, not stop going after Hamas, but be [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=40.16s)]
*  more careful. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  At the same time, there may also be division within the White House. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=48.56s)]
*  Politico reporting, Vice President Kamala Harris wants the White House to be more sympathetic [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=53.56s)]
*  toward Palestinians. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=58.56s)]
*  Peter Ducey live at the White House with this one. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=59.84s)]
*  Hey, Peter. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=62.08s)]
*  Julie, it sounds like President Biden and Vice President Harris have plenty to talk [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=63.08s)]
*  about at their private lunch in the president's dining room later on this afternoon because [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=66.68s)]
*  Politico has this item. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=71.32s)]
*  Part of it, we copy pasted, says this. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=73.08s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris has been telling colleagues in the administration that she [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=75.44s)]
*  wants the White House to show more concern publicly for the humanitarian damage in Gaza, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=79.82s)]
*  where Israel is locked in a bloody and prolonged battle with Hamas, according to three people [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=84.3s)]
*  familiar with Harris's comments. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=88.74s)]
*  President Joe Biden is among the officials. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  Harris has urged to show more sensitivity to Palestinian civilians, these people said. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=94.46s)]
*  Why does something around here leak that the vice president is upset with the president [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=99.46s)]
*  without Gaza? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=105.33999999999999s)]
*  And that's a great question, because I just I mean, if I if I could answer a question [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=106.86s)]
*  why somebody would leak, I mean, that would make me pretty smart and a lot smarter than [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=113.78s)]
*  I am. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=117.68s)]
*  She's part of the team. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=118.68s)]
*  And if she wasn't offering her advice and counsel to the president on innumerable issues, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=119.68s)]
*  that would be a story. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=125.14s)]
*  Ted Cruz saw this story about potential, a potential rift between the president and VP. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  And he tells Fox since day one, Biden administration officials have been pathologically obsessed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=134.22s)]
*  with undermining Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=139.26s)]
*  Unfortunately and infuriatingly, that obsession continues in the aftermath of Hamas's atrocities [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=140.82s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=146.98s)]
*  The costs for America and Israel's national security are catastrophic. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=148.34s)]
*  We don't expect to hear anything from President Biden or the press secretary about this today. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=153.58s)]
*  Nothing on camera on the schedule. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=159.18s)]
*  Julie? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=161.5s)]
*  You think get invited to that lunch? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=162.5s)]
*  I'd love to go to that one. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=165.1s)]
*  I'm sure they would love to have you at a table. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=166.5s)]
*  Just trying to open doors. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=169.38s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think they would really love that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=170.38s)]
*  Peter Doocy sitting down with the VP and president. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=172.62s)]
*  I bet I could get in like after the salad course. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=174.9s)]
*  Maybe you get their leftovers. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=179.06s)]
*  All right, Peter Doocy. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yNYhW4ujOT0&t=180.06s)]
