# Biden under fire after soldiers' deaths: 'No deterrence whatsoever'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8)
*  The White House is facing growing pressure to take decisive action after Iran-backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=0.0s)]
*  militants killed three U.S. service members and injured at least 34 more in a weekend [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=6.44s)]
*  drone strike. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=12.32s)]
*  That attack came on a small American outpost in northwestern Jordan, not far from the country's [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=13.82s)]
*  border with Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=18.48s)]
*  And we're now learning that the enemy drone was mistaken for an American drone, allowing [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=20.76s)]
*  it to slip past the outpost air defenses. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=25.8s)]
*  The forces in the region have been targeted at least 160 times since mid-October, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=29.72s)]
*  now President Biden is vowing to respond. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=39.0s)]
*  I'm Kayleigh McEnany, here with my co-host Emily Campagno and Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=40.36s)]
*  Also joining us, Fox News contributor and host of Tommy Lahren is fearless on outkick [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=45.12s)]
*  Tommy Lahren, and Fox News contributor and senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Mark Thiessen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  But first, let's go live to Peter Ducey at the White House with more details. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=56.72s)]
*  Peter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=60.08s)]
*  Kayleigh, when President Biden says that the U.S. is going to respond at a time and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=61.08s)]
*  manner of our choosing, that is something he's going to have to coordinate with the [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=64.16s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, who we just heard from for the first time back at work [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=67.0s)]
*  since a few weeks of recovering from prostate cancer surgery. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=71.84s)]
*  Let me start with my outrage and sorrow for the deaths of three brave U.S. troops in Jordan [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=76.92s)]
*  and for the other troops who were wounded. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=84.84s)]
*  The President and I will not tolerate attack on U.S. forces, and we will take all necessary [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  actions to defend the U.S. and our troops. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  Mitch McConnell has an idea about how to do that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=97.52s)]
*  He says, our enemies are emboldened and they will remain so until the United States imposes [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=99.52s)]
*  serious crippling costs not only on frontline terrorist proxies, but on their Iranian sponsors [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=103.68s)]
*  who wear American blood as a badge of honor. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=110.0s)]
*  John Cornyn, even more direct, he just posts, target Tehran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=112.84s)]
*  And we have no reason to think an attack against the Iranian homeland is coming. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=116.76s)]
*  But administration officials tracking these attacks that are bankrolled by Iran are well [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=120.92s)]
*  aware they are becoming more dangerous. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=125.56s)]
*  I certainly can't deny the fact that there have been a series of attacks now increasingly [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=129.12s)]
*  lethal over weeks and months, which is why the president is going to be reviewing what [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=134.20000000000002s)]
*  the appropriate response is going forward. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=138.20000000000002s)]
*  The fact this is happening today, January 29th, means that Iran is just ignoring President [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=141.0s)]
*  Biden's warnings on January 12th and on October 11th. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=145.64s)]
*  And as Iran has acted up over this president's first term, he has said that the United States [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  is prepared to defend its interests. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=154.88s)]
*  But at the same time, he has also said that the United States does not want a conflict [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=162.27999999999997s)]
*  Kayleigh? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=163.27999999999997s)]
*  KAYLEIGH JOHNSON, CNN NEWS ANCHOR, The Washington Post. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=164.27999999999997s)]
*  Peter Ducey, thank you. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=165.27999999999997s)]
*  Mark, so let's talk about President Biden's response. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=166.27999999999997s)]
*  He has struck the Islamic resistance, which is the area we're talking about, the Iranian [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  proxy and the Houthis. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=174.84s)]
*  I believe it's eight and nine times, respectively. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=175.84s)]
*  But a political piece took us inside his decision to strike the Houthis after they harassed [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=179.04s)]
*  U.S. ships, commercial ships. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=184.48s)]
*  And something stood out to me in it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=187.12s)]
*  So, Politico, inside Biden's decision to strike the Houthis, the Thursday strike, this was [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=188.16s)]
*  mid-January, ended weeks of growing pressure on Biden to respond militarily to Houthi attacks. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=192.76s)]
*  The U.S. military had drawn up more forceful options. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=198.2s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=200.64s)]
*  As early as the first week of December, but at this point, senior Biden officials agreed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=201.64s)]
*  striking the Houthis directly was not the best course. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=206.2s)]
*  The piece goes on to say even when he ordered the strike, it took more than seven days to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=209.4s)]
*  get a plan of action deployed. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=213.88s)]
*  And at one point in one of the strikes, he warned them ahead of time so they wouldn't [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=215.32s)]
*  kill anybody just to take out the missiles. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=218.28s)]
*  I mean, this is such weakness. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  They first of all treating the Houthis like they're an independent actor just shows complete [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=222.56s)]
*  incompetence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=227.64s)]
*  They are a wholly owned subsidiary of the Iranian regime. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=228.64s)]
*  They would not be striking U.S. forces if it wasn't our direct orders from Tehran. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=231.6s)]
*  So when Donald Trump was president, he drew a very clear red line. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=236.83999999999997s)]
*  He said to the Iranian regime, if either you or your proxies kill a single American, we [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=240.72s)]
*  will not respond against your proxies. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=245.6s)]
*  We will respond against Iran. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=247.29999999999998s)]
*  And when they crossed that red line, he took out Qassem Soleimani, the terrorist mastermind [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=249.04s)]
*  of the Iranian regime. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=252.88s)]
*  And guess what happened? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=253.88s)]
*  Everyone's terrified that, you know, we could get into a broader war. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=254.88s)]
*  The Iranian's back down and we and he brokered not one, not two, not three, four Arab-Israeli [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=257.91999999999996s)]
*  peace accords because the Iranian regime doesn't want to get into a war with the United States [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=264.11999999999995s)]
*  because they know they'd be crushed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=268.88s)]
*  They can't afford to get into a war. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=270.52s)]
*  So if you project strength and you impose a cost on the Iranians, you don't give them [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=272.11999999999995s)]
*  a hundred and sixty tries. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=275.76s)]
*  And then when the hundred and sixty first when they kill an American, then you go after [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=277.08s)]
*  the proxies. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=280.44s)]
*  The first time they do it, you take you take a strike at Iran and you should. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=281.55999999999995s)]
*  The message to Tehran should be every time an American dies, Qassem Soleimani's successor [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=285.16s)]
*  dies too. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=289.0s)]
*  And we will the most dangerous job in the world is to be Quds Force commander. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=290.0s)]
*  Yeah, well said. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=292.44000000000005s)]
*  And I mean, Harris, as Keith Kellogg told me, my former colleague, he said, you know, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=293.44000000000005s)]
*  yes, it was it was killing Soleimani. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  But on top of that, we publicly broadcast there are 52 Iranian targets. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=299.76000000000005s)]
*  We backchanneled to the Swiss and said, guess who's next? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=303.36s)]
*  Khamenei, the supreme leader. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=307.24s)]
*  For every one of the hostages that had been taken in 1979. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=308.32000000000005s)]
*  He took the number of targets and he tweeted it out. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=311.64000000000004s)]
*  I've selected a number of targets for every one of the hostages you took in 1979. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=313.96s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  That is understanding that you can couple what your response is right back. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=318.91999999999996s)]
*  You can retaliate, you know, an eye for an eye. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=323.76s)]
*  Yeah, you can do that with that specificity and let your enemy know that I'm serious. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=326.52s)]
*  Yeah. When you're arbitrary. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=331.56s)]
*  I mean, try to teach a kid anything. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=333.28s)]
*  If you're arbitrary, you certainly can't potty train them. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=335.91999999999996s)]
*  You got to have a plan. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=338.35999999999996s)]
*  But I would say this. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=340.68s)]
*  This takes me back to the time, the spring, right after Biden was in office, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=341.68s)]
*  when we heard tale of troops along the border between Russia and Ukraine. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=345.68s)]
*  And then by October of that year, we heard that there were north of 100000 of them. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  And then by Christmas, we heard that there were one hundred and fifty thousand of them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=356.32000000000005s)]
*  And by February, what were they doing? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=360.88s)]
*  Yeah, they were invading. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=362.76000000000005s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  So look, we can sit back and they can hit us one hundred and sixty plus times [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=365.52000000000004s)]
*  since October 17th. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=370.32s)]
*  We retaliate about 15 times or so half measure. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=372.08s)]
*  And now, as Jennifer Griffin reported to me last hour, oh, you know, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=375.96s)]
*  there's an indication that they've turned the corner. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=379.56s)]
*  But she reminded me, but Harris, it's all up to Biden. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=381.4s)]
*  So all the generals, everybody can give those plans that you're talking about, Kayleigh. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=383.96s)]
*  But it's finally his decision. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=387.71999999999997s)]
*  What will he choose? Remember Afghanistan? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=389.92s)]
*  He was given a different way out. Yeah. Which way did he choose? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=391.88s)]
*  Yeah. And he his favorite word seems to be don't. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=394.84s)]
*  It's a word that the Iranians don't seem to understand. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=398.03999999999996s)]
*  It's not really a foreign policy philosophy or worldview, but here he goes. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=400.28s)]
*  Let's watch him. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=403.68s)]
*  And what's the message to Iran? Don't. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=407.0s)]
*  It was very important to send a very clear message [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=410.0s)]
*  to anyone who might seek to take advantage of the conflict in Gaza [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  to threaten our personnel here or anywhere else in the region. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=417.79999999999995s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=422.0s)]
*  What is your message to Hezbollah and its backer, Iran? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=423.28s)]
*  Don't. Don't, don't, don't. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=428.12s)]
*  I've already delivered the message to Iran. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=436.08s)]
*  They know not to do anything. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=437.84s)]
*  Emily, so they don't understand the word don't, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=440.52s)]
*  but they do understand the unfreezing of the six billion, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=442.32s)]
*  the not enforcing the oil sanctions, the delisting of the Houthis. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=445.24s)]
*  They understand those weak actions. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=448.76s)]
*  That's right. What they understand is that there is no deterrence whatsoever [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=450.4s)]
*  on the part of this administration. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=454.32s)]
*  What they understand is that any message whatsoever [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=456.4s)]
*  coming from this administration, if it's anything less than abject weakness, [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=459.35999999999996s)]
*  that's what it means. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=463.96s)]
*  The sad reality is that these deaths are the result of Biden's policies. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=465.44s)]
*  They are the result of his fear of escalation. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=469.52s)]
*  Every decision coming out of this administration is a fear of something [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=472.52s)]
*  and it is a fear of escalation. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=477.47999999999996s)]
*  And therefore, there is no peace through strength. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=479.67999999999995s)]
*  There is no message behind it of actual deterrence. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=482.12s)]
*  And the reality is that he has been warned for quite some time [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=485.32s)]
*  that the inevitable would happen and the inevitable was American deaths. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=488.32s)]
*  And especially in the form of these drones that were mistaken for our own. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=491.64s)]
*  And I agree with you wholeheartedly. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=495.32s)]
*  I also agree with Senator Tom Cotton, who said the only answer to these attacks [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=497.24s)]
*  must be devastating military retaliation against Iran's terrorist forces. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=501.36s)]
*  Anything less will confirm Joe Biden as a coward, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  unworthy of being commander in chief. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=509.03999999999996s)]
*  We have appeased Iran. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=511.28s)]
*  We have capitulated to their demands. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=512.76s)]
*  We have paid for all of this through back channels and up front. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=514.44s)]
*  There is zero anything at all. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=517.9200000000001s)]
*  Any decision we've ever made that has put anything less than set the table [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=520.4000000000001s)]
*  for these horrific deaths. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=524.2s)]
*  And when the president says, God bless our troops or my heart is heavy, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=525.2800000000001s)]
*  it means nothing to me. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=529.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, Tommy, in life, there is cause and there is effect. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=530.44s)]
*  And I thought, how best can we illustrate this? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=534.0400000000001s)]
*  So I asked for us to pull up these series of headlines. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=536.0400000000001s)]
*  Look at this. Onra, that's the UN refugee body. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=538.5200000000001s)]
*  The United States announces restoration of US [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=541.7199999999999s)]
*  150 million to support Palestine refugees. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=545.2399999999999s)]
*  That's under Biden. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=548.16s)]
*  So they restored funding in the Trump administration cut. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=549.3599999999999s)]
*  Well, what happens? NPR 12 onra staff members are accused of involvement [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=551.56s)]
*  in Hamas attack against Israel. Despicable. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=555.52s)]
*  Then you move on over to the Houthis. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=557.88s)]
*  PBS informed policy shift. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=559.28s)]
*  Biden lifts terror designation for Houthis. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=560.92s)]
*  Then what happens? Here we go. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=563.88s)]
*  AP Houthi rebels strike the US own ship off the coast. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=565.2399999999999s)]
*  Cause effect. Biden is the connective tissue. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=568.24s)]
*  You think after the withdrawal from Afghanistan, the disastrous withdrawal, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=571.8399999999999s)]
*  this administration would have learned their lesson, but they don't. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=576.88s)]
*  And speaking of don't, that's all this president can say. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=580.1999999999999s)]
*  Don't and we shall respond. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=583.4399999999999s)]
*  Three US service members lost their lives, their families grieving. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=586.0s)]
*  And the most he can say is we shall respond or don't. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=590.28s)]
*  He stands there in a cafe with a smoothie and says don't. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=594.16s)]
*  And that is supposed to give us comfort as Americans. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=598.24s)]
*  That's supposed to give our allies comfort. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=600.76s)]
*  No, it gives our enemies comfort. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=602.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, to my Labradoodle, I say don't. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=604.4399999999999s)]
*  And my Labradoodle has more respect for me than Iran has for Joe Biden. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=607.36s)]
*  And my Labradoodle is going to do whatever he wants to do when I say don't, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=610.8s)]
*  because he quite simply doesn't care. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=613.68s)]
*  He wishes he could. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=616.0s)]
*  But when Biden sits there and says don't. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=617.2s)]
*  And then when we talk about Lloyd Austin and you talk about, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=619.4399999999999s)]
*  oh, he's just now returned. Well, that's wonderful. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  We're all praying for his health. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=625.72s)]
*  But I can't help but think what if this had happened [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=627.28s)]
*  and we lost three service members a couple of weeks ago and no one knew where he was. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=629.68s)]
*  So it gives us no comfort. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=633.5999999999999s)]
*  It gives our enemies a lot of comfort. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=634.8399999999999s)]
*  And the most we hear from our president is don't. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=636.8s)]
*  Don't. And then this, Mark, I just want to throw this to you. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=639.7199999999999s)]
*  We can't leave without this. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=642.4s)]
*  This is a White House administration official. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=643.2399999999999s)]
*  They do these background briefings at the White House with reporters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=645.12s)]
*  So this is January 12th. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=647.7199999999999s)]
*  And here's what they had to say in terms of consequences on Iran. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=649.0s)]
*  We have a longstanding and deep pressure campaign [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=652.28s)]
*  that the United States has conducted. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=655.4399999999999s)]
*  Do they have a longstanding and deep pressure campaign? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=657.12s)]
*  They do not. I mean, they they would. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=659.4000000000001s)]
*  The Trump did. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=661.24s)]
*  They had only like seven billion dollars in assets when when he [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=662.6800000000001s)]
*  when he left office and state assets and they're up in the tens of billions now. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=666.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's the money they give to all the proxies. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=669.64s)]
*  I mean, I think both Tommy and Harris hit it on the head. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=671.48s)]
*  It starts. All these things are connected. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=674.08s)]
*  It starts in Afghanistan. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=675.84s)]
*  You project weakness in Afghanistan. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=677.08s)]
*  That emboldens Putin to go into Ukraine. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=678.64s)]
*  Then Biden refuses to give the Ukrainians the weapons they need to win. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=681.12s)]
*  If he had given them everything that we're giving them now [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=685.2s)]
*  in the summer of 2022, they would have won the war by now when Russia was on its heels. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=687.92s)]
*  Instead, he lets the Russians. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=691.76s)]
*  He doesn't want to win. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=693.7199999999999s)]
*  He just wants to not lose. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=694.76s)]
*  And that sends a message to Iran, which then emboldens them to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=696.7199999999999s)]
*  Hamas to carry out the attacks of October 7th. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=700.8399999999999s)]
*  And then we don't do anything after 160 strikes. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  And finally, they kill an American. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=706.8399999999999s)]
*  It starts in Afghanistan, goes through Kiev, goes to Tehran, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=708.2399999999999s)]
*  goes to Hamas, goes and then goes to that base in Jordan. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=712.04s)]
*  It's all connected. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=715.8s)]
*  In Biden's world, it is a very scary place. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lczWb3fgac8&t=716.96s)]
