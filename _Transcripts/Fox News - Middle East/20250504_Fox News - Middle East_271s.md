# 'Very limited options' if Iran obtains nuclear weapons, national security expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M)
*  Welcome back, America. So if they got these ICBMs, which they will, unless we stop them, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=0.0s)]
*  they're going to have ICBM, Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, and they get these nuclear [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=7.2s)]
*  warheads, which they will, unless we stop them. They'll be able to hit the United States [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=10.44s)]
*  at some point, but they'll also be able to blackmail us, create economic havoc, cut off [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=17.52s)]
*  certain navigable waters, make threats. And what do we do then? Now they have nuclear [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=22.16s)]
*  weapons. What do we do then? That's a practical matter. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, if passed as prologue, we'd have very limited options, which is why it's an imperative [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=29.04s)]
*  for not just this administration, but successive U.S. administrations for them not to obtain [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=34.76s)]
*  a weapon. They would functionally operate under a nuclear umbrella, meaning the consequences [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=38.84s)]
*  of taking any action against regional terrorism, disruption to trade, as you point out, which [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  is our vital national security interest, and the heartbeat of the global economy, whether [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=47.16s)]
*  we like it or not, all of that would be thrown into the hazard. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=51.64s)]
*  And to your point in terms of development of a nuclear armed ICBM capable of reaching [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=55.06s)]
*  the United States, most estimates state they're 12 months out. But our ability to guess, of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=59.96s)]
*  course, is been an imperfect track record, to say the least. We've never been able to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=65.06s)]
*  successfully anticipate a partner, ally or adversary developing a nuclear weapon. Our [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=69.86s)]
*  track record is 100 percent, and it's a failure. And so we should be extremely cautious about [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=74.38s)]
*  estimates, but the risk is real. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=79.5s)]
*  I would say, too, that they only back down when confronted with force. The myth of a [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=81.58000000000001s)]
*  regional war as a result of it is just that, Iranian and Obama era talking points facing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=85.14s)]
*  a false dichotomy. They, when confronted with force, they back down, and that is the four [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=90.30000000000001s)]
*  decade history of the regime. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=95.06s)]
*  And aren't they in the weakest position, really, they ever have been in terms of a military [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  strike if the president wants to take that position? It will not only get worse and much [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=102.18s)]
*  more difficult as time goes on. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=107.10000000000001s)]
*  There's no question, not only was Iran fundamentally weak all along, as Israel pointed out in response [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=109.54s)]
*  to the May and October missile strikes, drone and cruise missile attacks against them, also [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  the largest use of ballistic missiles from one state against another, and another reason [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=121.22s)]
*  why we would believe that they might use nuclear weapons if they had them. But it certainly [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=125.2s)]
*  points out that as Israeli strikes indicated that it can be done, war doesn't result in [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=129.52s)]
*  that we can, in fact, have freedom of action and operational flexibility inside of Iranian [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=134.18s)]
*  airspace if we need to do so. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=138.5s)]
*  They are a patient that has been anesthetized. Operations can commence at much lower risk [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=140.54s)]
*  as a result of it. And with Hezbollah and Hamas now nearly eliminated, we now have greatly [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=145.06s)]
*  diminished the capacity of them to respond. And that deterrence capacity is eliminated. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=151.5s)]
*  And with Syria falling and the land bridge connecting to Hezbollah, they are at certainly [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=156.17999999999998s)]
*  the weakest position they've been in at least three decades. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  And the response to you, Robert Greenway, as the response to so many smart people who [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=163.58s)]
*  are conservatives, who are Republicans, who have been looking at this through their experience [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=168.54s)]
*  and so forth is, oh, you must be a warmonger. Oh, you must support forever wars. In other [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=174.7s)]
*  words, you get cliches. You get slogans. You really don't get substantive, knowledgeable [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=179.94s)]
*  that dissuade or in any way significantly challenge what you're saying. In other words, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=189.26s)]
*  what you're saying is a fact. It's unequivocal. It's not debatable, which is why President [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=194.82s)]
*  Trump is saying we've got to stop them from getting nukes. And yet others are out there [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=200.1s)]
*  acting like, well, that's just because you're an ideologue and an old-time... Is that where [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=205.14s)]
*  you are? You're a warmonger? Is that why you're concerned about this? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=210.22s)]
*  Well, after six years of combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, I'm not enthusiastic about any [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=213.06s)]
*  more or sending U.S. blood and treasure abroad, but I don't think that's what's required. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=218.02s)]
*  I don't think that's what would result. And again, four decades of history have demonstrated [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=222.26000000000002s)]
*  that Iran will back down only when confronted with force. They accelerate their aggressiveness [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=226.54000000000002s)]
*  when they meet weakness, and that's the point. And so I hope that we won't flinch, and I'm [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=231.5s)]
*  sure President Trump understands the Iranians full well and will not. The only acceptable [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=236.02s)]
*  amount of enrichment for the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism is zero. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=240.26000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and you and many others are literally trying to defend America, defend our ally [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=244.18s)]
*  Israel, defend the West is really what we're up against. Thank you, my brother. You take [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=249.62s)]
*  care of yourself. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=253.98000000000002s)]
*  My pleasure. Thanks for having me, Mark. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=255.22s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6GfrdPVo1M&t=257.58s)]
