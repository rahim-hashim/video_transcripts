# 'BRAINWASHED': Journalist details interviews with Hamas fighters, other terrorists
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM)
*  Pierre Rejave is a French reporter who has been covering conflict in the Middle East [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=0.0s)]
*  for 25 years and joins us now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Pierre, good morning to you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=7.08s)]
*  First of all, you live about 10 miles from the Gaza Strip during this incredibly tense [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=8.08s)]
*  time. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=12.76s)]
*  So what has life been like for you right now? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=13.76s)]
*  It's kind of tense once in a while I would say because we have rocket alerts. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=18.28s)]
*  I just had a rocket alert about 30 minutes ago and since every house in my city has a [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=23.2s)]
*  shelter, each time we have to rush to the shelter. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=29.64s)]
*  In the case of this morning, I was out walking the dogs and the rockets exploded above my [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=32.6s)]
*  head. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=38.44s)]
*  So there were shrapnels all over. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=39.32s)]
*  That's one thing to understand, which is that the Iron Dome is actually destroying most [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=41.4s)]
*  of the rockets sent to civilian population from Hamas and from other terror organizations [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  within Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=53.32s)]
*  But when they explode, it's not the end of the story. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=54.6s)]
*  Then you have the shrapnels falling on the ground. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=57.32s)]
*  Imagine pieces of metal really hard falling from one mile altitude. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=60.04s)]
*  So it's it's causing a lot of damages. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=66.84s)]
*  I saw three burning, getting a fire this morning because of one of those rockets. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=69.08s)]
*  Well, Pierre, you are one of just a few journalists who have interviewed dozens of Hamas, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=74.84s)]
*  Islamic Jihad and Al Qaeda terrorists for a documentary you released called Suicide Killers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=80.52000000000001s)]
*  The psychology of a terrorist is something that is impossible to understand. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=86.2s)]
*  But what did you learn through these interviews? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=90.36s)]
*  Well, it's at the same time simple and complicated. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=94.44s)]
*  Those people live in a very oppressive society. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=97.64s)]
*  Their childhood is very often stolen by their parents. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=100.44s)]
*  They are brainwashed in school, in mosques, that brainwash at every single level of their [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=103.72s)]
*  society. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=108.6s)]
*  So the end result is that at a certain point in their life, they believe that in order [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=109.48s)]
*  to have a normal life that they cannot have on Earth, they need to kill other people and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=113.64s)]
*  eventually kill themselves because they have interviewed a lot of suicide killers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=118.44s)]
*  And they think that actually, and it's not a myth, if they go kill some Jews, some non-Muslims, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=122.2s)]
*  they're going to end up in heaven surrounded by 72 virgins and they will have lakes of wine and [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=131.0s)]
*  everything they cannot access to on Earth, which is forbidden by their religion, would be all of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=137.8s)]
*  a sudden allowed on the other side. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=142.6s)]
*  But I want to add something. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=144.44s)]
*  When we are talking about terrorists, we are talking about people that I met, a lot of them [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=146.35999999999999s)]
*  who were trying to kill, whether it's children or soldiers or innocent people or whatever, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=151.32s)]
*  they were trying to kill. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=157.88s)]
*  In the case of what happened on October 7, it was not only terrorists. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=159.24s)]
*  It was a massacre. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=163.4s)]
*  It was a pogrom. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  They tortured women. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=165.88s)]
*  They tortured kids. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=167.32s)]
*  They put them on fire. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=168.35999999999999s)]
*  They burned them to death. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=169.48s)]
*  This is much beyond terrorism. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=172.12s)]
*  It's no longer simple terrorism. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=174.04s)]
*  It's barbaria. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=175.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=176.76s)]
*  It's absolutely horrific what they have done and what they say that they're going to continue to do. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  And Israel says that their goal is to root out Hamas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=183.08s)]
*  But the question does remain. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=186.76s)]
*  Can you root out an ideology? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  Can you kill it? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=190.6s)]
*  Well, unfortunately, what has been happening in the Palestinian territories is that for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=193.32s)]
*  so many years, people have been lying about it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=197.88s)]
*  I'm sorry to say that a lot of media have been taking the side of the Palestinians [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=200.6s)]
*  without knowing anything of what was really happening over there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=204.28s)]
*  And in Palestinian textbooks, sometimes financed by European Union or by UNRWA, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  you have a lot of pages teaching the kids that Israel doesn't have the right to exist, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=215.24s)]
*  that Jews are monsters, and that they should be killed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=220.28s)]
*  So it's at every level of the society. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=223.32s)]
*  I believe that once Israel has gotten rid of Hamas and other terror organizations within Gaza, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=226.84s)]
*  international communities should put together a government, a temporary government, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=235.08s)]
*  making sure that all this incitement on television, in the mosque, at school, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=240.36s)]
*  within every single habitation is going to disappear. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=245.32s)]
*  So in a couple or three generations, people over there will be actually ready for the very [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=248.76s)]
*  simple existence of Israel, since Israel doesn't want to destroy them, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=253.8s)]
*  but they want to destroy Israel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=257.16s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=258.44s)]
*  It's a very simple equation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=259.16s)]
*  Understood. Pierre Rejava, fascinating perspective from you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=260.04s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=262.76s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=265.0s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=265.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M7I1OsCStkM&t=266.2s)]
