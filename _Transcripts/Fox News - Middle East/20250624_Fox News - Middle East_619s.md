# 'FURIOUS': Hosts react after Trump drops F-bomb
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU)
*  Straight to a Fox News alert, President Trump says he's unhappy, unhappy with both Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=0.0s)]
*  and Iran, saying both nations violated their bilateral ceasefire agreement. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=5.76s)]
*  The president warning Israel that any military action will go against the deal after a senior [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=10.86s)]
*  Israeli official told Fox News that they will have to retaliate with force against Iran's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  missiles. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=22.6s)]
*  So the president right now is heading to the Netherlands to meet with NATO leaders. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=23.6s)]
*  Here's what he said right before he left. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=27.88s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  I don't think so, but I'm not happy that Israel's going out now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  There was one rocket that I guess was fired overboard. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=34.68s)]
*  It was after the time limit and it missed its target. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=38.2s)]
*  And now Israel's going out. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=42.96s)]
*  These guys got to calm down. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  Ridiculous. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=46.08s)]
*  I didn't like plenty of things I saw yesterday. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=47.08s)]
*  I didn't like the fact that Israel unloaded right after we made the deal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  They didn't have to unload. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=55.68s)]
*  I didn't like the fact that the retaliation was very strong. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=57.64s)]
*  But in all fairness, Israel unloaded a lot. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=61.6s)]
*  And now I hear Israel just went out because they felt it was violated by one rocket that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=64.72s)]
*  didn't land anywhere. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=69.68s)]
*  That's not what we want, I'll tell you. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=71.54s)]
*  And I'm telling you, I'm not happy about that Israel either. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  All I do is clay both sides. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=75.6s)]
*  I'm going now, as you know, to NATO. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=80.08s)]
*  Some of you are going with me and I think it's going to be successful. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=82.62s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=85.92s)]
*  I'll let you know. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=87.04s)]
*  Are you going to be the agreement if the new God in the Middle East sent you the agreement [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=88.04s)]
*  you managed to achieve? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=92.8s)]
*  What are your future plans for the region, for Saudi Arabia, Israel, Gaza, be hostages? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=94.76s)]
*  Look, you're asking me about women in the Middle East. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=99.44s)]
*  It's getting a lot better. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=102.8s)]
*  Things are happening at a high level. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=104.16s)]
*  As you know, Saudi Arabia has done a really good job. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=105.88s)]
*  It's coming out far, far faster than I thought. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=108.92s)]
*  So we're very happy about what's happening with women in the Middle East. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=113.22s)]
*  I'm talking about the anisone in the Middle East that you managed to achieve last night. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=116.24s)]
*  The region is going to a new place with the Pacific agreements. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=122.0s)]
*  Can you tell us what the plan for Gaza is? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=125.52s)]
*  It's a new dawn. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=129.6s)]
*  I appreciate the question. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=130.6s)]
*  You're very nice. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=131.6s)]
*  Who are you? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=132.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=133.6s)]
*  I'm Nariyat Rost from Israeli Tunnel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=134.6s)]
*  We have to have Israel calm down because they went on a mission this morning. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=135.6s)]
*  I got to get Israel to calm down now. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=139.36s)]
*  Did you talk to Prime Minister Netanyahu last night? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=142.28s)]
*  I spoke to everybody. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=146.28s)]
*  You're both sides not to violate the ceasefire, but reports coming from the region suggest [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=147.28s)]
*  that the sides accuse each other for violating the ceasefire. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=156.12s)]
*  So I think they both violated it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think they, I'm not sure they did it intentionally. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=162.36s)]
*  They couldn't rein people back. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=164.72s)]
*  I don't like the fact that Israel went out this morning at all. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=166.4s)]
*  And I'm going to see if I can stop it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=169.4s)]
*  So as soon as I get away from you, I'm going to see if I can stop it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=171.6s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=175.04s)]
*  What are you talking about, Mr. Netanyahu? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=176.04s)]
*  You're talking about how confident you are in the United States, but others have been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=177.04s)]
*  completely demolished. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=182.04s)]
*  I think it's been completely demolished. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=183.12s)]
*  I think the reason we're here is because those pilots, those B-2 pilots did an unbelievable [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=184.88s)]
*  job. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=190.12s)]
*  And, you know, the fake news, like CNN in particular, they're trying to, you know, they're [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=191.12s)]
*  trying to say, well, I agree that it was destroyed, but maybe not that destroyed. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=195.2s)]
*  You know what they're doing? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=200.28s)]
*  They're probably hurting great pilots that put their lives in the line. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=201.96s)]
*  CNN is scum. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  And so is MSDNC. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=206.08s)]
*  They're all. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=207.08s)]
*  And, frankly, the networks aren't much better. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=208.08s)]
*  It's all fake news, but they should not have done that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=210.92000000000002s)]
*  Those pilots hit their targets. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=214.36s)]
*  Those targets were obliterated. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  And the pilots should be given credit. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=217.84s)]
*  They're not after the pilots. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=219.8s)]
*  They're after me. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=220.8s)]
*  They want to try and demean. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=221.8s)]
*  Do you believe that Iran can rebuild its nuclear program? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=222.8s)]
*  No, Iran will never rebuild its nuclear. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=225.28s)]
*  From there? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=228.04s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=229.04s)]
*  That place is under rock. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  That place is demolished. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=231.79999999999998s)]
*  The B-2 pilots did their job. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=233.51999999999998s)]
*  They did it better than anybody could even imagine. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=235.48s)]
*  They hit late in the evening. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=237.79999999999998s)]
*  It was dark with no moon. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  And they hit that target with every one of those things. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=241.92s)]
*  And that place is gone. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=244.44s)]
*  But when I see CNN all night long, they're trying to say, well, maybe it wasn't really [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=246.64s)]
*  as demolished as we thought it was demolished. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=251.23999999999998s)]
*  You take a look at the pinpricks and you see that place is gone. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=254.32s)]
*  And I will say, I think CNN ought to apologize to the pilots of the B-2s. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=258.64000000000004s)]
*  I think that MSDNC ought to apologize. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=263.64000000000004s)]
*  I think these guys really, these networks, these cable networks are real losers. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=267.24s)]
*  You really are. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=273.36s)]
*  You're real losers. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=274.36s)]
*  It's real sense that they violated the B-2. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=275.36s)]
*  You're gutless losers. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=279.6s)]
*  I say that to CNN because I watch it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=280.68s)]
*  I have no choice. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=283.52000000000004s)]
*  I got to watch it garbage. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  It's all garbage. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  It's all fake news. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=286.52000000000004s)]
*  But I think CNN is a gutless group of people. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=287.92s)]
*  And the people that run it, nobody even knows it's been sold so many times. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=291.52s)]
*  But the people that run it ought to be ashamed. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=295.2s)]
*  MSDNC, a guy named Brian Roberts, he heads it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=297.24s)]
*  He's a disgrace. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=300.52s)]
*  He's a weak, pathetic disgrace. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=301.52s)]
*  He says that Iran violated the peace agreement and the ceasefire agreement. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=303.08s)]
*  Do you believe that Iran is still committed to cede? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=307.68s)]
*  Yeah, I do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=310.48s)]
*  They violated it, but Israel violated it, too. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=312.03999999999996s)]
*  Are you questioning if Israel is committed to cede? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=314.52s)]
*  As soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, the likes [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=316.72s)]
*  of which I'd never seen before. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=320.64000000000004s)]
*  The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=324.36s)]
*  When I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, you don't go out in the first hour and just drop [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=326.72s)]
*  everything you have on them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=331.52000000000004s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=332.76s)]
*  I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=334.36s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=336.32s)]
*  didn't land, that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land, I'm not happy about that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  You know what? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=346.4s)]
*  We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=349.08s)]
*  don't know what the f*** they're doing. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=354.44s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=356.52s)]
*  Wow, and there are two and a lot of people talking about the expletive at the end, but [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=357.52s)]
*  that's he just being honest. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  He's furious. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  I got the opportunity to just talk to him before we just went on air for the 8 o'clock [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=363.59999999999997s)]
*  hour and I said, I haven't seen you this upset in a while. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=367.23999999999995s)]
*  What's really going on? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=371.08s)]
*  He had just hung up with Bibi Netanyahu, the prime minister, and he said that the prime [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=373.08s)]
*  minister is bringing all the planes back. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=377.12s)]
*  I said, why are you so frustrated with Israel? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=379.52s)]
*  And he says because he didn't feel like it was good faith, that even though they still [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=381.35999999999996s)]
*  had some time until the ceasefire, that they essentially unloaded on Iran. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=385.59999999999997s)]
*  I said, what about Iran as it relates to some of the reports that they're still doing their [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=390.4s)]
*  program? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  He says they got to save face for the country. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=395.47999999999996s)]
*  They still got to appear to be strong. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=397.2s)]
*  But he goes, their program is done. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  He said, I probably fixed all of them when they hit their targets there. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=400.68s)]
*  But he goes, I'm not happy with both of them, but more so Israel because he goes, it's over. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  It's done. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=410.04s)]
*  The program is done. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=411.04s)]
*  Well, and he also said in that press conference that he's upset with Israel because Iran targeted [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=412.04s)]
*  them after the ceasefire, but it was one missile that went nowhere, he said. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=417.24s)]
*  So for Israel to retaliate against that when nothing happened with that Iranian missile, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=421.92s)]
*  he doesn't feel like that was in Israel's, they shouldn't have done that, he said. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=429.2s)]
*  I'm all for Israel hitting every target possible within those, with those final eight hours. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=434.32s)]
*  They got about 100 launchers hiding under tunnels as other people. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=440.03999999999996s)]
*  There's other assassinations got to take place. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=443.68s)]
*  These nuclear scientists got to go. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=445.91999999999996s)]
*  These higher commands got to go. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=448.02s)]
*  They spent their entire existence trying to kill Israelis and kill us. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=449.52s)]
*  And now with the president's referring to, and I think he's right, I don't know if they [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=452.91999999999996s)]
*  But when you have Iran's chief nuclear scientist, Mohammed Aslami, say on Tuesday, they're going [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=456.64s)]
*  to immediately tell Mir News, they're immediately going to start again with their nuclear program. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=462.56s)]
*  I mean, that's in your face to us and to Israel. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, we knew they were going to do that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=470.56s)]
*  We saw those trucks removing some of the enriched uranium out of the facilities. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=471.84s)]
*  That was before we hit. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=476.76s)]
*  My stomach confirmed that, exactly. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=477.76s)]
*  So where is that enriched uranium? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=478.76s)]
*  We saw those five planes go in from China, go into Iran. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=480.24s)]
*  Did they take enriched uranium back to China to protect it while Iran was preparing to [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=484.84s)]
*  get blasted? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=489.84s)]
*  Where is that enriched uranium? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=491.11999999999995s)]
*  But I have faith in this president and I appreciate hearing him say they will never have nuclear [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=492.11999999999995s)]
*  facilities again. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=498.28s)]
*  But here's the other issue. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=499.28s)]
*  They have to stop financing all their proxies. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=500.58s)]
*  Ceasefire is great, but if you want to get to the next step, I don't know how you enforce [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=503.88s)]
*  this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=507.71999999999997s)]
*  Hamas can't get another dollar. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=508.71999999999997s)]
*  Houthis can't get another dollar. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=509.71999999999997s)]
*  And Hezbollah can't get another dollar. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=511.67999999999995s)]
*  They did not back Iran when the chips were down. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=513.52s)]
*  Either did Russia and North Korea, either did China. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=516.96s)]
*  So we've got to make sure that they just can't reconstitute and we're not back here in 18 [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=521.14s)]
*  months. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=525.0s)]
*  But if they do, Israel has great intelligence. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=526.0s)]
*  We have intelligence. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=527.68s)]
*  We would know where it is. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=528.68s)]
*  And look what our military did on Saturday. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  They could do that again. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=532.04s)]
*  Well, it was very hard to take down. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=533.04s)]
*  What they did with Hezbollah, there's only going to be one pager operation, one walkie [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=535.0s)]
*  talkie operation. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=538.64s)]
*  They can't do this again. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=540.86s)]
*  They cannot get rocketed from both sides. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=542.02s)]
*  And Hamas has got to be finished. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=545.02s)]
*  And in a couple of weeks, I guess they're going to look to talk and get the final hostages [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=547.46s)]
*  out. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=550.86s)]
*  But they have no more money flowing to them right now, no more money flowing to Hezbollah. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=551.86s)]
*  If that stays the same, then we could watch these guys wither. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=555.38s)]
*  Lebanon could actually get Lebanon back. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=559.46s)]
*  Brian, you know from an ideology standpoint, I agree with you. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=561.54s)]
*  I agree with you that this is something that is deeply rooted in the radical Islamic ideology [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=565.3s)]
*  there in Iran and they're never going to stop. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=572.3s)]
*  But I do see the president's point of you got to get peace a shot because he's not [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=575.18s)]
*  only dealing with Iran, but he also has to at least appear to the Muslim world, to the [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=579.3s)]
*  UAE, to Egypt, to Jordan, that he's trying to get a close to this. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=585.78s)]
*  So working a lot of different factions. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=591.3199999999999s)]
*  But as you know, Iran is enemies to all those countries. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=594.46s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=597.5s)]
*  They just don't want to come out and say it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=598.5s)]
*  Because of their people. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=599.5s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=600.5s)]
*  The Ayatollah. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=601.5s)]
*  Most of the Iranians don't like this regime, but they have a lot of power. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=602.5s)]
*  The Mullahs and the clerics. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5TzaXkXHFU&t=606.74s)]
