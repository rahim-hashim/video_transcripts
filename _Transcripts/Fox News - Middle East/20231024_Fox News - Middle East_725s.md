# 10 unaccounted for Americans in Israel: John Kirby
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w)
*  So it has been said that history moves slowly and then all at once. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=0.0s)]
*  That is the scenario that the world might be looking at right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=9.48s)]
*  In his Oval Office speech on Thursday night, President Biden spoke of three fronts, essentially [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=13.06s)]
*  Iran, China, and Russia, saying that the world is watching what America does and how we respond. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=17.5s)]
*  The President has taught us that when terrorists don't pay a price for their terror, when [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=27.94s)]
*  dictators don't pay a price for their aggression, they cause more chaos and death and more destruction. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=31.94s)]
*  They keep going and the cost and the threats to America and the world keep rising. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=38.94s)]
*  Joining us now, John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for Strategic Communications. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=44.980000000000004s)]
*  John, welcome back. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=49.22s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  You know, both Senator McConnell and Congressman Kevin McCarthy referred to what the President [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=53.22s)]
*  described on Thursday night as the axis of evil. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=59.92s)]
*  Does the President consider those three countries to be the new axis of evil? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=63.9s)]
*  Does he agree? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=69.34s)]
*  I think the President would certainly characterize multiple countries, nation-states here, who [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=70.42s)]
*  present unique and pernicious threats and challenges to our national security. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=76.22s)]
*  North Korea is in that group, obviously Russia. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=82.06s)]
*  China certainly presents threats and challenges in the Indo-Pacific, but so does Iran. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  So I mean, we haven't slapped a name on that group, but those four countries clearly present [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=89.86s)]
*  unique challenges and threats to our ability to continue to lead this rules-based order [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=95.54s)]
*  that's been in place since World War II. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=101.64s)]
*  Well, he has called them pacing challenge, competitor, things along those lines. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=103.18s)]
*  The way he laid it out on Thursday night was stronger than that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  So does he see these three countries as enemies to the United States at this point? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=112.58s)]
*  He sees each of them in their own way. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=118.8s)]
*  And again, I would make sure we include Iran in there as well. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=120.86s)]
*  Each of them as Iran, Russia, and China. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=124.82000000000001s)]
*  Iran, Russia, China, North Korea. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=127.42s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=129.06s)]
*  I thought, but there's really four nation-states that present very unique challenges to not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=130.06s)]
*  only American leadership on the world stage, but to prosperity and stability and security [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=135.66s)]
*  all around the world. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=140.82s)]
*  And each of them present their own unique sort of sets of threats. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=142.06s)]
*  For instance, Russia obviously is a power on the decline, but no less dangerous. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=145.74s)]
*  They don't have the capacity necessarily to change this rules-based order. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=150.9s)]
*  China, on the other hand, is a power very much on the rise and does have the capacity [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=154.74s)]
*  and capability to challenge that rules-based order. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  So you have to take each one sort of separately. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=162.34s)]
*  But that doesn't mean that, as he said, it doesn't mean that we're not obviously concerned [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=165.8s)]
*  about what their capabilities are. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=169.66s)]
*  It sounded like he was looking at them more in a stronger way than he has characterized [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=170.66s)]
*  them in the past on Thursday night, given everything that has happened. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=174.5s)]
*  You were just asked in the briefing about this confrontation between two ships, a Chinese [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=177.9s)]
*  ship and a Philippine ship. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=184.74s)]
*  We have video of this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=186.3s)]
*  You weren't aware that this had happened at the time, but there's video of it that we're [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=188.02s)]
*  showing right now. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=191.66s)]
*  A dangerous situation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=194.26s)]
*  We've seen these similar situations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=195.98000000000002s)]
*  What is your take on this, John, between these two countries? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=197.86s)]
*  Yeah, look, as a former naval officer, it's obviously alarming when you see this kind [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=200.1s)]
*  of interaction. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=205.14000000000001s)]
*  And you're right, when the briefing came, I had not been aware of it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=206.14000000000001s)]
*  But clearly, this is of a piece of the intimidating, coercive, aggressive behavior by the PLA Navy [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  as well as their so-called Coast Guard in the South China Sea and areas like that to [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=215.66s)]
*  try to bully neighboring states and to try to enforce completely false maritime claims. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=220.58s)]
*  And it's unacceptable. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=226.82000000000002s)]
*  Do you think they're ratcheting it up because obviously everybody's pretty busy with what's [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=227.82000000000002s)]
*  going on in the Middle East now and in the Ukraine? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=231.62s)]
*  Difficult to say with this one incident, Martha, that we're, you know, it's the start of some [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  sort of new trend. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  I think it's been obvious that they have over recent years, even before this administration [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=239.62s)]
*  took office, they'd been increasing their bellicose and intimidating coercive behavior [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=244.9s)]
*  in the South China Sea. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=249.54000000000002s)]
*  It goes to that issue of these three countries that are all quite bellicose at the moment [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=250.7s)]
*  around the world. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=254.82s)]
*  This is a scoop that Axios had on Thursday, and it goes to the issue of how many of these [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=256.5s)]
*  confrontations around the world the United States can be in the lead on. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=262.38s)]
*  We're in the lead in Ukraine in terms of supplying them what they need, now in the lead in Israel [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=266.34s)]
*  as well in terms of supplying them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=271.06s)]
*  And Axios reported the Pentagon plans to send Israel tens of thousands of 155-millimeter [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=273.42s)]
*  artillery shells that had been destined for Ukraine from U.S. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=278.78s)]
*  emergency stocks. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=282.62s)]
*  Three Israeli officials with knowledge of the situation told Axios. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=283.82s)]
*  So we're now pulling from one group that we're supporting in order to supply another. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=287.34s)]
*  That doesn't sound like we can do all this at once, John. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, without speaking to the specific stocks from which all these munitions are coming [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=296.98s)]
*  from, I think we're going to be careful on that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=300.7s)]
*  I would make two points. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=302.26s)]
*  One, with every security assistance package we provide, whether it's Ukraine or Israel, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=303.26s)]
*  we also do an assessment of our own national security and make sure that we have enough [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=308.38s)]
*  for our own war plans, for our own operational needs, and that process continues. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=311.74s)]
*  But two, make no mistake, we have given a lot off the shelf to Ukraine, certainly over [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=315.98s)]
*  the last 18 months and now heading in here with Israel, which is why in the supplemental [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=321.18s)]
*  request that the president submitted last week on Friday, there's a significant chunk [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=325.98s)]
*  dedicated specifically to replenishment of DOD stockpiles. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=330.14s)]
*  We absolutely need that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  We need Congress to support us in that regard. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=335.62s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=338.46s)]
*  You know, it's a lot of people are looking at what's going on in the Middle East right [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=339.74s)]
*  now and thinking about these hostages, American hostages and Israeli hostages. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=343.85999999999996s)]
*  And it harkens back to something that we saw in 1979, which is disturbing to remember. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  And it raises the question of whether or not we're going to see, God forbid, John, see [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=356.53999999999996s)]
*  scenes like this again. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=362.14s)]
*  How many U.S. hostages does Hamas have right now? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=364.42s)]
*  How many Americans are they holding? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=371.22s)]
*  I want to be careful with an exact number because we still have 10 unaccounted for [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=373.7s)]
*  Americans and we don't know where they are. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=377.46000000000004s)]
*  It's possible that some of them or all of them could be in the hostage pool. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=379.86s)]
*  But right now, Martha, I would say it's about it's a handful. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=384.5s)]
*  And I know that's not a satisfactory number for you, but it's really as specific as I [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=388.5s)]
*  can be. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=393.14s)]
*  It's not it's not terribly a lot. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=393.53999999999996s)]
*  But of course, every single life matters to President Biden. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=395.94s)]
*  We want to get every single one of them home. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=398.82s)]
*  We just don't know of the 10 unaccounted for Americans if some of them may also be in [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=400.9s)]
*  the hostage pool. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=405.94s)]
*  You don't have confirmation that they are dead. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=406.5s)]
*  Do you have proof of life confirmation on these 10 people? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=409.21999999999997s)]
*  Have you seen images that they're being held? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=412.9s)]
*  What is where are we with this? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=415.78s)]
*  No, no, no, Martha. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=417.62s)]
*  Believe me, if we had proof of life, we wouldn't count them in the 10. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=419.06s)]
*  There are 10 unaccounted for Americans. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=422.02s)]
*  We don't know whether they're missing and just lost or in a hospital somewhere, whether [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=424.34s)]
*  they are deceased or whether they are being held hostage. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=428.02s)]
*  And we're trying very hard to get more information about all 10 of them. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=431.06s)]
*  It's a concern to us as well as to their families. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=435.14s)]
*  But the truth is the honest truth is that we don't have perfect information on these [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=437.62s)]
*  10. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=441.21999999999997s)]
*  So do you I mean, do you anticipate a situation where we see these people paraded, blindfolded, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=441.62s)]
*  the kind of, you know, I mean, obviously they just released two [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  older women, right? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=451.94s)]
*  They still have a lot of people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  So if they sort of, you know, lighten up on how many people they have to manage, clearly [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=456.74s)]
*  they still have a lot of leverage. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=463.38s)]
*  Is this why there's a delay in the ground invasion? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=464.66s)]
*  And is the United States insisting that that not happen until we get our people home? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=469.3s)]
*  And also, what about the 32 Americans? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=475.54s)]
*  Are their bodies going to be sent home? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=477.94s)]
*  What's happening with that? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=480.18s)]
*  Well, there's a lot there. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=481.62s)]
*  Let me start with the hostage situation and this ground incursion. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=482.9s)]
*  As you know, and we've talked about Martha, we're not dictating terms to the Israeli Defense [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=486.65999999999997s)]
*  Forces. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=491.3s)]
*  They should speak to their operations both present and future. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=491.94s)]
*  I won't do that. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=494.5s)]
*  We have talked from the very beginning with our Israeli counterparts about thinking through [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=495.94s)]
*  the ramifications of their operations, making sure that they're asking themselves the same [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=501.21999999999997s)]
*  kind of questions we ask ourselves when we conduct operations about what the second and [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=505.7s)]
*  third order effects might be, what the unintended consequences might be, certainly what effect [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=509.86s)]
*  there might be on the hostages. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  And you're right, Martha, there are dozens of hostages, not just Americans, but from [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=516.1s)]
*  other countries in Israel as well. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=520.26s)]
*  And certainly we're all concerned about their fate. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=522.34s)]
*  I can't speak for what Hamas might or might not do. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=524.74s)]
*  I can only say that they ought to release every single one of them today. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=527.62s)]
*  Just no bones about it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=531.3000000000001s)]
*  Just let them go. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=532.98s)]
*  They have no business holding these people. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=533.94s)]
*  Short of that, we're going to work with our partners in the region, as we did on Friday [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=535.94s)]
*  to get that mother and daughter out. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=539.86s)]
*  We're going to continue to work with our partners to see what we can to get the rest of them [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=541.86s)]
*  out. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=545.0600000000001s)]
*  Every single life, every single one of them is important to President Biden. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=545.7s)]
*  Have you heard about any arrangement that is in the works for 50 dual nationals, dual [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=547.78s)]
*  citizens? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=553.3000000000001s)]
*  I've seen that press reporting, Martha, but before coming out here to talk to you, I asked [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=554.34s)]
*  to make sure that I had the latest information and we can't confirm the validity of those [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=558.74s)]
*  reports or that offer. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=563.62s)]
*  And I think, you know, I don't have to tell you this, but we've got to take everything [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=565.14s)]
*  Hamas says with a huge grain of salt when it can't take it at face value. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=568.34s)]
*  OK, I understand you were just meeting with the vice president. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=571.54s)]
*  What's her priority? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=575.54s)]
*  What is she speaking about in terms of how she wants to see us handle this situation [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=576.98s)]
*  that is very sensitive in terms of the Palestinians and the Israelis? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=583.78s)]
*  What is she saying about that today? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=588.66s)]
*  She she completely shares President Biden view that we've got to make sure that Israel [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=590.42s)]
*  has the tools, the capabilities to go after these Hamas terrorists, that they know they [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=595.46s)]
*  have our support and they're going to continue to get security assistance, which they will. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=599.46s)]
*  She also believes strongly that it's important that we keep that humanitarian aid going into [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=603.22s)]
*  the people of Gaza. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=607.62s)]
*  You know, another 20 trucks made it in today, Martha. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=608.5s)]
*  We're hoping that that can continue. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=610.98s)]
*  It's a it's not enough. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=612.34s)]
*  I understand that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=614.18s)]
*  We all understand that. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=614.98s)]
*  The vice president understands that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=615.78s)]
*  But we got to keep that flowing. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=617.14s)]
*  And then, of course, she equally shares our concerns about these hostages, all of them, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=618.58s)]
*  but particularly the Americans that we know that Hamas is holding and making sure that [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=623.3000000000001s)]
*  we're working with might and main to get them out, get them back with their families. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=626.9000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's incredible how many of these hostages are being held very quickly. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=630.0200000000001s)]
*  It's in my understanding that the that the Houthis attacks on Yemen, that our folks were, [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=634.82s)]
*  you know, sort of battling that situation for nine hours. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=642.26s)]
*  There have also been nine attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=645.5400000000001s)]
*  All of this is happening by Iranian proxies. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=649.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, as the United States kind of respond to either one of these situations, John. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=653.3000000000001s)]
*  I'll tell you what, Martha, we're going to do what we need to do to protect and defend [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=657.62s)]
*  our forces, make sure that they they have the force protection measures in place to [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=660.6600000000001s)]
*  protect themselves. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=664.02s)]
*  We absolutely acknowledge, and I said it at the briefing, that these groups are supported [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=665.3000000000001s)]
*  by Iran. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=669.46s)]
*  There's no question about that and that we're going to do what we have to do to protect [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=670.02s)]
*  ourselves. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=673.5400000000001s)]
*  Now, as for a response, obviously, I won't telegraph any punches that might or might [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=673.86s)]
*  not be coming, just that as we've done before, if there's going to be a response, it's going [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=677.86s)]
*  to be at a time and a manner of our choosing. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=681.86s)]
*  We're going to do what we have to do to protect our interests. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=683.78s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why the president directed more military capabilities into the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=685.7s)]
*  region. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=690.42s)]
*  Two strike groups, one of them going to the Middle East and one of them staying in the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=691.0600000000001s)]
*  Eastern Med, as well as additional air defense systems that the secretary of defense deployed [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=694.1800000000001s)]
*  or ordered to be deployed just over the weekend. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=698.26s)]
*  Well, a lot on the plate at the White House, to be sure. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=700.58s)]
*  John Kirby, thanks for taking some time to speak with us today. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=703.5400000000001s)]
*  We always appreciate it. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyZiD5fRI4w&t=706.34s)]
