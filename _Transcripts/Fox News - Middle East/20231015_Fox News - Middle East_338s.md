# Hamas: Multiple hostages killed by Israeli strikes
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw)
*  You're looking live in Gaza this morning as the ground offensive there for Israel, their [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=0.0s)]
*  plans continue to move forward. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=9.28s)]
*  They're pushing for more calls for more than a million residents to evacuate from northern [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=11.68s)]
*  Gaza, wanting them to head south as they renew their vow to counter the Hamas attacks with [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=16.04s)]
*  even greater force. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=19.76s)]
*  Troops remain masked on the Gaza border as Israel's ground invasion again appears imminent. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=21.68s)]
*  Joining me now, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner, a spokesperson for the Israel Defense [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=25.76s)]
*  Forces. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=29.6s)]
*  Colonel, we appreciate your time this morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=30.6s)]
*  Thank you for making time for us. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  I want to read something from the president that he has put out on social media, our President [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  Biden. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=38.040000000000006s)]
*  He says, we must not lose sight of the fact that the overwhelming majority of Palestinians [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=39.040000000000006s)]
*  had nothing to do with Hamas' appalling attacks and are suffering as a result of them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=42.72s)]
*  How are you all managing? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=48.6s)]
*  You've made very clear calls for people to leave, to move away from potential hot spots [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=50.160000000000004s)]
*  and targets. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=54.76s)]
*  How are you managing all of that with plans for your further ground offensive? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=55.92s)]
*  Good morning, Shannon. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=59.96s)]
*  Indeed, the idea is on operations are ongoing and part of those operations are our call [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=62.24s)]
*  for people to evacuate from the north of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=68.52s)]
*  It's a measure in order to safeguard human life. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=72.12s)]
*  And we are seeing a huge movement of people from north to south. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=76.24s)]
*  Despite the fact that Hamas tried to prevent it, both physically and in messages. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=81.44s)]
*  So the operations are actually targeted, as we can see over the last nine days now. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  We're in the midst of day nine here in Israel since the October 7th massacre in destroying [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=94.56s)]
*  Hamas' capability to ever use the Gaza Strip as a staging ground against us. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=102.24s)]
*  We are targeting their leaders. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=107.56s)]
*  We are targeting their terrorists. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=109.0s)]
*  And yes, we are determined to defeat them. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=110.55999999999999s)]
*  And I would say we didn't ask for this war, but we are going to win it. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=113.44s)]
*  What about the issue, the ongoing issue of hostages who are being held in some of these [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=118.36s)]
*  areas? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  You know, Hamas makes reports that we can in any way verify or trust. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  It's just coming from them that there are hostages being killed by the Israeli airstrikes [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=127.52s)]
*  and other incursions. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=131.64s)]
*  Can you tell us anything about efforts to make sure those people are returned home? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=133.64s)]
*  Well, yeah, I agree. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  We would need to be very, very cautious in listening to anything an organization that [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=140.84s)]
*  is willing to butcher babies in their bedrooms has to say. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=146.28s)]
*  Of course, it's an emotional manipulation to try to exert more pressure on Israel as [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=150.16s)]
*  we mount up the pressure on them. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  The 120 or so hostages need to be taken care of by Hamas. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=160.68s)]
*  They are responsible for their well-being. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=167.92s)]
*  They need to release them immediately. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  And while I would like to delve into more details, it's obvious it is a very sensitive [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=171.96s)]
*  issue and we need to respect the efforts that are ongoing in order to try and bring them [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=176.84s)]
*  home. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=182.88s)]
*  So I guess while I know there's a lot of curiosity about what is actually going on, I think we [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=183.88s)]
*  need to leave it there and leave this type of discussion for those that are trying to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=187.88s)]
*  working to bring them home. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=192.4s)]
*  Archie Yanks, who is there reporting in southern Israel today, showed us a video of the Israeli [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=194.35999999999999s)]
*  military in the Middle East. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=197.8s)]
*  I noticed that it was stormy in many areas and talked about the worries about how that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=198.8s)]
*  may impact plans and operations. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=201.68s)]
*  Has that been a complication for you today or would you say plans are proceeding as you [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=204.36s)]
*  have planned them to be? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=209.28s)]
*  Yeah, the operation is ongoing. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  We are destroying Hamas's capabilities. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  And I would say we're also focusing on the special forces of Hamas, the Nukhba force. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=218.16000000000003s)]
*  Just last night we were able to identify and target and kill Bilal al-Qidra, who was [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=224.2s)]
*  the commander of the Khanunis special forces, the commander unit of Hamas down south, who [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=230.04s)]
*  was actually responsible and participated in infiltrating and penetrating the Nireem [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=237.48s)]
*  kibbutz. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  So we're dealing strikes directly against those that were involved, but also against [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=244.39999999999998s)]
*  the entire institution of Hamas that has been utilized and abused from Yechia Sinwar, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=250.76s)]
*  who is the mastermind of the massacre, the prime minister of Hamas, and he has subordinated [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=257.08s)]
*  the entire institutions of the government of Gaza to serve terrorism. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=262.4s)]
*  So we are striking on all across the spectrum of the institutions of Hamas, from the individuals, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=267.8s)]
*  from their terrorist activities. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=274.88s)]
*  We targeted drones that had explosive devices that were set up on the rooftops of houses. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=276.64s)]
*  Who does that if they're not willing or interested in sacrificing the people that are actually [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=283.08s)]
*  living in those houses? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=287.26s)]
*  So yeah, the mission is ongoing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=288.74s)]
*  I would say that when we're looking forward now, we are amassing a huge amount of force [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  on the battleground in the surrounding areas of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=294.84s)]
*  They are combined forces, special forces, infantry, artillery, the tanks, all different [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=298.88s)]
*  types of units that are preparing for a ground mobilization if the government so instructs. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=307.84s)]
*  And we need to be prepared for that eventuality. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=315.36s)]
*  We know how to operate in all types of weather and conditions, and we will continue until [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=317.64s)]
*  Hamas is defeated. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, Colonel, we know that your prime minister has warned the people, as you all have, that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=323.88s)]
*  this may be a long and difficult fight. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=327.6s)]
*  So thank you for making time for us in the midst of that, Colonel. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=330.76000000000005s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=333.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=334.04s)]
*  Good morning, Shannon. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sN9rSyHWeGw&t=335.04s)]
