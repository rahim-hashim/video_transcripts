*  Always to make sure that they are in disarray that they have a hard time carrying out operations [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=92.44s)]
*  Obviously if you don't keep pushing all the time it might change they might regroup they might rearrange, but we're pushing all the time [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=97.36s)]
*  We're hunting down their commanders [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=103.52s)]
*  We're hunting down their missile launchers making sure they don't have a second to regroup and kind of rearrange their operations [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=105.0s)]
*  And Iran's foreign minister Abbas a rag she says [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=112.56s)]
*  The regime will not return to the negotiating table as long as Israeli strikes are going into Iran guys back to you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=116.32s)]
*  And no indication Mike that's gonna stop anytime soon [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=123.36s)]
*  It seems Israel is continuing to pretty much have a full-court press if you will [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=127.12s)]
*  Right they have freedom of the skies over Iran having decimated their air defenses and again updating what we talked about [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=134.16s)]
*  But just at the top of my life shot here [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=140.8s)]
*  Israeli warplanes are active as we speak over southwest Iran [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=143.76s)]
*  Mike when we talk about Iran's air defenses going into this operation [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  There was a little bit of ambiguity over what air assets Iran may have if they had some fighter jets even some old American ones [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=153.5s)]
*  Is there no Air Force for Iran at this point? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=160.6s)]
*  It doesn't seem they got many aircraft off the ground at all if they had any they had things like [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=165.2s)]
*  Old US F-14s they had purchased 79 of them before the Islamic Revolution [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  They wanted to get 80 but the revolution happened. I remember about a decade ago [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=176.2s)]
*  Speaking with an Israeli F-16 I pilot he said please put one of those things in the air against me [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=180.72s)]
*  14 as much as they're a part of US history [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=187.04s)]
*  They're antiquated compared to the things that the Israeli Air Force has now [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=190.52s)]
*  Yeah, they peaked at talking my question about the American citizens there and especially outside of Tel Aviv my girlfriend's parents for example in Jerusalem [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=193.88s)]
*  They got separated the dad actually was on vacation or visiting the children elsewhere [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=203.04s)]
*  And now the mom's gonna get on a 16-hour bus ride to Egypt to get out talk to us about the tenor there with the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=207.24s)]
*  Americans and whether indeed they are staying put or want to come back [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=211.7s)]
*  Well, you do have a lot of Israelis anyway who are very interested in being here [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=217.24s)]
*  You have a lot of Israelis who are trying to get back into the country just to show solidarity [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=221.16s)]
*  But you do have some of the American Jews who are here and they're nervous about traveling through [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=225.12s)]
*  Arab nations going out through we came in through Jordan a lot of them are nervous about going out through Jordan. They're nervous about going down [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=230.12s)]
*  To the through the south of Israel through the Sinai Peninsula and through Egypt, but people have done it [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=238.88s)]
*  They can make that trip. They've got options. You've also got some [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OUfBftel_JE&t=244.56s)]
