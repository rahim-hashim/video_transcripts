# Several Iranian-linked fighters dead after U.S. issues retaliatory strikes in Syria
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0)
*  A Fox News alert. We are told at least six Iranian fighters are dead after the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=0.0s)]
*  strikes two targets in eastern Syria overnight. One was a training site that doubled as a [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=5.0s)]
*  logistics and weapons storage facility. The other, a safe house. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=10.0s)]
*  You're watching Fox & Friends first here on a Monday morning. I'm Todd Pyron. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=14.0s)]
*  And I'm Carly Schimkes. These precision airstrikes were in retaliation for the 48 attacks [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=17.0s)]
*  on our troops in Iraq and Syria since October 17th. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=22.0s)]
*  And our Defense Secretary says more could come if the violence doesn't stop. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=26.0s)]
*  We're also seeing new video of the moment Israel's Arrow Interceptor successfully [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=30.0s)]
*  shot down a rocket launched from Iranian-backed fighters in Yemen on October 31st. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=35.0s)]
*  Just look at that video. And it is still a very active war scene over in Gaza and Israel today. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=40.0s)]
*  That's right. Trey Yanks is reporting live on the ground in southern Israel for us this morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=60.0s)]
*  Hi Trey. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=64.0s)]
*  Hey Todd, Carly. Good morning. It is day 38 of the war between Israel and Hamas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=67.0s)]
*  Overnight the Israelis ramped up their airstrikes against the northern and central part of Gaza. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=72.0s)]
*  Into today they're still striking the northern part of the Strip. You can see here, as my [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=77.0s)]
*  cameraman pushes in, some of that black smoke rising from the Gaza skyline. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=81.0s)]
*  The Israelis working to support those infantry troops that are pushing deeper into Gaza. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=85.0s)]
*  The Palestinians reported those new airstrikes in the second largest city of Khan Yunis overnight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=89.0s)]
*  On the ground we do understand that the Israelis have the Al-Shifa Hospital surrounded. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=94.0s)]
*  They say they are still trying to get people to evacuate from the eastern side of that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=99.0s)]
*  hospital, but it comes as they are trying to take more territory across Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=103.0s)]
*  The Israelis say they now control the Gaza port with the help of their navy and the death toll [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=107.0s)]
*  among Israeli forces rising to 44 soldiers since the ground operation began. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=111.0s)]
*  I do want to draw your attention though to northern Israel along the border with Lebanon where [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=116.0s)]
*  fighting is intensifying. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah getting more directly involved [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=120.0s)]
*  in this fight. They are trying to see just how far they can go, pushing their luck with [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=125.0s)]
*  the Israelis according to officials that we've talked to because they are using anti-tank [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=130.0s)]
*  guided missiles. They are also trying to fire mortars into northern Israel and this has [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=135.0s)]
*  led to more than two dozen injuries over the past two days between the soldiers and the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=140.0s)]
*  civilians in the northern part of Israel. A very active scene on the southern front and on the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=146.0s)]
*  northern front as the fighting continues between Israel and Hamas and Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=151.0s)]
*  Todd, Carly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=156.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us this morning. Trey, thank you for starting us off. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=158.0s)]
*  Let's bring in Fox News contributor and former CIA station chief Dan Hoffman. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=161.0s)]
*  Dan, the breaking news, that strike from the good guys against the bad guys, the United [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=165.0s)]
*  States troops against Iran proxies. Is this strike going to be the one that finally [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=169.0s)]
*  deters Iran? Or, Dan, is it too little too late still? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=174.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's certainly a question that President Biden's national security [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=179.0s)]
*  advisors will be asking the intelligence community and our Department of Defense. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=184.0s)]
*  We've been, I think the Biden administration's been very careful about walking up that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=189.0s)]
*  escalation ladder step by step and these latest strikes, which reportedly killed, as you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=194.0s)]
*  said, six Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps militants. So not Guard Corps themselves, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=200.0s)]
*  but proxy militants associated with them. That's another step. I don't think it will be [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=206.0s)]
*  enough to deter Iran. I think Iran sees great value in stretching U.S. forces. Look, we've [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=212.0s)]
*  deployed two carrier groups, Patriot missiles and aircraft to the region, and that's exactly [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=218.0s)]
*  what Iran wants, as well as their allies, Russia and China. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=223.0s)]
*  Yeah, and over the weekend, Dan, Iran's president visited Saudi Arabia for the first [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=227.0s)]
*  time in over a decade for this summit, where Arab and Muslim leaders openly condemned [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=232.0s)]
*  Israel's war in the Gaza Strip. What do you think about that? And also at this summit, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=237.0s)]
*  there was open criticism for Arab nations to have normalized relations with Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=242.0s)]
*  So is there any hope left that Saudi Arabia will one day normalize relations with Israel? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=248.0s)]
*  Well, I think there's two wars going on simultaneously. One is the kinetic war you've [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=255.0s)]
*  been reporting on so well, Trey, including Trey, this morning from Gaza. The other one [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=259.0s)]
*  is the information war, and we're not winning that one. You know, the—Pamas is deliberately [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=264.0s)]
*  using their brethren as human shields to create a humanitarian catastrophe in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=270.0s)]
*  And Iran knows that they can drive a wedge between pro-Palestinian populations in Egypt [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=276.0s)]
*  and Saudi Arabia and Jordan and the rulers of those nations. And Iran, as you rightly [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=282.0s)]
*  point out, particularly focused on Saudi Arabia, they want to ensure that there is no reconciliation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=287.0s)]
*  between Israel and Saudi Arabia, and this is their opportunity to try to pressure the [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=292.0s)]
*  government of Saudi Arabia to hold off on what would have been a great diplomatic achievement [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=297.0s)]
*  on top of the Abraham Accords. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=301.0s)]
*  Focusing on the kinetic for a moment, these were precision strikes, and that makes me [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=303.0s)]
*  beg the question, look, we've got some of the best surveillance technology in the world, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=308.0s)]
*  if not the best. We have individuals like yourself, the highest level of our intel apparatus [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=313.0s)]
*  that knows where the bad guys are. I keep using that phrase, bad guys. So why don't we do [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=319.0s)]
*  more of these surgical strikes that basically keep our men and women out of combat but accomplish [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=324.0s)]
*  many of the same goals? Dan, why don't we do more of this? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=330.0s)]
*  Well, I think we're doing it. Look, the Iranians are pretty good with their proxy militants [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=335.0s)]
*  at moving from place to place. They construct these safe houses that they use for mobile [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=340.0s)]
*  headquarters for some period of time, and then they'll move on from there. I think we're still [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=346.0s)]
*  waiting for the battle damage assessment for these latest strikes. But again, I think what the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=351.0s)]
*  Biden administration does and what administrations have done before them is, frankly, not enough [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=355.0s)]
*  to deter Iran. I can remember when I was serving in Iraq over a decade ago, and we were subjected [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=360.0s)]
*  to daily strikes from Iranian proxy militias there, and we never did enough to stop them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=366.0s)]
*  The Iranians use these proxy militias, and it's a challenge for us to devote our intelligence [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=371.0s)]
*  resources to find and fix and then finish those locations. Yeah, and there's also this Wall [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=377.0s)]
*  Street Journal op-ed titled, Biden Keeps the Billions Flowing to Iran, and it points out [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=381.0s)]
*  Iran exported nearly 1.4 million barrels of oil per day last month, which is up 80% from when Trump [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=386.0s)]
*  had the maximum pressure strategy on Iran. So they say that Iran has made an additional 32 to [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=394.0s)]
*  $35 billion since Joe Biden took office. So there are these military efforts, but they also say [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=400.0s)]
*  follow the money, and there's a lot of money still flowing to Iran because of this oil. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=406.0s)]
*  Right, and that's the larger strategic issue at play here. Iran is now a nuclear threshold state, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=412.0s)]
*  and yeah, the oil is flowing, so that might keep oil prices down, and maybe the Biden [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=416.0s)]
*  administration wants that, but it adds money to Iran's coffers, and they're allowed to divert [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=421.0s)]
*  that money, to support these proxy terrorists like Hezbollah and the Houthis, as well as their [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=427.0s)]
*  militants in Iraq and in Syria. And at this time, in particular, the Iranians are not [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=433.0s)]
*  only a threat to the country, but they're also a threat to the world. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRKYxQt7Lz0&t=439.0s)]
