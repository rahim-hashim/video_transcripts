# Trey Yingst: Israeli official visited Doha to discuss hostage negotiations
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g)
*  to a Fox News alert. The Saudi Minister of Defense, who is MBS's brother actually, is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=0.0s)]
*  set to visit the White House today and will be meeting with senior Biden administration [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=7.72s)]
*  officials to discuss the war in Israel. All right, here this comes on the heels of President [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Biden, holding an emergency phone call with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, urging [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=17.6s)]
*  him to protect innocent Palestinian civilians in Gaza, allow them to access to humanitarian [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=21.72s)]
*  aid. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=27.36s)]
*  Breaking right now, airstrikes continue along the Israel-Gaza border. You can see them right [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=29.9s)]
*  there. Look at all that smoke. As Fox News learns, officials from the Jewish state met [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=34.54s)]
*  with Qatari negotiators over the weekend to discuss releasing the 239 people being held [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=38.78s)]
*  hostage. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=44.82s)]
*  Trey Yanks joins us live on the ground in southern Israel. What's the latest on the [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=45.82s)]
*  ground invasion, Trey? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=48.78s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. We do have some new information for you breaking right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  Fox News has learned that a high-level Israeli official in coordination with the United States [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=57.5s)]
*  visited Doha on Saturday to meet with Qatari negotiators. The discussion focused around [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=63.14s)]
*  the hostages and how to further those talks to get more hostages released. That information [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=68.82s)]
*  from an official who was briefed on the visit. We're also learning more about how the escalation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=73.96s)]
*  on Friday night began. This source telling Fox that talks had stalled on Friday due to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=79.08s)]
*  disagreements on the technical aspects of a potential deal. The talks did continue on [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=84.18s)]
*  Saturday and were described by this source as productive. All of this comes as Israeli [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=89.42s)]
*  forces are now operating in the Gaza Strip behind me. I want to show you what it was [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  like just two hours ago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=98.34s)]
*  You can see right here Israeli troops operating inside the Gaza Strip. What you're looking [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=101.86000000000001s)]
*  at is a tank on the edge of Gaza. The Israelis telling Fox News today that they are ramping [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=106.94000000000001s)]
*  up their efforts, sending more infantry troops into the Strip. The level of destruction is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=113.5s)]
*  significant. Over the past 24 hours, Israel hit more than 600 targets inside Gaza. We [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=119.1s)]
*  can hear fighter jets overhead and the artillery units working in the distance as day 24 of [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=126.86s)]
*  the war unfolds. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=132.74s)]
*  Even as we speak, the Israelis are launching illuminator rounds into Gaza, marking their [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=136.66s)]
*  next targets. We have some video of those forces operating on both the western and eastern [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=140.76s)]
*  side of Gaza. We were just on a hilltop looking into Gaza and you can see plumes of smoke [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=145.95999999999998s)]
*  rising up from many different locations. The spokesman for the Israeli military, Daniel [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=151.0s)]
*  Hagari, talking today about the situation. Take a listen. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  Over the past day, we have expanded ground activities with additional forces entering [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=161.0s)]
*  the Gaza Strip, including infantry, armored corps, combat engineering and artillery corps. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=164.78s)]
*  Through integrated strikes of the ground forces and the IAF, dozens of terrorists were [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=169.92s)]
*  eliminated last night who had barricaded themselves in buildings and attempted to attack the forces [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=173.72s)]
*  that were moving in their direction. I want to explain and provide an example. We are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=178.6s)]
*  conducting expanded ground operations in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=182.42s)]
*  You can see the aftermath of Israeli strikes here inside Gaza, complete blocks leveled [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=188.32s)]
*  and reduced to rubble. I've been talking with Palestinian civilians in the Strip today. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=193.11999999999998s)]
*  They say the Israelis have destroyed the two main access roads to the northern part [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=197.52s)]
*  of Gaza, effectively cutting off the south from the north as those infantry troops continue [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  to push deeper into the Strip. We expect these activities to continue throughout the day, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  the roar of fighter jets overhead as the Israelis target other positions inside. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=212.56s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=217.24s)]
*  So Trey, the unrest within, the political unrest with Benjamin Netanyahu offering an [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=220.72s)]
*  apology after a tweet that really alleviated himself from any blame on October 7th and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  him coming and apologizing later. How much is this unrest and Benjamin Netanyahu not [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=231.16s)]
*  really doing much outside that speech the other day playing into how this invasion is [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  prosecuted? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=243.67999999999998s)]
*  I would point to the remarks that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made when [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  he was joined by his war cabinet and his defense minister, Yav Galan, the other night [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=251.4s)]
*  as they were talking about the situation on the ground and the decision to enter the next [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=255.84s)]
*  phase of this war. Netanyahu that night said that questions will need answers and not just [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=260.12s)]
*  from his cabinet and from the intelligence heads here in Israel, but also from himself. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  And there is a lot of frustration. Questions remain in Israel about how the security breach [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=271.56s)]
*  could take place. The Gaza border was touted by the Israelis as the most advanced and most [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=276.88s)]
*  secure border in the world. And yet Hamas was still able to infiltrate into southern [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=282.4s)]
*  Israel and commit that massacre, slaughtering more than 1,400 people. So the questions remain, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  but the focus now for Israeli officials is the conflict raging on behind me and ensuring [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=292.04s)]
*  that it doesn't unravel to the rest of the region. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=296.56s)]
*  Alright, Trey, thank you so much. Be safe out there. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq1YKK4rO4g&t=298.76s)]
