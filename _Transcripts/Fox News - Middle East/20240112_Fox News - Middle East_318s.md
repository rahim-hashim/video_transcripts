# Intel warns of possible Hezbollah attacks on US soil: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s)
*  Bring in Jim Hansen, who is chief editor of Middle East Forum and served in the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=0.0s)]
*  Army Special Forces. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=4.36s)]
*  Jim, great to have you here this morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=5.36s)]
*  Some ask, where was this strike weeks ago? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=7.8s)]
*  Others say this increases the chances of the United States being dragged into a larger [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=10.6s)]
*  conflict. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=15.64s)]
*  Where do you lie, Jim? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=16.64s)]
*  Both of those things are true, but this was a vital and necessary step. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=18.96s)]
*  And I'm glad we actually involved our allies from the U.K. and others in this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=22.96s)]
*  Freedom of navigation and protection of global trade is one of the main functions of the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  U.S. Navy. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=33.08s)]
*  So I think we needed to do it. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=34.36s)]
*  I don't think we should lose sight of the fact that this is theâ€”the Houthis are basically [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=35.92s)]
*  a franchise terror operation of the Iranian regime. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=40.2s)]
*  They're 100 percent owned and operated by them, as are the militias who've been attacking [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  us in Iraq and Syria, as are Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=48.1s)]
*  So at some point, we're going to have to deal with the spider at the center of this [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=51.7s)]
*  web. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=55.28s)]
*  That's the real danger. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=56.28s)]
*  OK, so a senior White House administration official says, while we fully expect this [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  action to diminish the Houthis' capabilities, we would not be surprised to see some sort [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=63.32s)]
*  of response. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=68.88s)]
*  So, what do you think about that? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=69.88s)]
*  What can we expect realistically to happen next? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=72.0s)]
*  I don't think there's any chance the Houthis and the other Iranian proxies are going to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=75.4s)]
*  lower their operations just because we took this first attack. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=83.12s)]
*  I think it's necessary, and I think it was good, and I think we damaged some of their [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  abilities to do it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  They'll be back again, and we need to be ready. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=91.72s)]
*  We also need to be prepared for an escalation from Iran in other areas. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=94.28s)]
*  They may tell Hezbollah and other actors to turn up the heat on either Israel or potentially [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=98.56s)]
*  U.S. targets around the world. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=104.88s)]
*  Jim, this launch presumably was orchestrated from a hospital room. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=107.80000000000001s)]
*  Lloyd Austin is not sitting there in the middle of the Pentagon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=113.72000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, we've reported extensively on his health conditions. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=117.44000000000001s)]
*  Can you think of a time in our history where something like that has happened, where somebody [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=121.12s)]
*  has been in sort of an incapacitated capacity and authorized a strike like this? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=127.44000000000001s)]
*  And, comma, what are the ramifications for that going forward? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=132.56s)]
*  I assume Lloyd Austin is cognizant of his duties, except that he forgot them when he [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  failed to inform his chain of command that he was in the intensive care unit. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=144.79999999999998s)]
*  That's dereliction of duty. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=149.84s)]
*  It's a lie of omission. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=151.72s)]
*  And he needs to be fired. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=154.28s)]
*  And if he's not fired, the Republicans in the House ought to start impeachment hearings [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=155.28s)]
*  because he let the entire country down and put us all at risk by refusing to tell even [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=161.28s)]
*  his deputy that he was incapable of doing his job for a number of days early this year. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=167.04s)]
*  OK, so this strike targeted the Houthis in Yemen, but let's talk about another Iranian-backed [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  terror group, and that's Hezbollah out of Lebanon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=177.68s)]
*  A very concerning report at Politico says U.S. officials assess that there is a rising risk. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=180.48s)]
*  Lebanese Hezbollah militants will strike Americans in the Middle East and even potentially hit [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=186.88000000000002s)]
*  inside the United States. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=191.84s)]
*  These officials say the chance for an assault on U.S. soil is growing. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=193.60000000000002s)]
*  These officials declined to give any specifics about the kind of attacks Hezbollah might be [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=197.52s)]
*  considering, but they did say that this particular terror group has capabilities that other terror [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=203.36s)]
*  groups don't. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=208.72000000000003s)]
*  All of this, Jim, made even more concerning when you consider our open southern border. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=209.76000000000002s)]
*  So what do you think about this? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  Anyone of military age who has wanted to walk across our southern border has been able to do [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=217.44s)]
*  so, and the Biden administration, instead of dealing with that as a threat, has welcomed them, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=223.44s)]
*  given them resources and moved them throughout the country. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=229.68s)]
*  So, essentially, we've been bringing everyone in with no idea who they are, and now I'm certain [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=233.12s)]
*  that terror groups, including Hezbollah, have used that to place some of their operatives in the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=240.08s)]
*  United States. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=245.6s)]
*  They've been running crime syndicate-type operations previously in the United States. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=246.64s)]
*  We've caught them doing that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=250.79999999999998s)]
*  So there's no chance that they didn't take advantage of this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=252.24s)]
*  It's a massive failure by the Biden administration, because the United States inside our borders is [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=255.44s)]
*  just one collection of giant soft targets. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=261.44s)]
*  We can't protect all of it, and if they decide to take advantage of it, they can, and American [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=264.48s)]
*  citizens will die. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=269.6s)]
*  Let me just be clear. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=270.96s)]
*  I think last night's strike was important, but that said, did last night's strike against the [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=271.84s)]
*  Houthis increase the chance of the Houthis or Hezbollah, as Carly mentioned, increasing that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=277.6s)]
*  chance of an attack on our homeland, do you think? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=283.44s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=287.68s)]
*  It has increased that possibility, and we need to act accordingly. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=288.64s)]
*  That doesn't mean we should fail to do what we need to do as the only global superpower. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=292.32s)]
*  It's up to us to make sure global trade continues, but we also need to make sure that we're not [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=297.68s)]
*  simply allowing the United States to be infiltrated by anyone with a pair of tennis shoes and a bad [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=303.6s)]
*  attitude. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  It's called walking and chewing gum at the same time, and it has life and death consequences. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=310.24s)]
*  Hopefully this administration can follow through with it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=314.48s)]
*  Jim Hansen, thank you for your time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_6hLvADpz3s&t=316.8s)]
