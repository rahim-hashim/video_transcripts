# 'HUGE PROJECT': Putin says Russia may build more nuclear facilities in Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE)
*  Turning to this now, Vladimir Putin saying that Russia may build more nuclear power facilities in Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=0.0s)]
*  The two countries signing a deal in Moscow today, strengthening what they call their strategic partnership, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=7.0s)]
*  just days before President-elect Trump takes office. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=14.0s)]
*  We have a huge project in nuclear energy. One unit is already operating, operating successfully. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=19.0s)]
*  And we are now discussing the possibility of building additional units. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=26.0s)]
*  All right, let's bring in President-elect Trump's incoming special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=31.0s)]
*  retired Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. General Kellogg, always great to have you with us. Thank you very much. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=36.0s)]
*  Thanks, Martha, for having me on tonight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=43.0s)]
*  So the first thing that occurs to me when I listen to that from Vladimir Putin is that while, you know, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=45.0s)]
*  our allies have all been concerted in the effort to make sure that Iran never becomes a nuclear weapons power. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=52.0s)]
*  And in the process of trying to prevent that, Iran has always said, well, this is just nuclear energy that we're working on. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=60.0s)]
*  These are just, you know, power supply plants that we want to build here in Iran. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=67.0s)]
*  But while all that's been going on, Russia has been building nuclear power plants in Iran and apparently wants to build more. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=72.0s)]
*  Are you OK with that in terms of national security for us? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=81.0s)]
*  No, not really. But look, Martha, when you talk about nuclear and nuclear power plants and developing a nuclear weapon, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=85.0s)]
*  you know, most countries, if they use use nuclear power, they enrich uranium to about three to six percent. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=92.0s)]
*  They're enriching uranium at about 80 percent now. You get to 90 percent enrichment. You're a weapons grade. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=100.0s)]
*  Why are you going to that? And I think the reason they're going to go to it is I think they want to build [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=106.0s)]
*  the desires to build a nuclear weapon which would totally destabilize the Middle East. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=110.0s)]
*  But look, this deal that was made between Putin and Pesachian is kind of interesting because it shows a real weakness on the part of both sides. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=114.0s)]
*  The Iranians know that President Trump is coming back in. They know he is very strong against Iran. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=123.0s)]
*  They know he had a maximum pressure campaign. And the Iranians didn't do real well in their fight against Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=130.0s)]
*  And when you look at the allies they've lost, Hezbollah, Hamas, Assad in Syria, and the fact that the Israelis could penetrate the aerospace [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=135.0s)]
*  with over 150 aircraft and not lose one, they have got a major concern. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=143.0s)]
*  On the other side of that, you look at Russia. Russia's got a concern as well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=148.0s)]
*  They are losing massive amount of soldiers in the fight with Ukraine. It's an asymmetric war. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=152.0s)]
*  They're going to drone warfare and they rely a lot on the Iranians for equipment. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=157.0s)]
*  Now, the pact that they're talking about right now is not the same that the Russians have signed with the North Koreans, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=161.0s)]
*  which is to provide not just weapons but people as well. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=167.0s)]
*  And that's the reason there's between 10,000 and 30,000 North Korean troops fighting right now inside actually Russia and around Kursk. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=170.0s)]
*  The Iranians won't do that. They generally don't put troops outside of Iran. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=178.0s)]
*  But that shows weakness on both parts. And I think part of it, the underlying concern they both have, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=182.0s)]
*  is they are very, very nervous about President Trump coming back into office because they know he brings strength. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=187.0s)]
*  He's very resolute. They know what they've done, especially with Iran when he nearly broke their back with economic sanctions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=194.0s)]
*  They see the same thing coming. So what you've got, you've got this alliance developing dependence on each other [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=200.0s)]
*  because they're afraid of what's coming at them in about three days. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=206.0s)]
*  Yeah, when you see these enemy powers in a weakened position clinging to each other, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=209.0s)]
*  it is a good sign that they're weakened, but also a scary sign of what they might do [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=216.0s)]
*  because they're concerned about maintaining their own power centers. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=223.0s)]
*  I'm curious what you thought when you heard Pesachki and the Iranian president tell Lester Holt on NBC [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=228.0s)]
*  that there was never any effort to assassinate President Trump. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=234.0s)]
*  What did you think about that? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=238.0s)]
*  If you believe that, what Pesachki said and the people in Iran, I've got a bridge near Brooklyn that I'm willing to send you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=240.0s)]
*  I just don't trust what they say. These are the same people that have religiously said, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=248.0s)]
*  death to America, death to Israel. You really can't trust them, and I don't at all. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=253.0s)]
*  The fact is they're just scared because if they said they were going to do it, they know what the consequences are. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=258.0s)]
*  I think they've got major concerns, as they should have, with the new president coming in in three days, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=263.0s)]
*  who's got an incredible track record, not only in the Far East, but in the Middle East as well, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=268.0s)]
*  and they don't know what the consequences are going to be, and they should be concerned about it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=273.0s)]
*  But I think you're absolutely right, by the way, that it should concern us that they're actually developing this true new axis of evil [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=277.0s)]
*  when you've got Iran, you've got China, you've got North Korea and Russia all together. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=283.0s)]
*  But that shows me weakness. It doesn't show me strength. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=287.0s)]
*  So you're the incoming special envoy for Russia and Ukraine, and during the campaign, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=290.0s)]
*  the incoming President Trump told everyone that he could solve the Ukraine war in just a few days. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=295.0s)]
*  So is that going to happen, and what kind of negotiation are we looking at? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=302.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to be solved. I think both sides are, even though the Russians don't really say it, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=307.0s)]
*  I think both sides are wanting to get to some type of resolution. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=312.0s)]
*  You know, when you fight a war for three years, it just does degrade the heck out of you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=315.0s)]
*  And when you look at the troop losses, the equipment losses, and the potential what President Trump can apply, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=319.0s)]
*  be it sanctions or on the oil industry of Russia, they should be concerned about it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=324.0s)]
*  But I think it's something you have to develop with a very comprehensive strategy. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=329.0s)]
*  I think that's coming together right now. President Trump doesn't talk about it. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=332.0s)]
*  I don't know if any of us should talk about it, but I'm very, very confident that within the near term [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=336.0s)]
*  that we're going to have some good results on bringing, finally, some peace to that region between Ukraine and Russia. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=341.0s)]
*  And it's going to affect everybody else around the world as well. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=347.0s)]
*  Yep. Just two seconds. But do you think that Zelensky is open to negotiation? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=350.0s)]
*  And we'll continue to talk about it more next time. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=354.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's ready for it. I think the Russians are too. They're not talking about it. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=358.0s)]
*  But I think both sides want to look at it or looking at the referee to tap out of a cage fight. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=361.0s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg, always good to see you, sir. Thank you very much. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=366.0s)]
*  Thanks, Martha. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJLBKXv1kYE&t=370.0s)]
