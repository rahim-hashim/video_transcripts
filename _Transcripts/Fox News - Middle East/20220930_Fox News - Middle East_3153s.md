# Karine Jean-Pierre holds White House press briefing
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA)
*  Good afternoon everybody. Happy Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, so today was a historic day for the country. We should all be proud of Justice [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=5.0s)]
*  Kintanji Brown Jackson and her historic investiture to the United States Supreme Court. More than [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=12.0s)]
*  100 justices have served on the United States Supreme Court over the past 200 years. But [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=19.0s)]
*  today for the first time Americans and people across the world will see four women sitting [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=25.28s)]
*  on the bench. And today for the first time Americans will see a black woman serving on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  our nation's highest court. This is a proud day for America, for our democracy and in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  particular for women and black women. This fulfills major promises President Biden made [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=41.32s)]
*  to help make sure our Supreme Court bench reflects the diversity of our nation and more [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=47.84s)]
*  broadly to strengthen the judiciary by fighting to nominate and confirm federal judges at [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=53.88s)]
*  a fast rate. He promised his nominees would be experienced, committed to the rule of law, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=59.56s)]
*  and that they would represent diverse personal and professional backgrounds. Since taking [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=64.84s)]
*  office President Biden has made 143 nominations, 84 have been confirmed, which is standout [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  progress. And of his 143 nominees, 68% have been women and 66% are people of color. He's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=77.46s)]
*  nominated groundbreaking first who would be the first black, Latino and AAPI judge to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=86.89999999999999s)]
*  serve in their circuit or district around the country. Today as we celebrate Justice [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=93.38s)]
*  Kintanji Brown Jackson's investiture, we also want to celebrate the many others across the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=99.22s)]
*  country making history. And the President is going to keep building on what he sees as one of his [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=105.34s)]
*  proudest accomplishments and he thanks the Senate for their leadership on this issue as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=111.10000000000001s)]
*  Finally, as you heard directly from the President a short time ago, our hearts are with everyone [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=116.7s)]
*  impacted by Hurricane Ian and also Hurricane Fiona. The President remains in regular touch with the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=124.98s)]
*  state and local officials and spoke with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and South Carolina Governor [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=132.04s)]
*  Henry McMaster this morning. FEMA Administrator DeAnn Criswell is also on the ground in Florida [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=137.79999999999998s)]
*  today. Since before the storm made landfall, President Biden has been clear that it is a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  priority for the entire administration to get those impacted by the storm help that they need. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=150.6s)]
*  One week ago, the President issued an emergency declaration for Florida which meant we could [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=157.96s)]
*  pre-position teams and resources like food, water and generators on the ground. Yesterday, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=163.56s)]
*  the President did the same thing for South Carolina in anticipation of the storm hitting there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=170.20000000000002s)]
*  Currently efforts are focused on saving lives and search and rescue as part of an unprecedented [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=175.96s)]
*  level of coordination with the Florida National Guard and state and local responders. Teams started [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=182.6s)]
*  search and rescue missions before daylight yesterday and are continuing that effort today. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=190.04s)]
*  By the end of yesterday, they had already saved hundreds of lives and completed thousands of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=195.95999999999998s)]
*  structural assessments allowing people to safely return to their homes. Federal teams are continuing [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=202.92s)]
*  to assess damage and work to restore critical services ensuring emergency power is available [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=208.76s)]
*  to critical infrastructure like hospitals and evaluating bridges, airports and ports as well. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=214.6s)]
*  We're also continuing to support the people of Puerto Rico as they recover from Hurricane Fiona. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=221.72s)]
*  We're providing support for emergency response, recovery and power restoration efforts and [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=228.2s)]
*  recovering 100% of the cost of public assistance, debris removal and more. We have over 1,000 federal [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=233.08s)]
*  response workers on the ground and we are providing millions of dollars to repair highways [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  and bridges as well. We are also investing millions of dollars to make Puerto Rico's [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=249.4s)]
*  infrastructure including its power grid more resilient to climate change. The people of Florida, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=254.28s)]
*  South Carolina, Puerto Rico and everyone impacted by these storms have the full support, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=260.84s)]
*  the full support of the federal government and as you can see today finally we are joined by [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the podium to talk about the United States response [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=274.44s)]
*  to Russia's attempts to annex parts of sovereign Ukraine and with that I will let Jake take to the [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=280.12s)]
*  podium. Go ahead Jake. Thank you for being here. Thank you, Corinne. As Corinne said, I will have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=286.52s)]
*  an update for you all on Russia but first I want to take a moment just as Corinne did to acknowledge [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  the devastation of Hurricane Ian and the millions of people who have been impacted by this terrible [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=299.96s)]
*  storm and as Corinne said and the President said earlier today, our hearts are with the people of [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=305.32s)]
*  Florida, South Carolina and the Southeast. As President Biden made clear, we're going to do [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=310.12s)]
*  everything we can across this White House and across this government to support the people who [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=315.72s)]
*  have been impacted by the storm with the full resources of the federal government as communities [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=322.12s)]
*  endeavor to recover and then to rebuild. I also want to say a special word of thanks to our first [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=327.40000000000003s)]
*  responders at every level of our government for everything they are doing and for the life-saving [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=332.92s)]
*  and dangerous missions they've undertaken over the last two days to keep people safe. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=338.12s)]
*  And if you'll indulge me just a word on what was a very important foreign policy development [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=343.47999999999996s)]
*  yesterday. President Biden hosted a historic U.S. Pacific Island country summit. He released the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=349.32s)]
*  first ever U.S. Pacific Island strategy. He announced over 810 million dollars in additional [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  expanded programs to help these countries combat the climate crisis, provide development assistance, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=364.44s)]
*  enhance maritime security and more. And finally, President Biden and all 12 Pacific Island [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  presidents who joined him here at the White House for this summit issued a joint declaration to [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=376.44s)]
*  strengthen our partnership and to chart an affirmative vision for the region. Today, as you [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=382.2s)]
*  all saw just a little bit ago, President Biden issued a strong condemnation of Russia's fraudulent [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=388.35999999999996s)]
*  attempt to annex sovereign Ukrainian territory. This act is a flagrant violation of international [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=394.92s)]
*  law and it has no legitimacy. Unfortunately, it's also not surprising. It's straight out of Putin's [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  playbook of deceit, disinformation and aggression and we've been warning about it for months. In [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=409.08000000000004s)]
*  fact, I've stood at this podium and warned about it several times, including as recently as last [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=414.76s)]
*  week. Based on our information, every aspect of this process was pre-staged and falsified [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=419.88s)]
*  under orders from the Kremlin. The sham referenda were held at gunpoint. Ukrainian civilians were [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=427.08s)]
*  forced to cast ballots through coercion, intimidation and in some cases under the watch of armed guards. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=433.8s)]
*  Saying that it somehow reflects the will of the people is an absurdity. The United States will [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=441.96s)]
*  never recognize these actions. The world will never recognize these actions and we will stay [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=448.68s)]
*  the course as the President told you earlier today. We have built, led and maintained an [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=454.36s)]
*  extraordinary and coordinated response with our allies and partners and that response will continue. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=460.36s)]
*  As President Biden said, we will not be deterred. So what does that mean specifically in reaction [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=466.2s)]
*  to what has just happened? First, as we saw from the Treasury Department and as the President [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=472.44s)]
*  underscored, we are sending a clear warning from the United States government supported by all of [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=478.2s)]
*  our G7 partners. We will sanction and impose export controls on any individual entity or country that [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=483.8s)]
*  provides political or economic support to these attempts at annexation. We have put in place [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=491.8s)]
*  authorities to enable us to do that rapidly and efficiently. We are also announcing new sanctions [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=497.96s)]
*  today that target additional Russian government officials and leaders including state Duma members [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=504.68s)]
*  who are accomplices in these fraudulent actions and including the central bank governor. We are [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=510.2s)]
*  also sanctioning Russian and Belorussian military officials and we have specifically targeted [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=516.6800000000001s)]
*  defense procurement networks including international suppliers supporting Russia's military industrial [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=521.64s)]
*  complex. Second, we will continue to provide military equipment so that Ukraine can defend [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=527.48s)]
*  its territory and its freedom. Today, President Biden will sign legislation from Congress that [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=533.8s)]
*  contains more than 12 billion dollars in additional funding for Ukraine and we are grateful for the [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=539.88s)]
*  continued support. There is no stronger, more bipartisan rebuke of what Russia has just done, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=545.4s)]
*  no more timely rebuke and no more assertive statement that we can make through resources [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=551.88s)]
*  and not just through words that we are going to continue to help Ukraine defend its territory [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=558.36s)]
*  and to de-occupy those parts that Russia has occupied. Earlier this week, we announced a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=564.92s)]
*  significant new billion dollar arms package which included 18 new high mars for Ukraine as part of [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=571.5600000000001s)]
*  our long-term commitment to strengthening Ukraine's armed forces over the years ahead and we expect to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=577.88s)]
*  have another announcement of immediate security assistance to announce next week. Next, the United [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=583.24s)]
*  States and the international community have been crystal clear that we will use diplomatic tools [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=589.64s)]
*  at our disposal to fundamentally reject Russia's attempts to take its neighbors' territory by force. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=595.24s)]
*  Today, the United States is supporting a resolution at the UN Security Council [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=602.2s)]
*  to condemn the sham referenda and to call on Russia immediately to withdraw its forces from Ukraine. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=606.52s)]
*  If Russia seeks to shield itself at the Security Council, the United Nations will work with partners [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=612.76s)]
*  around the world to take action next week at the UN General Assembly. Leaders around the world have [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=618.2800000000001s)]
*  spoken out about what's at stake. The independence of the democratic nation of Ukraine, the principles [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=625.24s)]
*  of sovereignty and territorial integrity and the very foundation of the United Nations Charter [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=631.24s)]
*  and the modern international order. As the Secretary General of the United Nations said yesterday, [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=638.44s)]
*  quote, it must not be accepted and it will not be accepted. To put it simply, the regions of Donetsk, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=644.12s)]
*  Luhansk, Khursan and Zaporizhzhia remain Ukrainian territory. Ukraine has every right to continue to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=651.88s)]
*  defend its sovereignty, which the people of Ukraine are doing bravely and courageously every day [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=658.36s)]
*  with the support of the international community and the United States for our part [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=663.96s)]
*  under President Biden's leadership. We'll support them at every step along the way [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=667.72s)]
*  for as long as it takes. And with that, I'd be happy to take your questions. Yeah. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=672.6800000000001s)]
*  Ukraine is seeking accelerated membership in NATO. Is that something that's possible or something [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=677.24s)]
*  you would seriously consider? The United States has been clear for decades that we support an [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=682.6s)]
*  open door policy for NATO. Any decision on NATO membership is between the 30 allies and the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=687.1600000000001s)]
*  countries aspiring to join. Right now, our view is that the best way for us to support Ukraine is [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=693.72s)]
*  through practical on the ground support in Ukraine and that the process in Brussels [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=699.96s)]
*  should be taken up at a different time. Yes. Thanks, Jake. In his speech this morning, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  the president called the Nord Stream pipeline attacks, quote, a deliberate act of sabotage. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=709.96s)]
*  And he said, now the Russians are pumping out misinformation and lies about it. Should we take [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=716.2s)]
*  that to mean that the US now believes that Russia was likely responsible for this act of sabotage? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=720.76s)]
*  Well, first, Russia has done what it frequently does when it is responsible for something, [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=726.92s)]
*  which is make accusations that it was really someone else who did it. We've seen this [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=731.24s)]
*  repeatedly over time. But the president was also clear today that there is more work to do on the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=734.6s)]
*  investigation before the United States government is prepared to make an attribution in this case. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=739.48s)]
*  One of the practical reasons for that is that because gas is emanating from these pipelines, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=744.04s)]
*  the Danish authorities and other authorities in the Baltic Sea can't actually get down [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=749.16s)]
*  to the source of the leak to do forensics on what appears to be an explosion. So we will have to [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=753.9599999999999s)]
*  wait until a combination of physical inspection, intelligence gathering, and consultation with our [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=760.12s)]
*  allies to make a definitive determination. But what we can say unequivocally is the suggestions [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=765.7199999999999s)]
*  Russia has made about the United States and other countries are flat out false. Russia knows they're [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=771.0s)]
*  false, but of course this is part of their playbook. But how many countries or entities [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=776.84s)]
*  are even capable of carrying out the kind of attack that we saw with hundreds of kilograms [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=780.36s)]
*  of explosives 250 feet below the surface of the sea? Not many. And I think this is obviously [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=785.8000000000001s)]
*  an act of sabotage that took place, we believe, in the neighborhood of 70 to 80 meters, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=792.9200000000001s)]
*  230 to 270 feet under the ocean. That takes some degree of sophistication. But I don't want to [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=798.36s)]
*  get ahead of myself in terms of asserting how exactly this happened or who exactly did it [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=805.08s)]
*  until we're standing on solid ground. We will continue to work with our allies and partners [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=810.2s)]
*  to gather all of the facts and then we will make a determination about where we go from there. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=814.2800000000001s)]
*  I have two questions. Putin clearly had nuclear weapons on his mind today when he was giving [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=818.44s)]
*  this speech. He said the West is deceitful, hypocritical. The United States is the only [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=823.0s)]
*  country to have used nuclear weapons. And he said, by the way, they have created a precedent. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=827.32s)]
*  How worrying is that to you? I've been clear myself, President Biden has been clear, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=832.52s)]
*  our administration has been clear that there is a risk given all of the loose talk and the nuclear [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=837.4s)]
*  saber rattling by Putin, that he would consider this. And we've been equally clear about what [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=842.68s)]
*  the consequences would be. We have communicated that directly to the Russians. We do not presently see [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=847.16s)]
*  indications about the imminent use of nuclear weapons. We are, of course, monitoring that [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=852.36s)]
*  carefully and staying in close consultation with allies and partners. But this is something that we [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=856.6s)]
*  are attuned to, taking very seriously and communicating directly with Russia about, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=861.24s)]
*  including the kind of decisive responses the United States would have if they went down that [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=865.72s)]
*  dark road. Is the risk that higher now than it was six or seven months ago? Well, what's interesting [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=870.44s)]
*  is that at various points over the course of this conflict, including right at the outset, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=875.8s)]
*  Putin has brandished the nuclear card. He's doing it again. So the risk has been there from the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  start. It's there today. I'm not going to characterize its exact level, only to say [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=885.4s)]
*  that we have been taking this seriously for some time, and we continue to take it seriously now. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=889.96s)]
*  Can I ask one broader question before you move on? What lessons from 2014 and from Crimea are you [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=894.0400000000001s)]
*  using now? What did you learn from that that you're applying here? Well, there's a number of just, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=900.0400000000001s)]
*  in terms of the tactics of how things unfolded in Crimea, including the fact that you didn't have [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=907.0s)]
*  the kind of sustained military conflict associated with it that you do in these cases, [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=913.64s)]
*  that means you cannot draw the analogy too far. On the other hand, one of the things that we have [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=919.5600000000001s)]
*  been clear about from the start of this conflict, and even in the months that preceded it, when I [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=924.44s)]
*  stood at this podium and warned that it was coming, is that we were going to be prepared [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=929.0s)]
*  with clear, swift, and very certain responses. And so when I stand here before you today to talk [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=933.0s)]
*  about sanctions, to talk about new funding, to talk about new transfers of military equipment, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=939.88s)]
*  and diplomatic initiatives that are unfolding the very day that Putin gives his speech, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=945.56s)]
*  that is all the product of months of planning and coordination with our allies and partners, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=950.3599999999999s)]
*  so that we do not allow time to elapse, so that we seize the diplomatic initiative, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=954.8399999999999s)]
*  and so that we communicate very clearly, we will not accept this, and we will help equip the [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=959.4s)]
*  Ukrainians to push back aggressively against it, even as we rally the international community [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=964.5999999999999s)]
*  to condemn it. That has been our strategy from the start. We have tried to be as clear and transparent [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=969.3199999999999s)]
*  about that as possible, warning what was going to come, indicating what we would do, and then [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=974.92s)]
*  following through and doing it. And that's what we're doing today. Would the U.S. actively enter [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=979.4s)]
*  the war if Putin used nukes on Ukraine? So I have said before that we have had the opportunity [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=985.3199999999999s)]
*  to communicate directly to Russia a range of consequences for the use of nuclear weapons and [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=992.04s)]
*  the kinds of actions the United States would take. I have also said before that we are not [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=997.64s)]
*  going to telegraph these things publicly. And so all I can tell you is that the Russians understand [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1001.32s)]
*  where things stand on this issue, we understand where things stand on this issue, and I will leave [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1007.6400000000001s)]
*  it at that. Do we run the risk though, if we're not moving more firepower to Europe right now, [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1012.2s)]
*  that we would be unprepared for a serious response if he were to take that kind of action tomorrow? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1016.2800000000001s)]
*  President Biden, even before this conflict began, moved a substantial number of additional U.S. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1022.6s)]
*  forces on land, sea, and air to Europe. After the conflict got underway, within 72 hours, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1029.0s)]
*  he had ordered the movement of even more forces beyond that. So we are standing at a level of [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1035.88s)]
*  enhanced force posture across the eastern flank, in the major maritime domains, and with all of [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1041.4s)]
*  the capabilities we need in the air as well. We feel that we have in place right now the capacity [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1047.96s)]
*  to effectively deter and respond to any contingency and to make good on what President Biden [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1055.48s)]
*  emphatically reinforced today, that we will defend every inch of NATO territory. The United States [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1061.8s)]
*  has put in place the pieces for that, and if you look at what our NATO allies have done, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1067.24s)]
*  in terms of surging their own capabilities to eastern flank allies, upping their own defense [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1071.64s)]
*  expenditures, we are at a level, a state of readiness to take on any contingency, and we're [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1076.3600000000001s)]
*  doing the active coordination and scenario planning to be prepared for whatever comes our way. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1083.24s)]
*  Is there anything we can do to protect energy infrastructure now before something that's actually [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1087.88s)]
*  in use gets attacked in Europe? The President mentioned today, actually, in response to a [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1093.48s)]
*  question, that we have in fact begun coordinating with allies to increase surveillance and monitoring [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1098.68s)]
*  of energy infrastructure, including pipelines in the Baltic Sea, and we will continue to work [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1104.44s)]
*  closely with Norway and other countries that have come out publicly and announced that they are [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1109.72s)]
*  stepping up their efforts in that regard. The United States has capabilities to be able to bring [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1114.04s)]
*  to bear, and we are bringing those to bear. Can you describe a little for us about the scenario [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1118.1200000000001s)]
*  planning? I would think that when this war began, there was a certain category of planning that has [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1123.08s)]
*  gone on, and how significantly has that changed, as the facts have changed, as these threats have [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1128.44s)]
*  changed. And does it suggest that this is a very dynamic situation where is the President engaged in [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1133.8s)]
*  approving new plans on a frequent basis, or is this something that is part of a ready playbook [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1141.56s)]
*  that would already be at the disposal of the Department of Defense, or is this something that's [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  being retooled in real time? There are elements that are consistent and elements that are dynamic, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1153.6399999999999s)]
*  and what I mean by that is from the very beginning, we've known the broad categories of forms of [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1159.16s)]
*  escalation that Russia could conceivably undertake. We've known the broad categories of contingencies [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1164.68s)]
*  that we might face, our allies might face, and Ukraine might face. But of course, as time goes on [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1170.52s)]
*  and circumstances change on the battlefield, and broader diplomatic circumstances change, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1176.76s)]
*  and as we gather new intelligence, we can refine the contingency planning within those broad [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1182.2s)]
*  categories to be more specific about different scenarios. And so over time, the President gets [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1188.2s)]
*  updates on the intelligence, updates on the likelihood or lack of likelihood of different [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1194.44s)]
*  circumstances, and refinements in the planning that's taking place across every element of our [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1201.24s)]
*  government, including the Defense Department, the intelligence community, the State Department, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1206.28s)]
*  USAID, the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation. We have people, experts, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1210.3600000000001s)]
*  from across our government working on a range of contingencies, and the President is in regular [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1215.88s)]
*  touch with his National Security Council principals to get updates on this and to give direction [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1220.5200000000002s)]
*  about how to continue to refine and sharpen these plans. The other thing that's happened is you've [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1225.72s)]
*  seen this steady stream of engagements President Biden has had with foreign counterparts, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1230.44s)]
*  particularly in NATO, the G7, the European Union. That has been an opportunity to engage on different [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1236.44s)]
*  scenarios and to make sure that the leaders of these countries are directing their teams to [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1243.08s)]
*  coordinate together so that we can have a common playbook for how we respond in different [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1248.04s)]
*  circumstances. That's been a very important planning function that's almost unprecedented in [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1253.0s)]
*  the intensity and frequency of engagement at the leader level in a circumstance like this. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1260.04s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about the sanctions. I know we've had batches of sanctions rolled out for the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1267.48s)]
*  last, say, seven months, and I wanted you to help us understand what makes you all confident that [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1272.12s)]
*  these latest sanctions would deter or change Putin's behavior when thus far we have not seen [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1277.4s)]
*  his behavior change. Well, so first, one of the key elements of our sanctions strategy has been to [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1283.32s)]
*  reduce the capacity of the Russian military machine to regenerate its ability to threaten [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1290.52s)]
*  Ukraine, and we think we have had an impact on that, denying inputs to the weapons of war [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1297.24s)]
*  that Putin wants to manufacture and place on the battlefield. Second, we have wanted to undermine [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1303.72s)]
*  Russia's major sectors in technology, in industry, and of course in defense so that its capacity to [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1310.2s)]
*  project power, threaten and coerce its neighbors, and wage wars of aggression is reduced over time, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1317.4s)]
*  and we think that there is demonstrable progress on that front as well. Third, we want to send a [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1323.5600000000002s)]
*  clear message to the rest of the world that those companies, those individuals, and those countries [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1328.92s)]
*  that are going to stand beside Russia on this issue of illegal annexation, they will subject [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1337.0800000000002s)]
*  themselves to sanctions, and we do believe that that will have a considerable deterrent effect, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1342.76s)]
*  and have seen that in other circumstances. So for all of these reasons, we feel that the sanctions [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1347.64s)]
*  element of our strategy, the economic pressure that we are placing on Russia, and the denial [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1353.72s)]
*  of their ability to gather what they need to be able to regenerate their war machine, [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1358.92s)]
*  this has been a critical element to how we have prosecuted our strategy so far, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1364.68s)]
*  and the impacts of it will continue to be felt month on month as we go forward, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1370.28s)]
*  and put us in a stronger position, and Russia in a more disadvantaged position as this unfolds. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1374.68s)]
*  Can I follow up on annexation? Can I just ask real quick on sort of the broader view of U.S. policy on [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1380.28s)]
*  annexation. Is it U.S. policy that any land gained by defensive or offensive war cannot be legally [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1385.56s)]
*  annexed? It is the U.S. policy that the attempt to annex at the point of a gun, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1393.96s)]
*  to conquer territory, hold sham referenda, and then declare that territory your sovereign territory, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1400.44s)]
*  and not your neighbor's sovereignty, is as flagrant a violation of the U.N. charter as possible, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1406.28s)]
*  and this case is cut and dried, and it's for that reason that the U.N. Secretary General, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1411.4s)]
*  who has been a careful voice, a neutral arbiter in multiple efforts on diplomacy between Russia [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1418.92s)]
*  and Ukraine over the last six months, came out with an absolutely unequivocal statement in this [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1427.0s)]
*  regard yesterday, and every word of it is something that the international community can collectively [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1432.04s)]
*  stand behind. Yeah? Do Russia's actions give you any second thoughts about enacting the oil price cap [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1437.16s)]
*  policy, which essentially would encourage countries to buy Russian oil at a discount, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1442.6s)]
*  as opposed to a full-out global ban? We're continuing down the road of negotiating alongside [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1447.32s)]
*  our G7 partners and working with countries who are prospective purchasers of Russian oil what [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1453.96s)]
*  the parameters in terms of a price cap would look like. We are not currently discussing a change in [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1461.56s)]
*  that policy, but rather continuing to find ways to both protect global energy markets and to deny [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1466.6s)]
*  revenues to Putin to feed his war machine. That is our fundamental objective. We believe this is [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1474.84s)]
*  the best method by which to achieve that objective, and we're not looking at a fundamental course [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1479.56s)]
*  correction on that at this time. Yeah? Are you concerned there could be attacks on U.S. and [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1483.8s)]
*  Western infrastructure after the Nord Stream 1 incident? We have to be concerned about the [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1487.9599999999998s)]
*  possibility of Russian action, Russian aggression against Western infrastructure, Western facilities. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1493.32s)]
*  We have been concerned about that from the beginning of the war. We don't have any specific [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1500.1999999999998s)]
*  intelligence to share with you today on that, but that is the reason we do contingency planning. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1504.36s)]
*  It is the reason that we send strong deterrent messages like the president today saying that [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1509.32s)]
*  the United States will defend every inch of NATO territory, and it's why the president said today [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1513.8799999999999s)]
*  that we've elevated our surveillance and monitoring of critical infrastructure in NATO territory in [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1518.6s)]
*  the event that it is put at risk, either physically or through cyber means or otherwise, and we will [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1524.84s)]
*  continue to do that. Is a heightened concern about that possibility? Well, before this war [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1529.8s)]
*  even began, I stood at this podium and said the possibility that we could see attacks in the United [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1535.32s)]
*  States, cyber attacks, or we could see attacks in Europe, whether physical or cyber was real. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1540.28s)]
*  It was real then. It remains real today, and what happened with Nord Stream 1 and 2 only reminds us [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1545.96s)]
*  that it is real. Yes? Thank you. There is a clear nexus between Russia and Iran regarding the drone [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1551.48s)]
*  program that threatened Ukraine. How worried are you about this, and is there any way to stop it? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1558.68s)]
*  And will you impose more sanctions on Iran in the aftermath of the killing of Ms. Amini that you [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1564.28s)]
*  yourself condemned, and also they issued some sanctions, but do we expect more sanctions on [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1569.96s)]
*  the Iranian regime? We continue to condemn the brutality and the repression against the brave [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1574.52s)]
*  citizens of Iran, the brave women of Iran who are simply marching for their rights and their dignity [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1580.1200000000001s)]
*  and their justice, and we continue to stand with them, not just in word, but indeed we have issued [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1585.08s)]
*  several sanctions against Iranian entities for what they have done in this killing and brutality, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1590.76s)]
*  and yes, we will continue to look for targets to impose sanctions in response to these brutal human [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1596.9199999999998s)]
*  rights violations. We have also issued sanctions with respect to the transfer of UAVs from Iran [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1603.6399999999999s)]
*  to Russia, and we are looking for additional methods to reduce Iran's capacity to be able to [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1610.12s)]
*  manufacture and then to sell these kinds of systems to Russia. We will continue to work on that, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1617.7199999999998s)]
*  and the entire world should see that Russia, as it runs into problems being able to regenerate [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1623.32s)]
*  its own capabilities, has to turn to other countries to try to get a hold of whatever [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1629.8s)]
*  kind of precision munition it can, including Iranian UAVs, that this is a move Russia has been [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1633.7199999999998s)]
*  forced to make because it is being denied inputs, and we're going to try and cut off other countries [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1638.76s)]
*  who Russia would seek to go out and approach to get these kinds of weapons to be able to feed [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1643.96s)]
*  their war machine in Ukraine. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1650.36s)]
*  Yes, thank you very quickly. I asked whether the profile of weapons and stuff being sent is changing [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1651.8799999999999s)]
*  in particular, whether you have a view on whether tanks should be provided to Ukraine either by the [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1657.16s)]
*  U.S. or by other countries facilitated by the U.S., and separately what we have, it's been about a [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1661.8799999999999s)]
*  year since that AUKUS deal was announced. What do you have any update on the status of that, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1666.84s)]
*  or the Australian is going to be buying American submarines, British submarines, or a combination [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1671.32s)]
*  of the two? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1675.9599999999998s)]
*  Actually, our leaders just recently put out a statement following the one-year anniversary of [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1677.1599999999999s)]
*  the AUKUS announcement, which took place last September just over a year ago, and we've made [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1682.9199999999998s)]
*  substantial progress over the course of the past year. We feel very good about the trilateral [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1687.9599999999998s)]
*  cooperation on the submarine program. We think that we have a good path forward. I'm not going [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1692.12s)]
*  to get into specifics on exactly what the nature of the platform will be. Some of the details of [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1696.44s)]
*  that need to continue to be worked out, but even more importantly, I need to protect the sensitivity [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1702.76s)]
*  of it. I will just say that our three countries are very much on the same page about the path [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1707.0s)]
*  forward, and there has been significant progress from concept one year ago to now the process of [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1711.3200000000002s)]
*  actually putting this in place. We also are pursuing a significant number of advanced [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1717.3200000000002s)]
*  capabilities through the AUKUS partnership in cyber, artificial intelligence, and other areas. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1721.8s)]
*  We've seen significant progress on those as well, and there are certain areas where we are looking [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1727.32s)]
*  to bring in other partners as well as part of an open platform approach. With respect to tanks, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1731.72s)]
*  we actually have facilitated the provision of tanks to Ukraine from some of our Eastern European [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1737.56s)]
*  partners who have provided the same type of Soviet-style tanks that the Ukrainian Army trained [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1743.32s)]
*  on and is in possession of, and we will continue to do that. In terms of other weapons systems, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1749.08s)]
*  what the President announced this week was a further provision of high Mars, which we have [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1754.6799999999998s)]
*  provided before. We expect the next package will be a re-up of many of the capabilities that the [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1760.1999999999998s)]
*  Ukrainians have moved so effectively, and I don't have any announcements of new and additional [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1765.56s)]
*  capabilities beyond that. What about NATO standard tanks? Jake, what about NATO standard tanks? [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1769.96s)]
*  Leopard tanks, like a higher, more modern tank, that's what is being sought by either the Ukrainians [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1775.24s)]
*  or advocates for it. Are you ruling that out, or is NATO ruling that out? I'm not ruling anything [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1780.44s)]
*  out. I will say I don't have any announcement on a U.S. tank today, and in terms of German tanks, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1785.16s)]
*  I would refer you to the Germans who are in their own consultations with the Ukrainians. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1789.48s)]
*  Sinner's Blumenthal and Graham introduced legislation yesterday that would cut off [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1795.4s)]
*  U.S. military and economic aid to nations that recognize Putin's annexation of Ukraine. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1800.2s)]
*  Does the White House support this proposal, or would it consider such a policy move like this? [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1806.3600000000001s)]
*  So I haven't had a chance to read the legislation, and in these circumstances the details end up [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1813.16s)]
*  mattering, but at a broad level, the basic proposition that we should be imposing economic [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1818.28s)]
*  costs on countries, individuals, and entities that are providing political and economic support to [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1823.96s)]
*  these annexations, not only do we agree with that, I just announced that from this podium today, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1829.4s)]
*  we are going to do that ourselves under executive authority, and I want to issue a clear warning to [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1835.72s)]
*  those who would think about providing political and economic support to these annexed territories, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1841.16s)]
*  or to Russia's efforts to justify and defend the annexation, you can be subject to U.S. sanctions [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1846.1200000000001s)]
*  as a result of those activities. We look forward to working with Senators Graham and Blumenthal [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1852.52s)]
*  on an approach in the Congress that could be consistent with and help drive that forward. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1857.24s)]
*  A couple of questions on Ukraine and then a follow-up on Iran if I may. I'd like to get the [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1863.0800000000002s)]
*  administration's reaction on President Zelensky's statement saying that we are ready for a dialogue [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1867.48s)]
*  with Russia but with another president of Russia. That's my first one, and then the second one is [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1872.6000000000001s)]
*  we understand that U.S. diplomats have been pressing Russia's allies to convince Putin to [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1878.2s)]
*  de-escalate. Can you be more specific about those kinds of overtures? In what ways does [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1883.32s)]
*  the administration believe that China and India can apply more pressure on Moscow to de-escalate, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1888.68s)]
*  not go the nuclear route? So on your second question, we think any country that believes [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1895.24s)]
*  in the principles of the U.N. Charter, and frankly that should be every country that's signed up to [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1901.64s)]
*  the U.N. Charter, should be taking on its measure of responsibility to communicate directly to the [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1905.72s)]
*  Kremlin that what it is doing is wrong, it is unjustified, and it must stop. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1911.72s)]
*  We are asking that of countries around the world. We'd like them to speak out publicly, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1916.28s)]
*  and we would like them to convey things privately, diplomatically. With respect to the first question, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1920.04s)]
*  which was, I'm sorry, President Zelensky saying that he's ready for a dialogue with Russia but [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1925.96s)]
*  with another president of Russia. President Zelensky has consistently said throughout this conflict [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1930.68s)]
*  that the war ultimately will end through diplomacy, and we have consistently backed him up in that. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1936.28s)]
*  I would have to refer you to him on that precise statement and what he means by it, [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1942.92s)]
*  but what I will tell you is that we have had daily engagement with the president, his chief of staff, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1946.3600000000001s)]
*  his foreign minister, his defense minister, and much communication, of course, between [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1952.8400000000001s)]
*  our military and their military to make sure that we are understanding one another well, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1959.56s)]
*  that we are transparent about the support we're providing and the strategy they're pursuing. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1965.4s)]
*  That continues today, and that will continue every day from here on out. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1970.6000000000001s)]
*  Does it show the sentiment of President Zelensky that a dialogue is only possible with another [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1973.3200000000002s)]
*  president and not Vladimir Putin? I don't know the context of the statement, unfortunately, so [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1978.2800000000002s)]
*  I can't answer it in the characterization you've just provided. What I will say is that President [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1983.24s)]
*  Biden believes that a diplomatic solution in Ukraine is possible, but it is only possible [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1988.2s)]
*  according to the basic terms of the UN Charter that everybody signed up to. That's what he said [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1993.32s)]
*  in his UN speech last week. He continues to believe that quite strongly, and in his conversations with [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=1997.8799999999999s)]
*  President Zelensky, they've been of the same mind on that point. On the pipeline, did I hear you [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2003.8s)]
*  correctly to say that the US government has ruled out the involvement of any European allies, [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2011.72s)]
*  including Eastern European countries? Some of them are very angry about that pipeline and [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2015.8s)]
*  in the sabotage? We do not believe that this was the work of any NATO ally. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2019.8799999999999s)]
*  Then more broadly, Putin in his speech cast this as a kind of cultural struggle with Russia [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2025.32s)]

*  traditional values and things like that. How do you answer that argument? [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2035.32s)]
*  It's raving. The fact that he's using words like Satanism is to me precisely the kind of [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2040.2s)]
*  over-the-top rhetoric and ranting that you hear from someone who has no basis to justify what is [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2049.88s)]
*  a colonial and imperial land grab. Rather than fill in any kind of logic or moral defense of [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2056.2000000000003s)]
*  what he has done, he has to resort to these kinds of absurd arguments. I think that can be plain for [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2063.7200000000003s)]
*  the entire world to see. Thank you, Jake. On another topic, what is your expectation for [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2069.24s)]
*  the election in Brazil this Sunday? What are you going to be watching for and how fast is the [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2078.68s)]
*  White House going to recognize the result once it's announced? I don't make predictions about [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2084.12s)]
*  American elections, so I promise you I will not make predictions about Brazilian elections or [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2090.8399999999997s)]
*  elections of any other country. Thank you, guys. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2095.3199999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much, Jake. We don't have much time because I know folks have to gather, [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2104.04s)]
*  but Colleen, you want to kick us off? Sure. Kareem, can you give us an update on the [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2109.72s)]
*  president's plans? Will he go to Florida? Will he go to Puerto Rico? And then also, [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2114.7599999999998s)]
*  do you have any idea how much money you'll have to request from Congress yet to replenish [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2121.08s)]
*  the disaster fund? I'll say this. The continuing resolution in Congress, as you all know, [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2128.68s)]
*  they're voting on this all today, so we'll help ensure that FEMA has the resources it needs to [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2137.24s)]
*  address immediate response and recovery needs, including those in Puerto Rico and also in Florida. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2142.2799999999997s)]
*  We will remain in close touch, obviously, with Congress on continuing to evaluate that. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2147.48s)]
*  As far as what's currently happening, the president's been very clear. He wants to focus [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2155.96s)]
*  on what Florida needs, what Puerto Rico needs, and they both have the full force and the full [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2162.6s)]
*  support of the federal government. We will continue to have close conversations with the [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2169.4s)]
*  officials on the ground to make sure that they have the people in Puerto Rico and the people in [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2176.12s)]
*  Florida have what they need. As you heard, he spoke to the South Carolina governor today, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2181.88s)]
*  offering that same support. One of the things that I just want to reiterate, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2187.96s)]
*  which is really important about what we have seen these last couple of days, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2193.88s)]
*  actually more than a week, is if you think about what the president was able to do in Florida and [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2199.0s)]
*  what the president's going to be able to do in South Carolina, which is pre-position [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2203.24s)]
*  federal employees, responders on the ground in a way that we have not seen before. It is unprecedented [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2210.6s)]
*  what we're seeing, the type of coordination that we're seeing on the ground. That is because the [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2216.2799999999997s)]
*  president has made this a priority and he wants to make sure that we are offering all of the support. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2221.56s)]
*  Just to name a few, because this is, we think, important. It's the FEMA Urban Search and Rescue, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2228.2s)]
*  the U.S. Coast Guard, the Department of Defense, DHS, the Department of the Interior, working hand [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2234.2799999999997s)]
*  in hand with the Florida National Guard and state and local responders. These teams are doing [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2239.7999999999997s)]
*  the work day and night to make sure that they're rescuing folks on the ground, but also offering [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2245.64s)]
*  water, food, and generators as well. When the president does go to Florida, whenever that might [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2250.52s)]
*  be, does he want to meet with Governor DeSantis personally? I want to be very clear about this. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2257.24s)]
*  This is not about politics. This is about the people of Florida and what they need. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2263.3199999999997s)]
*  When we saw Surfside, the horrible, catastrophic building falling in Surfside and killing so many [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2269.4799999999996s)]
*  Floridians not too long ago, over a year ago, you saw Governor DeSantis and you saw this president [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2278.2s)]
*  sit side by side talking about how they were going to work together to make sure that that [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2285.0s)]
*  community got everything that they need. So this is not about politics. I don't have anything to share [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2290.6s)]
*  about a trip that the president is going to be making. He spoke for himself yesterday. He [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2295.88s)]
*  is something that he wants to do when it's appropriate in Florida. He does want to also [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2303.16s)]
*  go to Puerto Rico, and once we have an announcement to make, we surely will make that announcement. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2308.36s)]
*  Apparently a meeting today between the administration and oil executives. Could [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2313.16s)]
*  you tell us a little bit about that? What's that for? For sure. So from what I understand, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2316.7599999999998s)]
*  as you stated, there is a meeting that happened with the Department of Energy. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2322.44s)]
*  With the oil companies, don't have anything to share at this time as to how that meeting went [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2328.92s)]
*  or what was on the agenda. But certainly it is an important meeting as we look at continuing to [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2334.68s)]
*  keep those gas prices and oil prices down for the American people as soon as I'm sure there will be [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2342.36s)]
*  a readout and some more information to share to all of you. Yesterday, President Biden said that [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2348.76s)]
*  Governor DeSantis, when they spoke, complimented him and praised the immediate response from the [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2353.2400000000002s)]
*  federal government. Is that a sentiment that the president returns? Does he think Governor [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2357.56s)]
*  DeSantis has handled the response to this well so far? So I can't speak to the specifics of a [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2361.7200000000003s)]
*  private conversation. I can say that we gave a readout from our end about how the conversation [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2370.6s)]
*  went. Again, we don't want to make this about politics. We don't want to make this about [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2378.76s)]
*  red states versus blue states. This is about the American people that are [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2384.12s)]
*  families and everyday people who are on the ground who need the assistance. And they are going to [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2390.52s)]
*  continue to coordinate. They are going to continue to have conversations. They had, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2395.48s)]
*  I believe, three conversations in just a week's time about what they can do to help the communities [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2399.0s)]
*  in Florida. But I don't want to get into politics here because this is not about that. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2406.2s)]
*  Right. I'm not asking about politics. I'm just asking if the president thinks that Governor [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2410.2s)]
*  DeSantis has done a good job. I'm just not going to. Look, I haven't had that conversation with [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2413.24s)]
*  the president. What I can tell you is that they are working closely together. The FEMA administrator [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2416.76s)]
*  is down there currently with the governor. They are traveling the state together and looking at [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2423.48s)]
*  what is currently happening on the ground. I'm not going to get into particulars of who's doing [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2429.64s)]
*  a good job and who's doing a, you know, I don't know, could do a better job, I should say. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2434.36s)]
*  Right now, we are working closely hand in hand with the officials on the ground. We have had [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2440.68s)]
*  multiple conversations, not just this president, but also the FEMA administrator. And you can see [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2445.32s)]
*  the fact that they've had conversations, the fact that the FEMA administrator is on the ground, [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2450.6s)]
*  that this is a working relationship that is about the people of Florida. I'm not going to get into [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2456.68s)]
*  scorecards here. I don't think you got called. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2461.96s)]
*  Yeah. Thanks. Just real quick, is the president, the president will sign the CR today? Is that the [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2465.48s)]
*  idea? That's a very good question. I don't have any specifics on that. I know it takes some time. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2470.68s)]
*  There's mechanics that need to be handled on the Congress side before a bill gets here. I don't [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2476.2s)]
*  have any specifics on when that gets signed. Clearly, he will sign it as soon as he's able [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2481.48s)]
*  to do that. Okay. And is the White House still committed to an early October timeline for the [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2485.56s)]
*  application for student loans to go public? Yesterday, there was an email that went out to [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2491.48s)]
*  some borrowers that said October, generally. It didn't say early October. I don't have a specific [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2495.4s)]
*  date in October, but let me just, since you mentioned the email, yesterday we began the first [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2502.12s)]
*  of what will be regular updates to borrowers interested in debt relief. We shared information [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2508.2s)]
*  of what people can expect in the coming weeks around the program and process for applying. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2513.96s)]
*  We shared the following. The application for debt relief will be available next month in October. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2519.24s)]
*  No date set yet, but we will next month. It's this month. We are in October, right? Or tomorrow. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2524.2799999999997s)]
*  Tomorrow we're in October. The application will be a short online form. Borrowers won't need to [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2529.3199999999997s)]
*  upload any documents or use their FSAID to support their application. The application will be [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2535.16s)]
*  available from October 2022 through December 2023. Once an individual submits a form, the [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2541.56s)]
*  Department of Education will review the application, determine if the individual is eligible for relief, [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2549.3199999999997s)]
*  and will work with their loan server to process the relief. Our goal, as you all know, and we have [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2555.08s)]
*  said this, is to provide borrowers a seamless and simple experience working closely with the [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2561.16s)]
*  servicers who will actually process the relief. We will have additional information for borrowers [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2566.7599999999998s)]
*  in the upcoming days. Again, I know you're asking for a specific date, but that was what we provided [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2572.7599999999998s)]
*  in the email, and we should have more soon to share. Do we have any week ahead guidance for next [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2577.3199999999997s)]
*  week? I know that you don't want to say anything about the trip to Puerto Rico or Florida. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2581.8799999999997s)]
*  You know, we usually put out our week aheads for those who follow their week aheads coming out of [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2585.3199999999997s)]
*  here on Sundays. If there is a trip next week, we certainly will share that with you. We don't have [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2592.2799999999997s)]
*  anything to announce at this time at the podium. No, I understand. You've been here for 19 months, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2598.2799999999997s)]
*  and we've always done the week aheads on Sundays. I know, I hear you. I get it, but I'm just, I'm just, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2605.72s)]
*  oh yeah, that's right. We just don't have, I hear what you're saying. We just don't have anything [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2611.48s)]
*  today for Friday to share. I get the question. I got it, but normally, yes, we do our week aheads [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2614.92s)]
*  that we send out on Sundays, and you're right, we used to do that on Fridays. I just don't have [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2620.6s)]
*  anything to share, and we will try and be more proactive in doing that on Fridays, for sure. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2624.68s)]
*  Go ahead, Jackie. Thanks, Doreen. A couple times this week, the president came after oil and gas [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2630.84s)]
*  companies. He threatened again to investigate instances of price gouging, but John Curley said [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2636.28s)]
*  yesterday that there, we haven't seen any evidence of that happening, and I remember the president [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2642.6800000000003s)]
*  first put out this, this call for the FTC to investigate possible price gouging in November [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2647.2400000000002s)]
*  of last year. So my question to you is, why does he keep throwing that out there, and does it have [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2652.76s)]
*  anything to do with the possibility that OPEC could announce a production cut next week, and [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2658.6000000000004s)]
*  might start to see prices come up? Is he trying to deflect away from? So, as you know, we're not [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2663.88s)]
*  going to speak to OPEC, OPEC Plus. We are clearly not a partner or part of OPEC Plus. They are an [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2669.0800000000004s)]
*  independent entity, and we allow them to make their news and their announcements on their own. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2677.1600000000003s)]
*  What we're saying is we're just making sure that while people are dealing, what we are all dealing [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2684.36s)]
*  with, a hurricane, that gas and oil companies don't take advantage of it. It's just a little bit [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2689.88s)]
*  of a, hey, we want to make sure in this time when people are losing their homes, when people are [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2697.08s)]
*  dealing with an incredibly difficult time, that we shouldn't take advantage of it. That's it. It is [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2702.84s)]
*  just coming from the president, and we feel that coming from the president is a powerful voice. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2707.1600000000003s)]
*  And so, look, we know that disruptions from hurricanes can pose challenge to markets, [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2713.6400000000003s)]
*  but the latest projections show that major refineries should not be impacted by Hurricane [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2719.56s)]
*  Ian. And so, we're just making it very clear to the oil companies. The president is making it very [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2725.88s)]
*  clear to the oil companies. So, there's nothing more to it than just being vigilant about that. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2731.4s)]
*  Does it all run the risk of further fraying the relationship between the administration and these? [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2737.48s)]
*  There's been obviously some space between their position, industry head's position, and the [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2742.92s)]
*  White House in terms of attitudes toward fossil fuels and sort of casting a blame from side to [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2750.76s)]
*  side. Companies will say, well, the Biden administration is hostile, and that's why [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2756.28s)]
*  we can't ramp up production. Does this kind of rhetoric make it worse? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2761.2400000000002s)]
*  So, as you know, the oil companies are currently meeting with officials, White House officials, [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2764.2000000000003s)]
*  and the Department of Energy. And so, look, I think the president thinks that he is standing [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2770.52s)]
*  up for the American people and making sure that oil companies are passing on the savings that they're [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2776.44s)]
*  getting to consumers. And we have said that time and time again. And this is something that the [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2783.32s)]
*  president thinks it's important to use his platform to do so. Thanks, Karine. Can you give us a... I [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2787.8s)]
*  know you're not going into the week ahead, but for the weekend, President Biden is in town, [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2795.64s)]
*  going to the Congressional Black Caucus dinner tomorrow night. Are there other things he's doing [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2800.2799999999997s)]
*  this weekend, anything related to the hurricane that he's planning to...? [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2804.12s)]
*  Well, he is getting regularly, daily updated on Hurricane Ian, as you've heard him say many times. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2807.48s)]
*  If we have anything else to share, we certainly will. As I mentioned, Administrator Criswell is [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2815.16s)]
*  in Florida. So when she... either before she gets back or when she gets back, she certainly will give [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2821.16s)]
*  the president an update on what she saw on the ground. So that'll be very important. And she has [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2826.52s)]
*  spoken to him many, many times, multiple times this week. So again, he'll get a daily update, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2831.0s)]
*  as he has been for the past week or so on both Hurricane Fiona, when that was happening currently [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2836.28s)]
*  with this hurricane. And we will have more to share if there's any other calls [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2842.04s)]
*  that he makes on the ground with officials as well. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2846.28s)]
*  The other thing I wanted to ask was, you had said the other day that Jack Walensky's family [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2849.24s)]
*  was going to be here today for a bill signing. Has that happened? Is it happening? It wasn't on [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2853.72s)]
*  the schedule as well. Yeah. As you all know, we don't put every bill signing on the schedule. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2858.12s)]
*  As you can imagine, this is a personal moment that the president was doing. Like I mentioned [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2865.16s)]
*  in the briefing a couple of days ago, and as you just stated, the president has been looking [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2872.12s)]
*  forward to hosting the late representative's family and other lawmakers to honor her legacy. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2875.9599999999996s)]
*  And he is signing the bill, naming a post office in her memory. And that is happening. It was [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2883.0s)]
*  happening when we started the briefing. So I haven't gotten an update on how that went. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2887.64s)]
*  But clearly, this is an important moment for her family. And so I can give you a little bit [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2892.9199999999996s)]
*  of who was in the meeting so that you all know. It included the late representative's husband, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2901.16s)]
*  mother, brother, staff, and several bipartisan members of Congress, Speaker Pelosi, minority [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2907.08s)]
*  leader Kevin McCarthy, Representative Jim Baird, Representative Jim Banks. So this again happened [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2913.08s)]
*  while I was coming to the podium. And as you know, the majority of bill signings are not [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2919.24s)]
*  necessarily always done in public. And so this is that example as well. So Kevin McCarthy was here [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2925.56s)]
*  for the bill signing. Is that the first time he has met? [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2931.88s)]
*  I don't have kind of a data on how many times he's been here. So I actually can't speak to that at [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2935.1600000000003s)]
*  this time. But he was here for this particular bill signing. We have to remember that the issue [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2943.4s)]
*  that she fought so hard for on ending hunger, ending child hunger specifically, has been an [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2948.52s)]
*  issue that's been bipartisan. And that's what we saw a couple of days ago from that summit. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2957.32s)]
*  The Education Department yesterday tweaked some eligibility issues with the student loan [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2962.52s)]
*  forgiveness plan that basically say that borrows with federal loans that are owned by private banks [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2969.88s)]
*  are now ineligible. It will affect perhaps 770,000 borrows. I've also seen a couple million. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2976.92s)]
*  Just curious, is that a disappointment for the White House that you have to make this change [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2983.6400000000003s)]
*  seemingly around some legal issues? And could there be future changes before applications are [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2987.96s)]
*  made that could narrow eligibility further? Or is the plan final now? [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2993.48s)]
*  So first I just want to make sure, because I know this was out there, that the number of [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=2999.08s)]
*  borrows impacted in this change is much smaller. I know there was a number of millions, but it's [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3003.2400000000002s)]
*  actually much smaller. So our goal from day one has always been to deliver relief to many [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3010.28s)]
*  borrows as possible, as quickly as possible. And this change helps us achieve that. So we will [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3016.52s)]
*  continue to make sure we zero in on that. Look, the Department of Education continues to explore [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3021.8s)]
*  alternative ways to provide relief to those borrows with commercially held loans. I do want to say [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3026.36s)]
*  that when you think about what we're trying to do, we're trying to give relief to everyday [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3035.16s)]
*  Americans. We're trying to give relief to working families. We're trying to give relief to working [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3043.48s)]
*  Americans. And the fact that you see folks out there in Republican states that are making it [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3050.04s)]
*  very hard for us to do that, for us to give a little bit of a breathing room to working Americans, [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3056.36s)]
*  I think it's really unfortunate. Because what we are doing is actually popular with Americans. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3063.48s)]
*  What we are doing is actually giving Americans an opportunity to put money down on a house, [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3069.24s)]
*  an opportunity to start a family. And so that is what, unfortunately, we're seeing that these [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3074.4399999999996s)]
*  red state Republican officials are doing. And remember, this is going to help 40 million [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3082.52s)]
*  Americans who truly, really need just a little bit more space. [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3088.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you anticipate, though, that the plan is now final? Or could there be other [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3092.8399999999997s)]
*  modifications like this before the end? I can't speak to that. What I can say is we're [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3096.76s)]
*  going to do everything that we can to explore alternative ways to give relief to those borrows, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3102.36s)]
*  these particular borrows that you were asking me about that are with commercially held loans. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3110.2000000000003s)]
*  And so we're going to do everything that we can. The Department of Education is going to do [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3117.7200000000003s)]
*  everything that they can. Again, this is about giving relief, a little bit of breathing rooms, [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3121.4s)]
*  extra kind of opportunity for folks to really be able to get that house again, to start that family. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3127.4s)]
*  And so that's what we're going to continue to focus on. I think I have to go. I'm getting the... [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3136.44s)]
*  But I'll see you all next week. And we will have a week ahead as soon as we can. Thanks, everybody. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tl9lnihc1RA&t=3140.92s)]
