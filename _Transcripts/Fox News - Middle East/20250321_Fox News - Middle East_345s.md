# Trump sends OMINOUS warning to Iran over Houthis: 'Completely annihilated!'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc)
*  So President Trump sending a message to Iran on Truth Social saying Iran must stop the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=0.0s)]
*  sending of these supplies immediately. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=5.92s)]
*  Let the Houthis fight it out for themselves. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=7.86s)]
*  They will be completely annihilated. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=10.64s)]
*  The warning comes ahead of a White House meeting with Israel over Iran's nuclear program early [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=12.32s)]
*  next week. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=17.14s)]
*  Fox News senior strategic analyst, retired four-star General Jack Keene, remember the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=18.14s)]
*  president sent a letter to the Grand Ayatollah, said you have two months to comply or else [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=22.02s)]
*  all bets are off. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=26.8s)]
*  Do you think Iran, how do you think Iran is digesting these messages from the Trump administration? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=28.92s)]
*  Well, certainly I think based on the evidence that, you know, the first administration that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=33.92s)]
*  they dealt with, they know they're serious. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=44.2s)]
*  Listen, Iran is so much back on their heels, never have been in this place in 44 years. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=45.2s)]
*  I mean, they're completely defenseless at home in terms of an attack by Israel, you [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=51.24s)]
*  know, with the United States cooperating. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=57.16s)]
*  They know that. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=59.279999999999994s)]
*  They've lost their strategic platform in Syria and their proxies, except for the Houthis, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  you know, have been decimated. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=65.52s)]
*  And now the Houthis, you know, are on the path to destruction as well. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=66.52s)]
*  The one thing they have left that they're really holding on to and want to hold on to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=71.14s)]
*  is their nuclear enterprise development. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  They know if they acquire a nuclear weapon, it guarantees the preservation of the regime [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=78.4s)]
*  in their minds. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=83.44s)]
*  And that's why they've always wanted this weapon to begin with. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=84.92s)]
*  So I think they're going to do everything they can to delay, delay, delay the inevitable, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=88.04s)]
*  which was likely we're on a path to Israel-led U.S.-supported strike to take down their nuclear [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=94.16s)]
*  enterprise as much as possible. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=100.8s)]
*  Do we do sayâ€” [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=102.28s)]
*  Course of diplomacy first, that's what the president is doing. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=103.28s)]
*  And then a follow-on military operation if they don't comply. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=106.38s)]
*  You know, immediately they said, how dare you give us an ultimatum? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=109.84s)]
*  And now they said we are writing a letter back to Trump after his initial letter. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=112.46s)]
*  How significant was last weekend's hit on the Houthis? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=116.5s)]
*  We've heard Israel hit them. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=119.13999999999999s)]
*  We've hit them before. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  Was anything different about last week? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=121.25999999999999s)]
*  Well, I think what has really happened is the scale and magnitude. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=123.97999999999999s)]
*  I mean, there's been like 89, 90-plus sorties run against the Houthis. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=130.18s)]
*  We've never done anything like that, you know, since they began attacking a shipping in the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=134.62s)]
*  Red Sea on October the 19th. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=139.57999999999998s)]
*  So this is the most consequential attack for sure. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=142.3s)]
*  We're challenged because the Houthis have been under air campaign from the Kingdom of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=146.06s)]
*  Saudi Arabia and the UAE for almost seven years, and a lot of what they do is underground. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=150.06s)]
*  They proved that they could sustain significant attacks against them during those seven years. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=155.68s)]
*  We don't have anybody on the ground, so the targets are challenging. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=162.10000000000002s)]
*  That is why the president's warning to Iran is so significant. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=165.5s)]
*  He's telling you, I'm going to hold you accountable if you continue to support these Houthis. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=169.86s)]
*  And the CENTCOM commander, the same one that recommended to Biden over 100 targets inside [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=175.66000000000003s)]
*  of Iran, military targets only, to shut down support for the Houthis and other proxies, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=180.78s)]
*  the Biden administration rejected it. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=188.0s)]
*  Certainly the Trump administration has those targets, and they have a commander that's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=190.58s)]
*  willing to obviously shoot them and the secretary of defense that feels the same way about it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=194.34s)]
*  He's got that quiver ready to use, that arrow in his quiver ready to use. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=199.82s)]
*  Coercive diplomacy being used here as well. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=206.5s)]
*  Get Iran's attention, get them to stop. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=209.26s)]
*  If they don't do it, we're going to have to force them. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=211.5s)]
*  Another round of talks, Russia and Saudi Arabia with the U.S. after last week's phone call. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=214.34s)]
*  Right now they said, okay, we won't hit each other's energy. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=220.82s)]
*  You just mentioned to me before they still hit energy and they just had a huge drone attack [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=223.22s)]
*  in Odessa last night. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=227.98s)]
*  What do you expect to happen? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=229.54s)]
*  If you're the U.S., what do you tell Russia to do next or what do you try to get out of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=230.74s)]
*  them next? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=235.42s)]
*  Well first of all, let's admit that we do have a defined peace process taking place. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=238.42s)]
*  I mean there's talks with the Russians and the negotiating team next week. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=244.78s)]
*  There'll be talks with the Ukrainians and negotiating teams, separate rooms to be sure, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=249.3s)]
*  both sides putting their terms and conditions on the table and the negotiating teams will [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=254.54s)]
*  try to resolve those differences. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=259.86s)]
*  That is a peace process. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  But I think there's also genuine skepticism on the part of the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=264.53999999999996s)]
*  How serious is Russia? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=270.34s)]
*  I mean they talk nice to the president certainly, but they play hard in these negotiations, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=272.14s)]
*  whether they're willing to compromise or not. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=277.86s)]
*  I think by the end of this week we'll have a pretty good feel if Russia is willing to [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=279.94s)]
*  move the ball, one, to a ceasefire. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=284.58s)]
*  Maybe the next step is a moratorium on operations in the Black Sea and then eventually the 30-day [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=287.58s)]
*  ceasefire that Ukraine has already been willing to sign up for. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=294.18s)]
*  Russia is not there yet. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=298.74s)]
*  That would be step one. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=300.58s)]
*  The fact that President Trump is still wanting to do the mineral deal with Ukraine is a good [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=301.98s)]
*  strengthens a strategic generational relationship with Ukraine. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=307.34s)]
*  Russia does not want the United States to do whatsoever. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=312.38s)]
*  And this gives us additional leverage in these peace talks. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=316.38s)]
*  All right, General, we'll continue to look at the Institute for the Study of War to find [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=319.7s)]
*  out all the hot spots, which you also run on a daily basis. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=324.02s)]
*  Thanks so much, General. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=327.78s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jEyPwKlNfjc&t=328.78s)]
