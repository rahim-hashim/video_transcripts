# Leader of Hamas believes he'll survive: 'Wind at his back'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk)
*  The historic pact could be on the horizon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. and Saudi Arabia are reportedly close to a security-related agreement that normalizes [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=1.92s)]
*  Israel-Saudi relations. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=6.94s)]
*  They recognize each other. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=8.52s)]
*  The potential deal would amount to a new version of a framework that would be scuttled by the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=9.92s)]
*  Israeli Hamas war that was scuttled and could reshape the Middle East. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=14.58s)]
*  The President Trump was on path to doing that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=18.76s)]
*  Peter Reac, Fox News, senior strategic analyst, retired four-star General Jack Keene. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=21.2s)]
*  I know on some level many people are surprised they're talking about this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=26.6s)]
*  What has to happen first for them to normalize relations? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=30.8s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, let's just state likely a lot of the reasons for the war in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=35.24s)]
*  Gaza and for Iran operationalizing all of their proxies in coordination with what Hamas [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=40.5s)]
*  was doing was to break this deal because it was moving towards a very positive solution. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  You're right, it was started by the previous administration, the Abraham Accords. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=54.92s)]
*  But it is quite remarkable that while the war in Gaza is raging, the crown prince of [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=59.440000000000005s)]
*  Saudi Arabia is still moving in this direction, initially first with the United States and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=64.92s)]
*  then eventually with Israel itself. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=70.72s)]
*  The deal with the United States would be a security arrangement similar to what we have [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=73.80000000000001s)]
*  with South Korea, Japan and the Philippines, help them with civilian nuclear power and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=78.36s)]
*  some kind of an arms deal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=84.32s)]
*  In return, Saudi Arabia would normalize relations with Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=85.88s)]
*  But that would not take place until the war in Gaza ends and there would have to be some [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=91.32s)]
*  kind of a pathway toward a Palestinian state. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=97.19999999999999s)]
*  Listen, the Arabs want no part of Hamas. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=100.56s)]
*  There's no future dealing with Hamas. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  They are completely focused on what the major threat to the region is, Iran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  And that is why they want to normalize relations with Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=111.04s)]
*  Also, there's an economic benefit to doing all of that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=114.44000000000001s)]
*  But they do want to see some movement towards a Palestinian state in the same regard. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=118.84s)]
*  They want no part of the Palestinian Authority leadership that exists in the West Bank. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=123.56s)]
*  They believe they're corrupt. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  They've never accomplished anything and there has to be some fundamental reform here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=129.6s)]
*  So, two pieces have to fall in place, the US, Saudi, which is working towards completion [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  and then Saudi and Israel with the conditions and realities I just mentioned. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=139.72s)]
*  So we're putting massive pressure on Netanyahu to come up with some type of peace deal. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=144.48s)]
*  Hamas has been walking away, but now they're considering a peace deal. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=148.0s)]
*  They want a ceasefire, a permanent ceasefire. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=151.16s)]
*  They want no raid on Ra'a, obviously. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=154.02s)]
*  And they want to allow the Palestinians to return to the north. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=156.92s)]
*  The Israelis say, yeah, we'll give a pause, a temporary ceasefire, but we're still going [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=161.28s)]
*  into Ra'a. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=165.7s)]
*  How much leverage do we have over Israel to take a deal that's not in their interest? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=167.36s)]
*  Well, certainly the administration is pushing Israel in that direction, but they've been [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=173.56s)]
*  pretty steadfast here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=180.16000000000003s)]
*  Sinwar, who is the leader of Hamas in Gaza, he's calling the shots there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=181.96s)]
*  And what he really wants is an end to the war. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=187.06s)]
*  He has not accepted any proposal since the deal was made back in November with the release [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  of the 40 hostages. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=196.76s)]
*  And because he believes the wind is at his back. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=198.56s)]
*  He's got growing international condemnation of Israel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=201.01999999999998s)]
*  He's got the United States openly disagreeing with Israel's war aims and pushing them to [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=204.28s)]
*  a place they really don't want to be. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  And that's why he's been delayed, because what he wants to do is survive with his leaders [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=212.44s)]
*  and survive with enough of Hamas fighters so he can rebuild his organization. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=217.23999999999998s)]
*  He already thinks in his mind that he's achieved a major strategic victory in terms of the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=223.68s)]
*  political isolation and condemnation of Israel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=229.28s)]
*  So he's playing those cards pretty close to his chest. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=232.8s)]
*  It's not that he wouldn't make a deal if he thought that the temporary ceasefire could [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=236.32s)]
*  lead to a permanent ceasefire. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=242.36s)]
*  And there is certainly a lot of pressure on Israel for that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=245.62s)]
*  The pressure on Netanyahu certainly is one, get the hostages released. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  And you can see that mounting pressure has taken place in Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=253.56s)]
*  And two, make sure he cleans up the rest of Hamas and Ra'afah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=257.88s)]
*  Those are his two pressure points that he's actually dealing with here. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=262.76s)]
*  And I don't know what's going to happen here, because Sinwar has resisted all of these proposals [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  since November of last year. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=275.92s)]
*  And we'll see what comes of it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=278.0s)]
*  There is some kind of temporary ceasefire, Brian, that get as many of these hostages out. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=280.08s)]
*  Now, the number is a max of 33, because Hamas has told them they don't believe they have [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=285.28s)]
*  any more than 33. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=291.08s)]
*  They could be lying, obviously, about all of that, because they took the hostages right [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=292.4s)]
*  from the beginning for two reasons. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=297.2s)]
*  One is to protect themselves, the leaders, and two, and use them as leverage to end the war. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=299.8s)]
*  And I don't think any of that has changed. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=304.84s)]
*  If you leave Sinwar in power, and you leave the higher-ups in Hamas in power, we're going [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=306.76s)]
*  to be back here in 18 months. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=310.76s)]
*  They're going to pull off another attack. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=312.08s)]
*  And I would hope at some level the administration understands it's in the world's best interest [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  for them to finish the job, even if there is a pause. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=319.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it seems to be obvious, but I think people are too focused on the election. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=322.24s)]
*  General Jack Keene, always great. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=327.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=328.56s)]
*  Yeah, have a great weekend, guys. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J7a89LVTFvk&t=329.56s)]
