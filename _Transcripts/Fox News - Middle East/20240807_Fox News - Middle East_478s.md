# We will defend Israel against terrorism: State Department spokesperson
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts)
*  All right, we are just getting word right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=0.0s)]
*  In the past 24 hours, U.S. Central Command forces successfully destroyed an Iranian-backed [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=3.0s)]
*  Houthi uncrewed aerial vehicle and two Iranian-backed Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles launched [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=8.56s)]
*  from Houthi-controlled areas, presumably in Yemen, over the Red Sea. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=14.72s)]
*  We don't know much more than that. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=19.28s)]
*  Of course, we have been looking for these various Iranian proxies, response to Israeli [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=20.72s)]
*  attacks and taking out key top Hezbollah and Hamas officials, in the case of the Hamas [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=25.54s)]
*  official in Tehran itself. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=32.06s)]
*  Let's get the read on where all of this is going with Matthew Miller, the State Department [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=34.34s)]
*  spokesperson, kind enough to join us. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=37.7s)]
*  Mr. Miller, thank you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=40.5s)]
*  What are we to make of this and the fact that maybe the response won't be centralized just [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=42.18s)]
*  out of Iran, but its various proxies kind of all over the region? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=47.3s)]
*  So one of the things that we have seen really since October 7th is Iran and its proxies [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=51.82s)]
*  continuing to take various terrorist actions against the state of Israel and against the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=57.14s)]
*  people of Israel. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=61.34s)]
*  And it's something that we have defended, helped defend Israel against. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=62.34s)]
*  And at times, we, of course, have taken our own actions against proxy groups who have [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=67.3s)]
*  targeted American forces. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=71.74000000000001s)]
*  And so really since October 7th, we have made it one of our prime diplomatic purposes to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=73.26s)]
*  really try to prevent this conflict from escalating. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=81.62s)]
*  On every one of Secretary Blinken's eight trips to the region, he has focused on pushing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=84.58s)]
*  for de-escalation, pushing for steps to calm tensions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=89.42s)]
*  And obviously that has been what he has been working on with the president and what other [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=92.22s)]
*  members of the administration have been working on for the past few days, trying to send very [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=95.42s)]
*  strong messages to Iran that they should not escalate this conflict, that their proxies [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  should not escalate this conflict. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=104.18s)]
*  And of course, as we have always made clear, we will defend Israel against terrorism. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=106.38000000000001s)]
*  We will defend Israel against attacks. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=110.62s)]
*  And we are urging all parties in the region to take any steps that they can to de-escalate [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=113.06s)]
*  so this conflict doesn't spin out of control. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=118.14s)]
*  Is it escalation to you, though, sir, when we see U.S. troops who are shot at in an Iraq [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=122.46000000000001s)]
*  attack as Israel braces for this retaliation, that that might be the extent of it there, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=129.54000000000002s)]
*  forces were recently exchanging gunfire in the new Galilee region, the Northwest Galilee [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=136.82s)]
*  region, I should say, of Israel, and Hezbollah firing a series of drones itself back and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  forth between Israel and Lebanon. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=149.38s)]
*  I'm just wondering, is it your sense that everyone waiting for a big central attack [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=152.38s)]
*  out of Iran, this is what it's going to be? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=158.7s)]
*  So let me say, first of all, when it comes to attacks on U.S. forces, U.S. interests, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=163.14s)]
*  U.S. personnel, we have always made clear we will defend our troops in the region, we [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  will defend our interests in the region, and we will hold parties accountable who threaten [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=171.7s)]
*  our personnel. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=175.7s)]
*  And that continues to be the case. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=176.7s)]
*  When it comes to some of these other attacks from proxy groups including— [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=178.16s)]
*  Well, did you do that in the case—I'm sorry, sir, just to be clear, did you do that in [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=180.94s)]
*  the case of these U.S. troops who were shot in Iraq? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=183.5s)]
*  What was the response to that? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=186.7s)]
*  So if you're talking about something that happened 24 hours ago, it's something that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=188.85999999999999s)]
*  just happened, and we will—we're never going to announce any actions that we take [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=192.06s)]
*  in advance, but I think if you look at our track record over the past nine months as [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=195.38s)]
*  well as our track record throughout the three and a half years of this administration, we [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=199.5s)]
*  have made clear that we will defend our personnel and we will hold people accountable. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=202.62s)]
*  And of course, we look to the government of Iraq to hold people accountable as well for [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=205.82s)]
*  actions that are taken on Iraqi soil. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=209.78s)]
*  With respect to the attacks from Hezbollah, so obviously there have been attacks from [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah against Israel since October 8th. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=217.6s)]
*  Obviously there have been attacks before that, but with respect to this conflict, since the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=220.06s)]
*  day after October 7th, Hezbollah started launching attacks at Israel and we've seen Israel taking [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=223.61999999999998s)]
*  attacks against Hezbollah. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=228.22s)]
*  We want to see those ultimately come to an end because there are tens of thousands of [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=230.94s)]
*  Israelis who can't return to their homes in northern Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=234.72s)]
*  There are tens of thousands of Lebanese who can't return to their homes in southern Lebanon. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=237.42s)]
*  And so we have been pursuing diplomacy to try to end those attacks, but of course, it's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=241.73999999999998s)]
*  been very difficult to do that while the conflict in Gaza continues to rage on. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=247.5s)]
*  So that's been part of our strategy all along in pursuing the ceasefires, not just to get [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=253.82s)]
*  a ceasefire in Gaza, but also to stop those attacks across the blue line between Israel [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  and Lebanon. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=262.5s)]
*  Now that said, the attacks that we've seen in the last few days have really been consistent [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=263.5s)]
*  with the attacks that we've seen since October 7th. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=267.5s)]
*  They go up at times, they come down at times, but not at the level that, you know, like [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=270.58s)]
*  I think you were asking about, like we are, like some have said, we could expect to see [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=276.02s)]
*  from Iran, Iran's proxy groups, all of which, as I said in response, I think, to your opening [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=280.42s)]
*  question, we are trying to prevent from happening. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=285.54s)]
*  And that's been the purpose and the goal of our diplomacy over the past few days. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=288.26s)]
*  So I take it from what you said. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=292.82s)]
*  I don't want to put words in your mouth, but attack on U.S. soldiers in Iraq over the past [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=293.82s)]
*  24 hours. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=298.22s)]
*  And if it did indeed come from Iran, you would respond directly to Iran? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=299.22s)]
*  Look, I'm just never going to preview actions that the United States is going to take. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=303.98s)]
*  As I said, when actions happen on Iraqi soil, we look first to the government of Iraq to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=308.02s)]
*  take action and hold people accountable. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=313.42s)]
*  Our troops are there at the invitation of the government of Iraq. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=315.18s)]
*  But as we have shown in previous cases, we won't hesitate to defend our troops and take [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=318.94s)]
*  our own accountability measures, our own steps to hold terrorist groups accountable if we [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=322.54s)]
*  don't see appropriate actions from the government of Iraq. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=327.26s)]
*  I understand what you can't share, Matthew, but one of the other reports we hear is that [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=330.53999999999996s)]
*  the U.S. was not given much of a heads up, if at all, in the case of some of these efforts [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  on the part of Israel to take out a key Hezbollah leader and then a key Hamas leader, that there [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=339.5s)]
*  was concern in Israel that that word would get out, that the trust or the relationship [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=345.06s)]
*  between the United States and Israel is such that you're on a need-to-know basis. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=349.94s)]
*  Israel sometimes seems to be saying you don't need to know, at least not that early. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=356.98s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, it certainly is true that we weren't aware of these attacks. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=361.58000000000004s)]
*  We weren't involved in these attacks. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=366.54s)]
*  I will say when it comes to our relationship with the government of Israel, obviously it's [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=368.46000000000004s)]
*  a very close working relationship. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=372.70000000000005s)]
*  We share information with them. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=374.3s)]
*  They share information with us, which is not to say that they agree with everything that [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=376.5s)]
*  we say and everything that we do or that we agree with everything that they say and everything [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=381.3s)]
*  I don't think there's a country in the world where we have perfect 100 percent alignment [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=386.94s)]
*  on every issue. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=390.34s)]
*  But when it comes to the working relationship with the government of Israel, I think what [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=392.14s)]
*  you've seen over the past nine months, more than nine months now since the October 7th [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=395.06s)]
*  attacks is we strongly support Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=400.02s)]
*  We strongly support Israel's right to ensure that October 7th never happens again. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=403.02s)]
*  But we have been pushing all the parties in the region to take key steps to de-escalate [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=407.9s)]
*  the conflict and really not to keep it from spinning out of control. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  It is in our judgment not in anybody's interest to see this conflict continue to escalate. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=416.7s)]
*  It's not in Israel's interest. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=421.62s)]
*  It's not in the interest of the Palestinian people. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=423.14s)]
*  It's not in the interest of anyone in the region that we see this conflict expand, that [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  we see it widen. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=428.94s)]
*  And so what we are trying to do is break this cycle of violence, break this cycle of conflict [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=430.38s)]
*  that continues to threaten the peace and the stability of everyone throughout the Middle [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=435.06s)]
*  East. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=439.62s)]
*  Of course, Israel wasn't the one who spread this conflict out with these. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=440.62s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=445.9s)]
*  Terrorist attacks, right? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=446.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=447.9s)]
*  Which is why we have continued to support their right to hold Hamas accountable and [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=448.9s)]
*  to take the fight to Hamas and to bring Hamas fighters to justice. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=453.41999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8YmME-MKtts&t=457.09999999999997s)]
