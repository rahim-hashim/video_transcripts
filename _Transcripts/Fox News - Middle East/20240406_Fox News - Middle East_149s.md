# Biden demands cease-fire in Gaza without calling for Hamas to release hostages: Tomlinson
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo)
*  Tonight, the White House is defending Biden's calls for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=0.0s)]
*  nearly six months to the day since Hamas attacked Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=4.8s)]
*  We're bringing you this now with Fox News correspondent Lucas Tomlinson live at the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=8.08s)]
*  White House tonight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=11.48s)]
*  Lucas, to you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=12.48s)]
*  That's right, Molly. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=14.32s)]
*  President Biden demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza without calling on Hamas to release [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=15.32s)]
*  the more than 100 hostages, including Americans. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=19.76s)]
*  They still have incitivity. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=22.86s)]
*  Did you threaten to stop military aid to Israel? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=23.86s)]
*  I asked them to do what they're doing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=25.86s)]
*  You need them already. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=31.86s)]
*  You need the hostages. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=34.86s)]
*  Are you abandoning Israel? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=37.86s)]
*  Are you abandoning Israel? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=40.86s)]
*  John Kirby was later pressed by our own Martha McCallum. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=49.86s)]
*  We want to get that ceasefire in place, temporary, six weeks or so, to get those hostages out, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=54.28s)]
*  get more humanitarian assistance in. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=58.9s)]
*  Hamas started this war. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=61.64s)]
*  They did indeed. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=62.64s)]
*  They crossed the border. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=63.64s)]
*  They slaughtered families and children. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=65.76s)]
*  None of this would be happening if it weren't for what happened on October the 7th. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=68.52s)]
*  Hamas started this war, as you said. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=72.56s)]
*  No question about that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=74.64s)]
*  This conflict wouldn't exist without Mr. Sinwar's decision to violate that ceasefire. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=76.08s)]
*  But what we've also said is that Israel, in addition to having the obligation to go eliminate [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=80.12s)]
*  that threat, they also have an obligation to do everything possible to protect civilians [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=85.48s)]
*  and to allow humanitarian assistance. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=89.76s)]
*  And we just haven't seen them meet those obligations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=91.80000000000001s)]
*  Now, Molly, a short time ago, we've learned from some reporters traveling with President [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=94.92s)]
*  Biden in Wilmington this weekend that for the first time since the Hamas massacre, there [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=101.28s)]
*  are protesters that were seen outside the president's home. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  And I'm sure we have some video of that. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=108.60000000000001s)]
*  We can pull up. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  But the president's motorcade had to make an alternate route, divert to church, to take [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=111.96000000000001s)]
*  the president's church. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=116.4s)]
*  You can see the motorcade here had to take a longer route because of the protesters. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=117.4s)]
*  A reporter traveling with the president later said that a protester was seen pouring fake [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=121.72s)]
*  blood outside the president's motorcade when he was pulling back into his home. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  And we're also, you can see some of the signs here, Genocide Joe, the number of protesters [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  out there today. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=136.52s)]
*  This is the first time these protesters have showed up outside the president's home in [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=137.52s)]
*  Wilmington. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Molly? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I've seen the Genocide Joe, those posters at a number of protests. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson from the White House, thank you. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTDB8O2eAxo&t=146.44s)]
