# BREAKING: Trump responds to Israel's strikes against Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM)
*  Yeah, so the topic clearly on the left, whatever it is, it can be the riots in Los Angeles, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=0.0s)]
*  or it can be Israel attacking Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=4.84s)]
*  It's always kind of going back to Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=8.3s)]
*  On that note, let's bring back in the chief political anchor, Brett Baier. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=10.26s)]
*  He joins us by phone. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=13.52s)]
*  He just happened to speak with the president of the United States, Donald Trump. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=14.98s)]
*  Brett, what did he tell you? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=18.38s)]
*  Hey, Trace. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=20.1s)]
*  Yeah, I just spoke to President Trump. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=21.1s)]
*  One thing, the president was aware of Israel's action before it happened. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=24.78s)]
*  There were no surprises here. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=30.98s)]
*  But he gave me a quote. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=33.260000000000005s)]
*  He said, Iran cannot have a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=34.86s)]
*  We'll get back to the negotiating table. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=37.58s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=40.38s)]
*  There are several people in leadership in Iran that will not be coming back. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  Now, the president, I know, has spoken to Prime Minister Netanyahu several times in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=46.3s)]
*  recent days. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=51.94s)]
*  As I mentioned before, the Trump administration reached out to a key Middle Eastern ally [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=54.38s)]
*  beforehand to acknowledge this strike was going to happen, but that the U.S. was not [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=59.14s)]
*  involved in the strike, but the goal still to get Iran back to the negotiating table. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  There was this building frustration about what Iran was doing at that negotiating table [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  with Steve Witkoff, the Middle East envoy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=75.42s)]
*  He was scheduled again for Sunday. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=78.26s)]
*  Obviously, that may change the dynamic there, whether that moves forward at all depends [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=81.9s)]
*  on what Iran does in response. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=86.98s)]
*  The president told me he's looking to see what the retaliation may be. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  CENTCOM is on high alert. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=97.02000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. will defend, will help defend Israel if needed. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=98.94s)]
*  As I mentioned in the last time we talked, the Iron Dome has been replenished in Israel [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=107.26s)]
*  in recent weeks. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=114.1s)]
*  So there's still this hope in the president's sense and the people around him that this [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=115.7s)]
*  changes the dynamic for Iran and that this does not launch into what will be a back and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=122.9s)]
*  forth. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=129.86s)]
*  We just saw the post from the supreme leader saying that this is the beginning of a major, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=131.14000000000001s)]
*  major retaliation and that Israel, in his words, has sealed its fate. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=138.9s)]
*  U.S. officials are confirming to us that a number of top Iranian officials, leaders are [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  dead after these strikes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=151.22s)]
*  But as far as the full sense of what the targeting looked like, Natanz, the nuclear facility [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=153.86s)]
*  was struck, but we don't believe it was by the biggest of the penetrating bombs, but [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=161.02s)]
*  we will have to see come first light. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=168.38000000000002s)]
*  And the U.S. military, and we've been saying this, was not directly involved in these strikes, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=171.02s)]
*  but there clearly was an advanced knowledge and communication and knowledge of what was [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  happening. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=183.9s)]
*  And now we'll see exactly what the retaliation looks like. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  Great reporting as always. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=190.26s)]
*  Brett Baer, the chief political anchor, live for us on the phone. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=191.26s)]
*  Brett, if you get more information, we'll bring you back in. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppy6l7ojEVM&t=194.7s)]
