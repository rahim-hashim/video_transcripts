# Israel prepares for ground invasion amid anti-tank incident near Lebanon border
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8)
*  A Fox News alert. A ground invasion into Gaza could be imminent with Israeli tanks and troops [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=0.0s)]
*  massing along the border. And from the sky, hundreds of bombs rain down on Gaza as Israel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=6.58s)]
*  releases all restraints on its military. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=12.44s)]
*  You are watching Fox and Friends First on this Wednesday morning. I'm Carly Schimges. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=28.64s)]
*  And I'm Todd Pyro, the Gaza Strip on the brink of a full-blown humanitarian crisis with the [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=31.92s)]
*  power expected to go out in the coming hours. Its access to food, fuel, and medicine has [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=36.96s)]
*  already been cut off. The first plane of carrying US ammo arriving in Israel overnight as our [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=42.8s)]
*  ally looks to get Hamas out of Gaza for good. Trey Yanks live along the Israel-Gaza border [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=48.68s)]
*  with the very latest. Trey. Todd, Carly, good morning. Right now we are along the Israel-Gaza [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=55.36s)]
*  border watching as the Israeli artillery units are working. You can hear that boom behind me. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=62.56s)]
*  They're trying to hit the eastern part of the Gaza Strip and clear a path for what is expected to be [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=68.72s)]
*  a massive ground invasion in the coming days. Thousands of troops are staging here along the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=73.76s)]
*  border. These artillery units working from this side, the Israeli Navy working from the other, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=78.72s)]
*  and the Air Force striking targets overnight in a variety of neighborhoods in the northern and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=83.6s)]
*  eastern part of the Gaza Strip. This is coming though as we're getting some breaking news out [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=88.32s)]
*  of northern Israel along the border with Lebanon, where the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=92.96s)]
*  appears to have fired an anti-tank missile at a group of Israeli soldiers. We don't have much [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=98.56s)]
*  more information about what's taken place other than there's been an incident on the border, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=104.0s)]
*  and some of that information is under censorship from the Israeli military. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=109.12s)]
*  As this story moves forward, a lot of things are happening and there are a lot of numbers that are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=113.28s)]
*  going to change. The latest death toll that we have from southern Israel though following that [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=118.48s)]
*  massacre on Saturday morning is 1200 people. I do want to show you the scene behind me here [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  with these artillery units as they're preparing to strike more of the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=129.04000000000002s)]
*  These are going to be critical units as support because when these soldiers move in, there are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=134.32000000000002s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad militants that use these border communities as a place to engage the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  Israeli troops in urban battle. You're going to hear an explosion here as they're firing in the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=145.68s)]
*  distance. I'm going to have my cameraman pan over. You see that white smoke coming up and you might [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  see another outgoing shell here, but this is the situation along the border. Constant fire back [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=156.88000000000002s)]
*  and forth. There have been rocket barrages into the community just next to here, a town called [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=162.96s)]
*  Sderot where another massacre took place, and we do expect this type of fire to continue throughout [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=167.68s)]
*  the day here along the Israel-Gaza border. Hey, Tre, how big of a deal is that breaking [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=173.68s)]
*  news that you just mentioned that Lebanon fired the anti-tank missile into Israel and also there's [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=179.28s)]
*  been action in Syria as well. What's the significance of that? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=184.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. Yesterday there were mortar shells fired into Israeli territory from Syria, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=188.23999999999998s)]
*  and the Israelis responded immediately with artillery strikes using units just like the ones [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=195.12s)]
*  behind me. But when you look at what's happening here, slowly but surely a multi-front conflict is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  opening up against the Jewish state. It is a conflict that has been discussed for years. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=205.76s)]
*  The Israelis have touted how they would respond. They say they would respond to the Israeli [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=210.72s)]
*  intelligence. They have the soldiers to do it, but it was a nightmare scenario, a scenario that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=215.68s)]
*  no one really thought was the most likely outcome given the situation across the region. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=220.48000000000002s)]
*  But today we understand that is what Israel is facing and the trickle effect of the attacks in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  the north and the northeast of the country. Just a reminder that Israeli forces are not going to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  just be spread out here along the Gaza border, but also need to have tanks, APCs and ground troops [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=236.0s)]
*  there in the north. Todd Carley? Underscoring the need for every single one of those 360,000 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  troops, many of whom were called up from reserves, many of those from other countries around the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=249.28s)]
*  world. Trey, one more question for you. You mentioned the shells that are being fired in [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=255.11999999999998s)]
*  the shot behind you. What is the range of those? In other words, you're close to where they are [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=258.64s)]
*  being fired from. How far away from you are they landing? Approximately. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=263.52s)]
*  Approximately two miles from where we are right now. They're firing into the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=269.12s)]
*  You can hear those explosions. I'm just going to step out of the way here so my cameraman can [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=274.96s)]
*  pan in here. But it's approximately two miles. It depends what neighborhood exactly these units [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=280.0s)]
*  are hitting overnight. We do understand they were targeting Sajaya and Al-Fatun, two neighborhoods [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=285.76s)]
*  that are traditionally used in the Gaza Strip. And the other two are in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=291.68s)]
*  The Gaza Strip is traditionally used by these militants to fire from. But again, it's a very [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=298.08s)]
*  densely populated area, so there are also hundreds of thousands of civilians in these neighborhoods, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=304.32s)]
*  which makes it difficult to be accurate with all of the strikes and all of the artillery. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=309.2s)]
*  We do understand the death toll inside Gaza is rising. You might have seen that black smoke on [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  the horizon. That's actually coming from inside the Gaza Strip. The death toll, though, in Gaza, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=319.2s)]
*  people. We understand more than 4,000 injured and reports from inside Gaza City at Al-Shifa [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=324.72s)]
*  Hospital, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, describe scenes of the morgue being [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=330.16s)]
*  overwhelmed, not enough medicine and aid. And countries in the region say that they would like [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=334.8s)]
*  to supply aid to Gaza. That includes Egypt and Jordan. The Israelis say that is not possible, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=340.88000000000005s)]
*  that the Gaza Strip is under siege following that massacre on Saturday morning. And they say they [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  will even hit Egyptian convoys if they try to deliver aid to the enclave. Todd, Carly? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=351.84s)]
*  Unreal. They are not messing around. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=358.23999999999995s)]
*  And all this is happening even before the ground invasion begins. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=359.84s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much for joining us this morning. We'll check back in with you very soon. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4SPv97H4v8&t=362.79999999999995s)]
