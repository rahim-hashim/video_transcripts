# Pentagon: US not in Iraq, Syria for a 'full scale war'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A)
*  Their North Common NORAD are central to our strong military and ability to defend the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=0.0s)]
*  homeland, whether it's joint training, education, humanitarian assistance, disaster response, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  maritime domain awareness, or cyber defense. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=9.84s)]
*  The North Common NORAD Unified Command enhances our common security and deepens our ties [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=12.56s)]
*  to our closest neighbors. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=17.2s)]
*  Also, U.S. Space Command will host the Global Sentinel annual two-week capstone event starting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=18.96s)]
*  today through February 16 at Vandenberg Space Force Base, California. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=23.84s)]
*  The Global Sentinel is U.S. Space Command's premier security cooperation effort designed [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=28.28s)]
*  to strengthen and grow international partnerships, improve operational collaboration, and promote [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=32.88s)]
*  responsible behavior in the space domain. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=37.84s)]
*  Space operators from 25 nations around the world will collaborate during the two weeks [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=40.96s)]
*  with each participating nation embedded in a regional space operations center while maintaining [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  national command and control of their sensors for planning, tasking, and analysis. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=50.56s)]
*  For questions on the exercise, I'd refer you to U.S. Space Command Public Affairs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=56.0s)]
*  And finally, February marks the beginning of Black History Month, which provides a unique [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=60.44s)]
*  opportunity for the Department, our service members, and our nation to celebrate the contributions, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=64.24s)]
*  achievements, and brave service of black Americans. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Our military and civilian workforce is strong, diverse, and always ready to defend our nation, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=72.32s)]
*  our allies, and our interests against modern threats. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=76.48s)]
*  This month and throughout the year, we will reflect upon and honor the service and sacrifice [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  of black Americans who continue to lead, impact, and shape our nation's rich history [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=83.88s)]
*  and future. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=88.72s)]
*  And that'll be glad to take your questions. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=89.72s)]
*  We'll go to Associated Press' Lita Beldor. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=91.6s)]
*  Thank you, Pat. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=93.84s)]
*  It's been three days since the strikes on Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=95.64s)]
*  Can you at least give us some general assessment as to whether there were indications that [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=99.52s)]
*  there were enemy combatants at those sites that could have been killed or injured? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=105.64s)]
*  There's got to be at least some sort of at least initial assessment that says there were [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  people at those places or there weren't. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=114.56s)]
*  And then just secondarily, I think Jake Sullivan yesterday talked about seen and unseen U.S. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=117.48s)]
*  military responses to the U.S. responses to these ongoing attacks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=124.88s)]
*  Can you say whether or not any of the unseen responses have already occurred? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=130.76s)]
*  Thanks, Lita. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=135.68s)]
*  On your first question, I don't want to get ahead of Central Command's assessment. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=137.28s)]
*  I think it is fair to conclude that there likely were casualties associated with these [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=140.12s)]
*  strikes. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=145.28s)]
*  But to ensure that we're providing accurate information, we need to allow time for Central [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=146.92000000000002s)]
*  Command to continue to conduct its assessment. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  And certainly we'll keep you updated as we have new information to provide on that front. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=153.88s)]
*  As it relates to actions that we're taking, again, I'm not going to have anything to provide [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=159.8s)]
*  for you beyond what we put out in our statements. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  And then any of these attempts to get HVTs in any of those locations that you think may [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=167.56s)]
*  or may not have been successful? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=173.6s)]
*  Lita, what I would tell you is that what we put out in our press releases is what I have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=175.6s)]
*  to provide on that front. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=181.76s)]
*  Jen. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=183.23999999999998s)]
*  Pat, there have been three attacks by Iranian proxy forces in Syria since Friday. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=184.23999999999998s)]
*  You say that the assessment is that the strikes on Friday night had good effects. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=189.92s)]
*  How can you say that when there's three more attacks? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=196.56s)]
*  What will the response be? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=199.27999999999997s)]
*  And are the troops at those bases, those outposts, allowed to leave the base and to pursue those [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=201.11999999999998s)]
*  who are firing rockets and drones at the bases? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=208.79999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so a couple things, Jennifer. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  So first of all, on your last comment, our forces will always maintain the inherent right [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  of self-defense. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=219.64s)]
*  So if they need to take appropriate actions to defend themselves, they will, and you've [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=220.64s)]
*  seen us do that in the past. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=224.23999999999998s)]
*  In terms of attacks in Iraq and Syria since we took these strikes on Friday, I'm actually [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  only tracking two incidents. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=231.55999999999997s)]
*  There was one attack on Saturday, February the 3rd. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=234.23999999999998s)]
*  That was two rockets that were fired at MSS Euphrates in Syria with no injuries or damage [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  reported. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=245.39999999999998s)]
*  And then I'm aware of one yesterday, February 4th. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=246.96s)]
*  This was a one-way attack drone that landed several kilometers from MSS Green Village. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=249.88000000000002s)]
*  Also in Syria, again, no reported U.S. injuries or damage to those facilities. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=256.88s)]
*  Again, the strikes that we took on Friday were in response, as I highlighted in my topper, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=261.76s)]
*  to the attacks on U.S. forces at Jordan. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=268.44s)]
*  And again, we'll take necessary action to defend our forces. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=271.32s)]
*  But, Pat, I believe that there was a third strike that killed six SDF Kurdish fighters. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=274.6s)]
*  I think the one you're referring to is the latter one that I highlighted, and I am aware [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=279.92s)]
*  of those reports of Syria Democratic forces killed in that strike, but I'd have to refer [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  you to them to talk about that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  But it was not on a base where U.S. forces were. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=293.48s)]
*  It was in the vicinity of Green Village. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=295.36s)]
*  Let me go to Dan. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=298.0s)]
*  I'll come to Carla. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=299.48s)]
*  Could you tell us, in the Red Sea, does Iran continue to supply weapons and intelligence [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=301.24s)]
*  to the Houthi forces in Yemen? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=308.98s)]
*  So Dan, I don't have any specific intelligence to read out to you here, nor would I, other [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=311.72s)]
*  than to say that we know that Iran, of course, provides resources to the Houthis to include [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=316.90000000000003s)]
*  training, funding, equipment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=325.16s)]
*  And so, again, and they're not the only ones, right? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=327.96s)]
*  I mean, they have proxies throughout the Middle East. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=331.64s)]
*  So again, we recognize that, and we're going to continue to call on Iran to cease supporting [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=334.35999999999996s)]
*  these types of actions that we're seeing from proxies. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=341.02s)]
*  And again, we'll continue to take appropriate action to protect our forces. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=345.03999999999996s)]
*  There is a ship called the Bishan. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=349.0s)]
*  I'm sure you've heard of it, in the Red Sea. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=350.44s)]
*  issued a warning saying the U.S. should not target this ship. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=353.24s)]
*  They claim it's a counter-piracy mission ship, but it's widely believed that it's actually [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=358.76s)]
*  a spy ship, effectively providing electronic intelligence to the Houthis to help them spot [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=364.28000000000003s)]
*  targets. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=369.6s)]
*  Is that a target that's off limits? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=371.48s)]
*  So first of all, I'm not aware of the U.S. targeting the Bishad. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=374.48s)]
*  We are very well aware of the Bishad. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=377.66s)]
*  As you've heard NavSent talk about before, it's pretty standard for Iran to have a ship [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=379.88s)]
*  in the Red Sea conducting operations, as you've highlighted, so that in and of itself is not [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=385.53999999999996s)]
*  unusual. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=391.56s)]
*  And again, so we're there, again, to support freedom of navigation, to work with the international [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=392.56s)]
*  community to ensure that vessels can safely transit this waterway. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=398.55999999999995s)]
*  We are not there to seek confrontation or war with Iran. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=404.26s)]
*  But if our forces are threatened, we will take appropriate action. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=407.14s)]
*  I'm sorry, let me go to Karla and I'll come to you, Tom. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=409.62s)]
*  A few follow-ups. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=412.06s)]
*  I am aware of a single rocket attack that happened today in Syria, MSS Euphrates. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=413.46s)]
*  If you could take that to confirm that to us following this briefing, I would greatly [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=420.78s)]
*  appreciate it. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=425.21999999999997s)]
*  I want to follow up on Jen's question about the attack at Omar Oil Field. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=426.74s)]
*  How close were U.S. forces? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=432.78s)]
*  Were there any U.S. forces that were with the SDF when they came under attack? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=434.54s)]
*  Yeah, I think I answered that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=439.62s)]
*  So I'm not aware of any U.S. forces that were with the SDF at the time. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=441.22s)]
*  And this was this one-way attack drone landed several kilometers from Green Village. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=454.26s)]
*  And then is it safe to say that at this point no militant commanders were killed in any [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=455.26s)]
*  of the strikes over the weekend in Iraq and Syria? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=460.1s)]
*  I know you're still doing an assessment, but kind of follow-up. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=463.14s)]
*  Yeah, so Karla, again, I don't have any information to corroborate that, but again, we're continuing [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=466.14s)]
*  to assess. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=470.7s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=471.7s)]
*  And then finally, with the two self-defense strikes that happened in Yemen where there [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=472.7s)]
*  were anti-ship missiles ready to launch with the three attacks or two attacks, clearing [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=477.97999999999996s)]
*  that up, in Syria since the attacks in Iraq and Syria that the U.S. conducted. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=482.82s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=487.41999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, that's a lot. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=488.41999999999996s)]
*  You're crossing streams here. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=489.41999999999996s)]
*  That's five attacks. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=490.41999999999996s)]
*  Are you talking about Iraq and Syria or Yemen? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=491.5s)]
*  All of them. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=493.7s)]
*  Is it safe to say that deterrence against Iranian-backed proxies in Yemen and Iraq and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=494.7s)]
*  Syria is not working at this point because there were two rounds of strikes and both [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=499.46000000000004s)]
*  of those proxy sets are still striking American forces or still trying to strike American [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=504.42s)]
*  forces and international shipping lines? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=513.1800000000001s)]
*  So as it relates to Iraq and Syria, again, I'll just take it, allow me to take a step [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=514.1800000000001s)]
*  back here. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=520.18s)]
*  Again, our forces are there to conduct the Defeat ISIS mission. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=521.18s)]
*  If our forces are attacked, and in this case, when our forces were killed, we will take [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=525.66s)]
*  appropriate and necessary action. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=532.46s)]
*  And as I highlighted in my topper, our responses are not complete. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=534.66s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to telegraph or discuss what that may be, other than we'll conduct [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=540.14s)]
*  that at a time and place of our choosing. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=546.18s)]
*  That is our focus. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=548.9s)]
*  When it comes to the Red Sea, our focus is on working with international allies and partners [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=550.3000000000001s)]
*  to ensure that mariners can transit the Red Sea safely. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=554.86s)]
*  Our focus when it comes to striking Houthi targets is to disrupt and degrade their capabilities. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=558.54s)]
*  We don't seek an escalation with the Houthis. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=564.54s)]
*  We're not at war with the Houthis. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=566.5s)]
*  We're not seeking to go to war with the Houthis. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=567.5s)]
*  But if they continue the attacks, we will continue to disrupt and degrade their capabilities. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=570.04s)]
*  So they have capability. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=575.34s)]
*  It would not be surprising to anyone if they attempt to conduct attacks in the future. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=578.38s)]
*  But when they do, again, we'll take appropriate action, as we have been doing. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=582.26s)]
*  And when we see an imminent threat to mariners, we will also take appropriate action, as in [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=585.82s)]
*  the case of the self-defense strikes. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=589.26s)]
*  Let me go to Tom, then I'll come. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=590.7s)]
*  I need to get to some other questions. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=592.74s)]
*  You hit 13 locations, 36 targets. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=595.06s)]
*  Five hours later, the Houthis fired a missile, and then more followed the following day. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=598.58s)]
*  So what does that say about the effectiveness of U.S. strikes? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=602.3s)]
*  And what are the consequences? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=606.5s)]
*  Because they're already firing after your efforts. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=607.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=610.18s)]
*  Well, the Houthis live in the same physical plane that we do, and they have a finite amount [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=611.18s)]
*  of capability. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=615.02s)]
*  And the question is, how much of that capability do they want to sacrifice to a doomed cause? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=616.02s)]
*  Because again, we'll continue to diminish and disrupt that capability in the sake of [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=622.86s)]
*  working with international allies and partners to ensure that mariners can safely transit. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=628.3s)]
*  It's a doomed cause because they're still striking. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=632.78s)]
*  Well, I'll leave that to the Houthis to address. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=635.6199999999999s)]
*  But again, they do have a finite amount of capability, and how much do they want to continue [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=638.26s)]
*  to sacrifice that capability for the sake of achieving something which ultimately will fail? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=644.6199999999999s)]
*  Let me go to Missy. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=651.42s)]
*  Hi. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=652.9799999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Pat. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=653.9799999999999s)]
*  I have two process requests and then a question. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=654.9799999999999s)]
*  On the process, is it possible to – you know, CENTCOM has been putting out the report [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=656.66s)]
*  that Houthi attacks when they do their – but we haven't got – unless I'm missing it, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=663.38s)]
*  we're not getting the same for the Iraq-Syria requests regularly. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=667.78s)]
*  Excuse me, attacks by militants and American personnel or facilities in Iraq and Syria. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=670.9s)]
*  It would be great if we could get the same on that. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=677.54s)]
*  And also just a request again to see if we can get on the strikes on Yemen and then on [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=680.02s)]
*  Iraq and Syria, just get in the vicinity of locations because that makes it a lot easier [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=686.66s)]
*  for us to cross-check stuff that we're hearing from the region. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=692.38s)]
*  And then my question for you is, can you talk a little bit about how the department is seeing [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=695.38s)]
*  the fact that, you know, you're conducting these strikes in Iraq and Syria against these [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=703.74s)]
*  – Iranian-linked militants, but those militants are on the payroll of the Iraqi government. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=709.98s)]
*  How are you guys approaching that fact they're officially part of Iraqi security forces? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=716.98s)]
*  Some of the sites that you're hitting are described as joint facilities that are used [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=724.74s)]
*  by these – officially, again, part of the Iraqi security forces. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=731.54s)]
*  How are you all thinking about that? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=736.4200000000001s)]
*  And what's the dialogue with the Iraqi government about that? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=738.66s)]
*  Obviously, they've made their unhappiness known. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=741.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=744.0200000000001s)]
*  So, you know, recognizing some of what you have probably seen in regional reporting and [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=745.3800000000001s)]
*  social media, what I would tell you is that as we conduct these strikes, we are very focused [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=753.94s)]
*  on Iranian-backed proxy groups and not PMF. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=759.3800000000001s)]
*  Again, that is our focus. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=764.9000000000001s)]
*  It's not on striking ISF or Iraqi security forces or personnel that are part of the legitimate [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=768.02s)]
*  Iraqi security forces. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=777.86s)]
*  So that includes groups like Qatab Hezbollah, Han, which we've talked about, and again, [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=780.98s)]
*  folks – or militants that are associated with the IRGC. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=787.54s)]
*  And so as we conduct our planning and our targeting and our operations, it is very deliberate [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=791.06s)]
*  and it is very carefully calculated to strike those capabilities. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=797.1800000000001s)]
*  What was the second part of your question? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=801.9s)]
*  That was just a question. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=803.66s)]
*  How do you draw that line? [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=804.46s)]
*  Because my understanding is that at least a good part of those groups are part of the [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=805.66s)]
*  PMF, which is officially now part of the Iraqi government. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=811.26s)]
*  Again, we're striking terrorist groups that are supported by the IRGC. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=814.0600000000001s)]
*  That doesn't make sense, Patrick. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=820.94s)]
*  Which I think also are part of the PMF, though. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=823.02s)]
*  Again, I'm going to – [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=826.46s)]
*  You're saying that there are people who have high-level positions in the Iraqi government [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=828.46s)]
*  who are designated terrorists. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=832.38s)]
*  I just – [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=834.14s)]
*  As I understand it, the folks that we're striking are not part of the PMF. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=834.78s)]
*  So can I just follow up on what he's asking? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=839.82s)]
*  Because the prime minister of Iraq went to visit wounded militants who were injured in [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=842.54s)]
*  attacks by the U.S. military and they were part of the PMF. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=850.62s)]
*  Or if that was not the case, that's what the statement from the Iraqi government was, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=855.9s)]
*  if they were not, he was visiting what you're calling sort of Iranian proxies that are – [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=860.14s)]
*  Yeah, I can't speak to the Iraqi minister of defense. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=866.86s)]
*  Again, we've been very clear in terms of what we're – the groups that we're targeting [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=871.42s)]
*  and the capabilities that we're targeting that are associated with the IRGC and Iranian-backed [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=876.62s)]
*  proxies who are facilitating and conducting attacks on U.S. forces, and that is our focus. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=882.54s)]
*  Obviously, when it comes to the Iraqis and Iraqi security forces and the Iraqi government, [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=888.0600000000001s)]
*  Iraq is a valued partner. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=893.02s)]
*  We continue to work closely with Iraq on counterterrorism efforts, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=894.7s)]
*  and I'll just leave it at that. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=897.98s)]
*  Tom. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=899.74s)]
*  Thanks, General. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=900.0600000000001s)]
*  Iraq is a valued partner. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=901.66s)]
*  Why didn't you tell them ahead of time that this strike was coming? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=902.78s)]
*  Has that fact strained bilateral relationships, in particular in the context of the ongoing talks? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=907.42s)]
*  And then I had a second, shorter question. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=915.26s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Tom. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=918.22s)]
*  Again, I won't speak for Iraq. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=919.42s)]
*  As I highlighted, they are a valued partner. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=920.78s)]
*  We'll continue to work closely with them, consult with them closely. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=923.26s)]
*  We have consistently communicated to the Iraqis and others that we reserve the right to defend [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=927.26s)]
*  our personnel from attacks by Iranian-backed militants in Iraq, which is what you saw on [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=932.86s)]
*  Friday. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=937.9s)]
*  And I'm sorry, your second question. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=938.22s)]
*  Yeah, just going back to Friday's strikes, I know that we were told that most of the capability [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=940.3000000000001s)]
*  came from B-1 bombs from the U.S. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=946.46s)]
*  Were there any jets launched from the Middle East? [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=949.5s)]
*  No, there were U.S. fighter aircraft that participated from within the U.S. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=954.7s)]
*  Central Command area of responsibility. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=959.34s)]
*  But for both operations security reasons and diplomatic reasons, I'm just not able to go into [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=961.98s)]
*  more detail. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=967.6600000000001s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=968.46s)]
*  Yes, sir. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=969.6600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, staying on Iraq, the Iraqi government talking about that you targeted the Iraqi [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=970.0600000000001s)]
*  security forces. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=975.4200000000001s)]
*  This is what they say. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=976.46s)]
*  So and they summoned the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad and gave a letter in protest of that attack. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=978.14s)]
*  So also they say that there were attacks on the residential buildings and citizens' property [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=985.34s)]
*  and casualties where civilians included. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=990.62s)]
*  So based on your initial assessment, how do you target any residential buildings and citizens' [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=994.0600000000001s)]
*  property and also where any civilians killed in that attacks? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1000.46s)]
*  So again, I'm not going to speak for the Iraqi government. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1005.74s)]
*  I think we've been very clear in terms of what we targeted, and these were facilities that have [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1008.3s)]
*  been used or are being used by the IRGC and affiliated militias to attack U.S. forces. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1016.62s)]
*  And I spelled out very specifically what we targeted. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1024.1399999999999s)]
*  Command and control operation centers, intelligence centers, rockets, missiles, unmanned [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1027.74s)]
*  aerial vehicle storage and logistics and munitions supply chain facilities. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1033.58s)]
*  And so again, our focus here is on attacking capability that have been used by these groups. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1039.5s)]
*  And today there were a meeting between the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1047.34s)]
*  Security, first with a delegation from Iraqi Kurdistan. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1050.86s)]
*  So have you touched that issue with them and what was the main discussion of that meeting? [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1055.1s)]
*  Yeah, I just don't have any insight to provide on that, sir. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1059.66s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1063.1s)]
*  You just touched on, but your strikes in Iraq result in anger and condemnation by the Iraqi [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1063.98s)]
*  government. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1073.5s)]
*  So the Secretary or any guys from the Department of State talk to Iraqi officials and they're [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1074.3s)]
*  your account or something like that? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1082.62s)]
*  Yeah, I can't speak for State Department. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1085.26s)]
*  I'd refer you to them. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1087.34s)]
*  Obviously, we have a U.S. embassy there. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1088.3799999999999s)]
*  I'd refer you to State to talk about that. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1091.8999999999999s)]
*  And again, look, Iraq, as I highlighted, is a valued partner. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1094.22s)]
*  Our forces have been attacked in Iraq and Syria, now Jordan, and we have been very clear that we [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1098.3799999999999s)]
*  will take necessary and appropriate action to respond and we will continue to protect [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1104.1399999999999s)]
*  our forces. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1109.6599999999999s)]
*  Let me go to the phone here. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1110.7s)]
*  J.J. Green, WTOP. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1112.62s)]
*  General, thank you for this. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1113.98s)]
*  Considering how the Houthis and the Islamic resistance umbrella groups have been responding [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1122.14s)]
*  to the strikes that the U.S. has launched in response not just to what took place in Jordan, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1129.18s)]
*  but in response to what's been happening in the Red Sea and other places, how are these [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1135.74s)]
*  continued attacks impacting the U.S. plans to launch strikes? [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1143.58s)]
*  We've been hearing that there isn't a wider conflict. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1149.02s)]
*  You don't want one, but it looks as though they're trying to push that towards, push [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1152.46s)]
*  everything towards a conflict, a wider conflict. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1158.94s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, J.J. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1162.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, I think you're right in the sense that we do see these groups attempting [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1163.26s)]
*  to exploit tensions in the Middle East to serve various ends. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1168.86s)]
*  In the case of Iraq and Syria, as I've highlighted before, we know that these groups [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1175.1s)]
*  have a stated goal of compelling the United States to leave the region. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1181.1s)]
*  Again, U.S. forces in Iraq, at the invitation of the government of Iraq and our forces in Syria, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1186.78s)]
*  both of our, you know, in both locations, were there to support the lasting defeat of ISIS, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1193.18s)]
*  and that will continue to be the focus. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1199.1000000000001s)]
*  In the Red Sea, we've seen the Houthis continue to conduct strikes against international shipping [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1201.58s)]
*  and naval vessels affecting over 50 nations, and so we have a duty to respond to that and [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1207.1000000000001s)]
*  ensure that mariners can safely transit this waterway. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1215.18s)]
*  In the name of freedom of navigation, and so again, we'll continue to stay focused on that. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1219.74s)]
*  But it should be very clear that our goal here in both situations is to ensure security and [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1225.5s)]
*  stability in those regions. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1232.3799999999999s)]
*  We're not seeking to escalate, but if our forces are threatened, as I've highlighted, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1233.58s)]
*  we will respond appropriately. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1237.98s)]
*  Let me come back into the room. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1239.4199999999998s)]
*  Ashley. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1240.78s)]
*  I wanted to follow up on the analysis into what happened at Tower 22. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1242.1399999999999s)]
*  Where does that stand? [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1246.3s)]
*  Have you identified a group? [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1247.42s)]
*  How did the drone get in? [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1249.8200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so I'd refer you to CENTCOM for any updates in terms of their review into the attack, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1252.3000000000002s)]
*  as has been highlighted. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1259.42s)]
*  We know this, according to our intelligence community, the Islamic resistance in Iraq, [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1261.18s)]
*  the umbrella group, is responsible, but again, bears the hallmarks of a group like [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1268.22s)]
*  Qataba Hezbollah, but again, that continues to be reviewed. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1275.42s)]
*  And then on the counteroffensive in Iraq and Syria right now, could you broadly lay out [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1278.14s)]
*  what are the goals and the measures of success? [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1284.7s)]
*  In terms of our response? [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1288.22s)]
*  Yeah, so our goal is to conduct the Defeat ISIS mission in a way that's safe and secure [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1289.98s)]
*  for our forces that are in the region. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1296.78s)]
*  As I've highlighted, if we continue to be attacked, we'll take appropriate action [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1299.5s)]
*  to defend our forces. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1303.74s)]
*  With the counterattacks coming back, I mean, is that success? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1306.54s)]
*  Again, you know, we're going to take necessary actions to protect our forces. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1310.7s)]
*  It's not unusual. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1314.86s)]
*  I mean, you've been following this for a very long time. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1315.98s)]
*  You know, whenever we conduct strikes, it's not unusual to see some type of immediate reaction, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1317.9s)]
*  whether it's lobbing a mortar into the air just to say they did something. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1322.7s)]
*  That said, again, it's dangerous and it's provocative and it's destabilizing. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1327.74s)]
*  So if our forces are threatened, we'll take appropriate action. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1331.9s)]
*  But to be clear, our goal is not to, okay, game on. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1335.1000000000001s)]
*  Let's just do this and go full-scale war against Iranian proxy groups in Iraq and Syria. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1338.3000000000002s)]
*  That's not what we're there for. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1345.3400000000001s)]
*  We're there to conduct the mission in support of the Defeat of ISIS. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1346.7s)]
*  Again, I've already highlighted what our focus is. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1353.3400000000001s)]
*  Lara? [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1355.74s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1356.3000000000002s)]
*  Can you please tell us, did any Iranians die in the attacks on Friday? [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1357.18s)]
*  So Lara, as I understand it, CENTCOM is continuing to assess, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1361.1000000000001s)]
*  but initial indications are we're not aware of any Iranians killed. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1365.1000000000001s)]
*  But again, we'll continue to analyze and as we have updates, we'll let you know. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1370.06s)]
*  U.S. officials have said there will be more or the response will be continuing to the [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1375.98s)]
*  attack in Jordan. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1380.54s)]
*  Are you the Pentagon planning for a long-term campaign in Iraq and Syria? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1381.82s)]
*  So no. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1386.38s)]
*  As I understand it, that's not the case. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1388.6200000000001s)]
*  But again, I'm not going to get into specifics on what future operations could look like [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1390.78s)]
*  other than to say there will be a time and place of our choosing. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1396.22s)]
*  Warren? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1399.02s)]
*  You've now conducted three joint strikes on Houthi targets with the U.K. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1400.14s)]
*  and a growing number of unilateral strikes. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1405.5s)]
*  Given that Houthi attacks continue, can you say what the assessment is on [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1407.98s)]
*  how much of their weaponry you've been able to take away at this point? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1412.86s)]
*  And then just one question. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1415.82s)]
*  CENTCOM said on Saturday or after the strikes on Yemen that they struck facilities deep [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1417.58s)]
*  underground. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1423.34s)]
*  Can you say what type of munition was used in that case and if it's the first time we've [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1423.82s)]
*  seen that? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1427.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1427.66s)]
*  Thanks, Warren. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1427.98s)]
*  On your latter question, no, I'm not going to get into the specific weaponeering for [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1429.02s)]
*  our targeting. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1433.5s)]
*  And then in terms of the degradation of capability, I don't have any statistics to [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1435.98s)]
*  pass along to you today, but certainly understand the interest in that. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1441.5s)]
*  And as we have that information to provide, we certainly will. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1445.9s)]
*  All that to say, as you highlighted, the three coalition strikes plus at this point 14 U.S. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1449.66s)]
*  unilateral strikes in self-defense all add up to what we believe is degrading a significant [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1458.22s)]
*  amount of capability, again, toward the end of disrupting and degrading their capability [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1466.38s)]
*  to conduct these kinds of attacks. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1471.9s)]
*  So let me do a couple from the phone here. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1473.66s)]
*  Howard Altman. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1475.8200000000002s)]
*  Hey, thanks, Pat. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1477.3400000000001s)]
*  Couple of things. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1478.38s)]
*  Are you tracking any civilian casualties in the strikes from Friday night? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1479.9s)]
*  And then is the U.S. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1484.38s)]
*  plussing up or adding troops to Syria from Iraq as these attacks continue? [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1486.14s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Howard. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1495.74s)]
*  I'm not aware of any – well, I don't have anything to announce in terms of force [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1496.86s)]
*  posture changes at this time. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1501.98s)]
*  And then in terms of civilian casualties, again, CENTCOM continues to assess. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1504.3799999999999s)]
*  And as we have more information to provide, we'll be sure to let you know. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1508.86s)]
*  Again, as we conducted these strikes, as always, we took significant measures to [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1512.86s)]
*  minimize or mitigate any potential civilian harm. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1520.3s)]
*  But again, as we have updates, we'll be sure to provide those. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1522.7s)]
*  Let me go to Heather, USNI. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1525.82s)]
*  Hi. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1529.66s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1529.98s)]
*  Just to follow up on the strikes on Yemen, it seems that every time that the U.S. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1531.26s)]
*  is constantly striking Yemen and then Yemen – or the Houthis then strike back on ships. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1538.14s)]
*  So is the United States having any effect on deterrence? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1544.06s)]
*  It seems like the Houthis have come out and said that they're going to continue to do [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1548.14s)]
*  this until Israel stops bombing Gaza. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1551.18s)]
*  So I guess what are the next steps here with the Houthis? [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1554.6200000000001s)]
*  Again, Heather, the focus here is on disrupting and degrading their capabilities to conduct [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1558.0600000000002s)]
*  these kinds of attacks. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1562.7s)]
*  So we do assess that we are having an impact on their capability. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1564.14s)]
*  Certainly, everyone would like to see the Houthis stop these attacks, and we will [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1568.54s)]
*  continue to call on them to stop immediately. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1572.46s)]
*  But if they don't, we will continue to take appropriate actions to not only defend [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1576.22s)]
*  international shipping and mariners transiting the Red Sea, but also continuing to degrade [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1583.1799999999998s)]
*  and disrupt their capabilities. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1588.22s)]
*  Thank you very much, Phil. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1590.86s)]
*  In the wake of the January 28th attack on the outpost in Jordan, has the U.S. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1591.8999999999999s)]
*  military taken any steps in particular to improve safety for U.S. troops there or at [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1598.54s)]
*  other bases in the region? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1604.78s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Phil. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1606.22s)]
*  Broadly speaking, we're always going to take steps to protect our forces. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1608.78s)]
*  As I'm sure you can appreciate for operations security reasons, I'm just not able to go [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1613.26s)]
*  into specifics on what that may be other than to say I can assure you that this is top of [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1616.7s)]
*  mind not only for the Secretary of Defense but also for General Carillo. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1621.82s)]
*  But not ask me any specifics. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1624.7s)]
*  I just ask whether you've done anything. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1626.06s)]
*  We've taken appropriate measures, but that's about as specific as I can get. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1628.86s)]
*  Okay, and then you said to Laura that this was not an open-ended campaign, but I think [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1632.22s)]
*  a lot of people are wondering whether we're talking about a period of days or weeks or [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1637.82s)]
*  whether or not we'll even know when this counterattack is over. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1642.1399999999999s)]
*  What clarity can you provide? [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1648.86s)]
*  Yeah, again, we've been very clear that we are going to take appropriate action in response [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1650.62s)]
*  to the deaths of three of our service members, multiple wounded, and that we will hold those [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1657.1s)]
*  accountable. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1662.06s)]
*  Again, for operations security reasons, I'm just not going to go into timelines or forecast [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1662.7s)]
*  potential actions, again, other than we will conduct those operations in a time and manner [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1669.34s)]
*  of our choosing. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1674.46s)]
*  Let me go to Constantine. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1675.34s)]
*  Just a follow-up on Phil's point. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1677.9s)]
*  So when these attacks all began in October, yourself, you announced that we were sending [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1680.22s)]
*  units of Patriot and THAAD batteries to bolster air defenses in reaction to those strikes. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1686.62s)]
*  Now, we're not getting any specifics. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1691.82s)]
*  Is there a reason for that shift in messaging? [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1694.4599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, especially as we've seen these attacks, I just don't want to telegraph and highlight [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1697.82s)]
*  capabilities at these individual installations, especially when we have forces in harm's way. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1702.86s)]
*  And as you recall, when we announced those deployments, those were coming from the United [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1707.7399999999998s)]
*  States into theater, but what we didn't tell you was specifically where those capabilities [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1711.34s)]
*  are going and how they were going to be employed. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1715.9s)]
*  And so, again, if I'm one of those troopers on that base, I don't want to necessarily [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1720.38s)]
*  broadcast widely what capabilities we have, what capabilities we don't have. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1725.5s)]
*  Also, those announcements included a significant number of forces associated with them, which is [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1730.6200000000001s)]
*  why we announced those deployments. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1735.74s)]
*  Just one last quick follow-up. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1738.7s)]
*  Does the Pentagon feel that it has sufficient anti-drone capability in the theater right now? [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1741.18s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to get into readiness levels other than we obviously understand [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1746.0600000000002s)]
*  that counter drone is a significant requirement and something that I can assure you is taken [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1751.42s)]
*  very, very seriously. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1757.3400000000001s)]
*  Will? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1759.18s)]
*  Just to follow up on the questions on the duration of the strikes in this campaign, [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1760.14s)]
*  will the U.S. strikes continue as long as there are attacks on American personnel? [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1765.1000000000001s)]
*  Is that the end game to get this to zero? [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1768.94s)]
*  How is that defined, really? [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1773.74s)]
*  Well, we're going to take whatever necessary actions are required to protect our forces. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1775.5800000000002s)]
*  Again, I don't want to get into hypotheticals. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1781.3400000000001s)]
*  I don't want to predict the future. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1783.42s)]
*  You have U.S. military forces that are there focused on the defeat ISIS mission. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1785.5s)]
*  If those forces are threatened or harmed, we will take appropriate action. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1789.98s)]
*  I'll just leave it at that. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1794.7s)]
*  Fadi? [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1795.82s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1796.32s)]
*  I want to go back to the Iraqi government statement that they brought out. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1797.26s)]
*  They called or described the strikes as act of aggression. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1802.3s)]
*  They talked about the loss of 16 martyrs, including civilians, and 25 injured, [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1808.3s)]
*  damaged residential buildings and citizens' property. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1814.38s)]
*  Can you confirm from the podium that no civilian harm occurred in these strikes in Iraq? [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1818.06s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Fadi. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1824.54s)]
*  I think I've answered that. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1825.34s)]
*  We're continuing to assess. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1826.3s)]
*  We always will take any reports of civilian casualties seriously. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1827.9s)]
*  We will provide you updates as it becomes available. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1831.98s)]
*  At this point, you can't rule out this. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1835.18s)]
*  Again, CENTCOM is continuing to assess it. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1837.9s)]
*  The same statement said the international coalition has become the reason for [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1841.34s)]
*  endangering security and stability. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1848.7s)]
*  Despite this protest from the Iraqi government and their assertion that what happened on [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1851.34s)]
*  Friday was targeting security forces, the same security forces that the Iraqi [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1858.22s)]
*  prime minister visited in the hospital, and despite the warning that these actions [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1863.9s)]
*  endanger the stability of Iraq, are you saying that the U.S. will continue strikes inside Iraq? [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1870.8600000000001s)]
*  Fadi, again, I can't speak for the government of Iraq. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1876.8600000000001s)]
*  I'd refer you to them, obviously. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1881.18s)]
*  I think when it comes to our operations and what we targeted and what we struck, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1882.78s)]
*  I think I've been very clear what that is. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1889.8999999999999s)]
*  And again, I'll emphasize that we greatly value Iraq as a partner. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1893.42s)]
*  Their security and stability is vital to the broader region, and we'll continue to work [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1898.54s)]
*  closely with our Iraqi partners and continue to consult closely with them. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1904.62s)]
*  But as we've said before, if our forces are threatened or harmed, we have to take appropriate [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1909.18s)]
*  action and we'll take appropriate action going forward. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1914.1399999999999s)]
*  Let me go to Mike and I'll come to Wafa. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1916.78s)]
*  Yes, sir. Thanks, Pat. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1918.3s)]
*  Have you noticed any improvement in the commercial shipping situation in Aden, the Red Sea, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1919.5s)]
*  since the United States has been conducting these [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1926.86s)]
*  retaliatory strikes against the Houthis? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1930.1399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, Mike, I don't have any data in front of me in terms of commercial shipping rates. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1932.7s)]
*  I'm sure that commercial firms could provide that. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1938.3s)]
*  I will tell you that NavSent regularly communicates with those shipping houses [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1942.94s)]
*  to ensure that we understand what their needs are, what their concerns are as we conduct [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1948.94s)]
*  Operation Prosperity Guardian. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1955.34s)]
*  I am aware anecdotally of reports, as you know, of some companies choosing not to transit the Red Sea. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1957.8999999999999s)]
*  But for those that do, Operation Prosperity Guardian, which is a defensive coalition, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1965.34s)]
*  is there to ensure that there is joint security patrols in the vicinity should there be a [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1970.94s)]
*  requirement to defend those ships. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1977.5s)]
*  So that will continue to be what we stay focused on. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1978.86s)]
*  Wafa. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1981.42s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1982.22s)]
*  I have a follow-up on Iraq and then a different question. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1983.5s)]
*  Has the HMC held any meetings since Friday strikes? [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1987.82s)]
*  So Wafa, what I would tell you is that, as I understand it, the U.S. Embassy and CJTFOAR [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=1995.18s)]
*  continue to remain focused on working with our Iraqi partners regarding the HMC. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2001.82s)]
*  But in terms of timelines and for meetings, I know that they'll continue to stay focused on that, [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2013.5s)]
*  but I just don't have any updates to provide in terms of when those actual meetings will occur. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2018.94s)]
*  Jake Sullivan yesterday ruled out or didn't rule out actually strikes inside Iran. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2025.18s)]
*  Is this an option that's being considered as part of the response to the January 28th attack? [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2033.98s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to speak for Mr. Sullivan. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2044.94s)]
*  I think his words speak for themselves. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2047.18s)]
*  As I highlighted earlier, we're not going to talk about or forecast any potential future [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2049.02s)]
*  operations other than to say there will be additional responses and that those will be [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2056.46s)]
*  at a time and place of our choosing. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2062.06s)]
*  I would also, again, emphasize that we are not seeking escalation in the region, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2063.74s)]
*  just the opposite, but that we won't hesitate to protect our forces. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2068.62s)]
*  The department has, like, when it comes to Iran, red lines cannot be crossed because there is [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2072.62s)]
*  – Yeah, again, I think I've been very clear what our focus is, and I think we've been very [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2079.98s)]
*  clear from this podium that we, the United States, the Department of Defense, do not seek war with [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2085.18s)]
*  Iran, but if our forces are threatened or attacked, we will take appropriate action. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2090.54s)]
*  Time for a few more. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2094.78s)]
*  We'll go to Jared, and then we'll finish here with Jane. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2095.58s)]
*  Thanks, sir. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2098.14s)]
*  On these separate efforts in Iraq and Syria, and then on the other hand with the Houthis in Yemen, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2098.54s)]
*  not to belabor the point, but if I can ask it a different way, is the department sufficiently [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2104.22s)]
*  confident in its intelligence on Houthi material and supply lines that these strikes can successfully [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2108.2999999999997s)]
*  atrit their capabilities in the coming months? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2113.8199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2116.3799999999997s)]
*  So, Jared, what I would tell you – so first of all, I'm not going to talk about intelligence. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2116.7s)]
*  Second of all, our goal is not to completely eliminate the capabilities of Houthi forces. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2121.02s)]
*  Our goal is to disrupt and degrade their ability to conduct these attacks. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2128.54s)]
*  And as it relates to ensuring that international shipping, naval vessels, [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2133.58s)]
*  mariners can transit the Red Sea safely and securely in accordance with freedom of navigation, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2141.02s)]
*  that will continue to be our focus. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2147.8199999999997s)]
*  Not to split hairs here, but is that precisely the same approach the department is taking in Iraq? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2149.9s)]
*  Or if these attacks in Iraq continue, do you anticipate perhaps an expansion of the scope of [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2154.7000000000003s)]
*  U.S. strikes? [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2160.3s)]
*  Again, look, I'm not going to get into hypothetical situations other than our focus [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2161.26s)]
*  is on the defeat ISIS mission. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2166.2200000000003s)]
*  If our forces are threatened or attacked, we will take appropriate action. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2169.42s)]
*  Last question, Jane. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2173.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2174.38s)]
*  As you know, North Korea continues to launch cruise missiles. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2175.84s)]
*  How is the information sharing between the United States, South Korea, and Japan working now? [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2181.84s)]
*  Well, as you know, we have excellent relations between – an excellent relationship between [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2191.84s)]
*  the United States, Japan, and the Republic of Korea. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2197.84s)]
*  We will continue to share information as it relates to regional security and stability. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2201.68s)]
*  And I'll just leave it there. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2207.12s)]
*  Do you also completely track North Korea's missile launches recently? [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2208.24s)]
*  I'm not going to get into intelligence. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2215.68s)]
*  But clearly, we keep a very close eye on the region. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2217.52s)]
*  And as always, we will continue to consult closely with our allies and our partners in the region. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2221.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2226.16s)]
*  Thanks very much, everybody. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2226.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oahlCcUxC2A&t=2231.6s)]
