# Israel begins retaliatory strikes on military targets in Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE)
*  We do understand at this hour it is a fluid and developing story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=0.0s)]
*  It appears at this moment that the Israeli attack against Iran is ongoing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=4.2s)]
*  I spoke this evening with a senior official who gave us some context into the days leading [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  up to this highly anticipated Israeli strike against Iranian territory. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=14.74s)]
*  This strike, according to this senior official, was meant to send a message of deterrence [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=20.12s)]
*  to the Iranian regime, and there was communication with the Americans beforehand as the region [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=24.72s)]
*  waits to see what will come next. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=30.7s)]
*  But again, the latest information that we have, multiple explosions have been reported [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=32.879999999999995s)]
*  in and around the Iranian capital of Tehran, as well as in the northern part of Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=37.96s)]
*  We don't know the exact targets, but I am told that some of the targets were taken off [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=43.5s)]
*  the list following American pressure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=48.56s)]
*  There have been a lot of conversations taking place with top Israeli leadership here in [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=51.28s)]
*  Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem, talking with their counterparts in Washington to determine how [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  to deter the Iranians but not drag the region into a broader war. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=60.6s)]
*  Now, one other important note here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=64.92s)]
*  An Israeli official tells me the expectation is that following the strikes tonight against [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=67.44s)]
*  Iran there will be some sort of response. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=71.94s)]
*  Of course, they don't know what that response will look like, but Israeli air defense remains [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  on high alert across this country. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=79.36s)]
*  There is an understanding that Iran has the ability to target Israel with a variety of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=81.4s)]
*  ballistic missiles, as they did earlier this month when they launched 180 of them toward [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  this country. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=91.03999999999999s)]
*  And so Israel's top defense systems, including the Arrow 2 and 3 systems, do remain on alert [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=92.28s)]
*  to be able to protect some of the more sensitive targets across this country. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=98.36s)]
*  Jason? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=102.76s)]
*  Trey, let's go back to what really led to this because there was anticipated going to [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=104.76s)]
*  be some response by the Israelis. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=110.56s)]
*  Is this purely a missile attack? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=113.72s)]
*  Are there fighter jets over Iranian space at this time? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=116.12s)]
*  Do you know the details of how this attack is taking place? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=119.2s)]
*  I don't want to get into the details just given how sensitive the information is and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  the fact that it's unfolding as we speak, but we have a lot of information. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=129.44s)]
*  I've been talking with officials this evening and throughout the week in anticipation of [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=133.48s)]
*  this strike taking place. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  Remember, as we reported the past several weeks, this was not a question of if Israel [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=139.6s)]
*  would respond, but rather when and where. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=143.6s)]
*  180 ballistic missiles were fired by the Iranians. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=146.51999999999998s)]
*  And everyone from top army generals to Israel's defense minister, Yoav Galant, to the country's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=150.23999999999998s)]
*  prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, made very clear that the Iranian attack against Israel [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=155.64s)]
*  was the regime in Tehran crossing a red line. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=161.24s)]
*  The deterrence had been flipped and the Israelis wanted to restore that deterrence. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  And that is part of what they are doing with these strikes tonight against Iran, I am told. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=168.68s)]
*  And again, we don't know exactly how widespread the strikes will be and we don't know the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=173.4s)]
*  exact targets, but we do know there has been communication with the Americans. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=177.24s)]
*  Of course, there was the story of this leak earlier in the week and a real concern that [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  the American leak could have damaged the Israeli preparations. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=188.0s)]
*  I'm told that that did not affect the Israeli timeline to ultimately strike Iran. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=190.88s)]
*  But it is, of course, of concern to Israeli officials as they continue to communicate [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=195.76s)]
*  with their American counterparts about the escalating tension across the region. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=200.16s)]
*  Jason. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=204.76s)]
*  Trey, to what degree is the United States of America partnering with Israel on this [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=205.76s)]
*  attack? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=212.96s)]
*  Is it a support mechanism? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=214.16s)]
*  Are their U.S. assets being deployed? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=216.12s)]
*  Is there technology? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=218.4s)]
*  Do we have any idea of what the U.S. involvement might be in this attack that's going on right [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=220.04s)]
*  now tonight? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=225.16s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=226.16s)]
*  I asked a senior official this very question tonight and the extent at which they would [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=227.16s)]
*  describe the coordination was simply communication with the Americans. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=233.44s)]
*  There is an understanding that they don't want to send a message that the United States [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=240.20000000000002s)]
*  is directly involved in any of these attacks despite the fact that behind the scenes they [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=244.07999999999998s)]
*  may be sharing things like intelligence. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=248.32s)]
*  And we do know, of course, that the Americans have helped the Israelis to prepare for possible [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=250.51999999999998s)]
*  Iranian retaliation to the strikes that are currently taking place, Jason, as we speak. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=255.56s)]
*  Remember earlier in the week, and it really all sort of blends together for the officials [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=260.71999999999997s)]
*  here who are continuing to fight a war not just on the ground inside Gaza against Iranian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=264.3s)]
*  proxies like Hamas and Islamic Jihad, but also against Iran's largest proxy in the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=268.8s)]
*  region Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=273.12s)]
*  And the Americans deployed the FAD anti-ballistic missile system to Israel. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=275.96s)]
*  And there are less than 10 of these systems deployed around the world. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  So the fact that one was sent to Israel with American boots on the ground to make sure [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=286.08s)]
*  the system was manned and working was an indication that the Americans understood, like the Israelis, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=290.68s)]
*  that Iran would likely respond in some capacity to this counterattack following the ballistic [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=295.88s)]
*  missile attack earlier this month. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=300.84s)]
*  But remember, this was not the first Iranian attack that took place this year. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=302.8s)]
*  Back in April, the Iranians launched an attack after the Israelis targeted the building next [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=307.56s)]
*  to their embassy in Damascus, Syria. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=312.4s)]
*  And remember, when we look at the reason that the Iranians say they launched the ballistic [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=315.16s)]
*  missiles against Israel earlier this month, they said it was in response to the killing [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=318.92s)]
*  of Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, Iran's largest proxy across [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=323.32s)]
*  the Middle East, a group that has been directly involved in conflict with Israel since October [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=327.88s)]
*  8th. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=332.04s)]
*  We know that the Iranians say it was not just in response to the death of Nasrallah, the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=333.04s)]
*  strike that took place in the Lebanese capital of Beirut, but also the explosion that killed [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=337.36s)]
*  the leader of Hamas, Ismail Khaenei in Tehran, over the summer. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=341.56s)]
*  It was an embarrassment for the Iranians to have a top proxy leader killed at a guest [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=345.88s)]
*  house in the Iranian capital of Tehran while he was attending the inauguration ceremonies [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=351.36s)]
*  for Masoud Pazeski, the new Iranian president. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  So this was a joint response from the Iranians earlier this month, and that 180 ballistic [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=359.64s)]
*  missile attack that soared the skies of this country. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=366.14s)]
*  We were in the northern city of Haifa when that attack took place, and you could see [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=368.67999999999995s)]
*  some of these missiles coming in over Syria. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=372.34s)]
*  And some of them, actually we understand more than half of them, hit Israel. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=375.2s)]
*  They were not intercepted. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=379.2s)]
*  And you saw the craters across this country near to military bases and actually targeting [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  military bases where Israeli jets take off from. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=385.64s)]
*  And the Israelis saw this as, again, crossing a red line for the Iranian regime. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=388.96s)]
*  And so that is why we've been told in the briefings and the conversations that we've [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=393.44s)]
*  been having with top officials here in Tel Aviv that this was not a question of if Israel [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=396.4s)]
*  would respond, but rather when and where. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=400.76s)]
*  And as we understand tonight, Israel is striking Iran. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=403.35999999999996s)]
*  Multiple explosions have been reported in and around the Iranian capital of Tehran, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=406.79999999999995s)]
*  as well as further north. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=411.32s)]
*  And we do not know at this hour what exactly is being targeted, but Iranian state media [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=413.52s)]
*  is also confirming that these explosions have taken place, again, an indication Israel [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=418.20000000000005s)]
*  has started their attack against Iran. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDAXVVgsUIE&t=423.24s)]
