# How a 'bunker buster' bomb works
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI)
*  First, let's go straight to Trey Yankst, chief foreign correspondent. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=0.0s)]
*  He's on the ground right now in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=4.2s)]
*  Trey. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=7.08s)]
*  Harris, good afternoon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=8.08s)]
*  Overnight, the Iranians launched more ballistic missiles into Israel around 7 a.m. local time. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=10.36s)]
*  The air raid sirens started to sound across this city and others. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=16.36s)]
*  We were in the shelter and could hear the explosions overhead as some of those missiles [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=20.34s)]
*  were intercepted. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=24.48s)]
*  Others slammed into residential areas and a hospital. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=25.84s)]
*  Here's what it looked like when we arrived at that medical center. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=29.2s)]
*  Black smoke billows from the Soroka Hospital in southern Israel. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=33.28s)]
*  An Iranian missile hit the campus this morning just after 7 a.m., sending shockwaves through [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=38.0s)]
*  the halls. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=43.24s)]
*  Suddenly we heard the explosion, Juma Abou Kush says. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=45.44s)]
*  We knew it's very close to us. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Debris fell from the ceiling. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=50.64s)]
*  Throughout the day, patients were evacuated to nearby hospitals as others were discharged [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=52.56s)]
*  if their condition warranted. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=57.339999999999996s)]
*  First responders surveyed the damage as political leaders came by to voice their opposition [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=59.46s)]
*  to the bombing. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=64.1s)]
*  The regime targeted this morning is a hospital with helpless sick people. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=65.1s)]
*  This is an extreme war crime and they will bear the consequences. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=71.42s)]
*  What's also important to note is that this is a place that there are both Israelis and [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=77.02s)]
*  Palestinians coming for care. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=81.58s)]
*  There are Bedouins. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=83.2s)]
*  When you walk around the compound of this hospital, there are still people in other [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=84.26s)]
*  areas. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=87.66000000000001s)]
*  There are men wearing kippahs and women wearing hijabs. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=88.66000000000001s)]
*  And it's an example of how this part of Israel lives, how they live side by side and how [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=90.9s)]
*  there is a future. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=96.34s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister released a statement about the bombing claiming that Iran was targeting [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=100.46000000000001s)]
*  an intelligence building near to the hospital. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=104.9s)]
*  He released no additional evidence to support that claim. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=107.66000000000001s)]
*  Guys? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=110.58000000000001s)]
*  Trey, thank you very much. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=111.89999999999999s)]
*  As always, great reporting. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=112.89999999999999s)]
*  Right now, the president is getting an intel briefing inside the White House. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  And he and his team are weighing their options on whether the United States should join Israel's [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=119.58s)]
*  attacks on Iran. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=124.1s)]
*  One U.S. official has already told Fox the president has been asking questions to his [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=125.88s)]
*  aides about bunker busting bombs. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=130.5s)]
*  Exactly, what are they? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=133.3s)]
*  What do they do? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=135.06s)]
*  Get into it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=136.06s)]
*  How many would you need? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=137.06s)]
*  He says it would make the U.S. and its allies legitimate targets. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=138.54s)]
*  But the White House says all options are on the table and you know Trump means it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=143.54s)]
*  And according to the president, a ceasefire is not an option. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=148.26s)]
*  I don't want to get involved either, but I've been saying for 20 years, maybe longer, that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=153.46s)]
*  Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=158.26s)]
*  I've been saying it for a long time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  And I think they were a few weeks away from having one. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=162.02s)]
*  And they had to sign a document. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=165.54s)]
*  I think they wish they signed it now. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=167.38s)]
*  It was a fair deal. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=168.85999999999999s)]
*  And now it's a harder thing to sign. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=170.94s)]
*  You know, there's a lot of water over the dam. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=172.3s)]
*  But you know, it's very, I say it very simply, Iran can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=176.14s)]
*  So the president meeting now, we knew all morning long that he would meet and really [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=184.06s)]
*  work on this attack. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=188.9s)]
*  We'll get to more of that in a moment. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=190.18s)]
*  But you were able to obtain that incredible video that we saw, the close-up. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=191.78s)]
*  Tell me about how that came about and what you know about that situation of the hospital [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=196.5s)]
*  getting hit. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=199.10000000000002s)]
*  I know one of their top orthopedists in that hospital who's a great doctor. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=200.10000000000002s)]
*  That hospital 25 miles from Gaza, actually at October 7th, they got almost a thousand [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=204.02s)]
*  people that were injured in the attacks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=210.34s)]
*  And they saved most of them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=213.26000000000002s)]
*  It's a great hospital. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=215.0s)]
*  Only level one trauma hospital in Beersheba in southern Israel. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=217.0s)]
*  And what they actually did that was really interesting is Moshe Bar-Simon Tov, who's [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=221.10000000000002s)]
*  the health ministry director general, the day before had a premonition that something [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=224.94s)]
*  was going to happen, not inside the information. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=229.98000000000002s)]
*  And he said, let's evacuate the surgical floor. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=232.54000000000002s)]
*  They emptied the surgical floor, which got hit with the first bomb, saving hundreds of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=235.18s)]
*  lives. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  A premonition. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  The good Lord right there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  Look, I want to ask one more question about that, though, because that area in particular [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  has Muslims. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=246.82s)]
*  You heard Trey Yanks reporting about that. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=247.82s)]
*  You know, who's on the ground in that area? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=250.1s)]
*  And Beersheba is also the Bedouin. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=251.86s)]
*  I mean, if Iran was trying to knock out someplace that's going to get everybody's attention, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=253.62s)]
*  that's what they did. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=258.38s)]
*  Plus, it was a hospital. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=259.38s)]
*  Great point, Harris. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=261.14s)]
*  And I want to say something else about this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=262.14s)]
*  I've interviewed people, doctors throughout Israel at different hospitals. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  Everyone says the same thing. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=268.1s)]
*  We take care of Arabs. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=269.52s)]
*  We take care of Jews. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=270.7s)]
*  We take care of Israelis. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=271.92s)]
*  We take care of terrorists. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=273.0s)]
*  In my own training at Bellevue, I took care of people committing assaults handcuffed on [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=274.82s)]
*  stretchers next to victims. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=279.6s)]
*  That's the way doctors look at it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=281.5s)]
*  So it's beyond the disgrace to attack an undefended hospital. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  Kennedy, at this point, we know that the president has a lot on his plate in terms of whether [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=287.14s)]
*  we get involved. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=291.78000000000003s)]
*  What are the political ramifications of that right now? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  I know that the U.S. senators are going to be called in a bipartisan meeting next week [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=297.26s)]
*  to be briefed again. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=300.94s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=302.38s)]
*  And, you know, if there is a strike, I think it should, and it requires congressional support. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=303.38s)]
*  He's in a very tricky situation because, as you know, he ran on being a non-interventionist, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=310.58s)]
*  and he ran completely opposed to forever wars. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=316.18s)]
*  We've been in this position before, in 2003, as a good friend of mine who is a lawmaker [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=319.97999999999996s)]
*  pointed out. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=324.97999999999996s)]
*  It feels like deja vu because we were told some of these conflicts would be quick, they [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  would be surgical, and they would not extend beyond the boundaries of what we were sold. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=331.21999999999997s)]
*  I don't think the president wants to get into a protracted war. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=336.88s)]
*  I know his vice president doesn't. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=339.38s)]
*  We have all worked with Pete Hegsek, and he has been very, very vocal about not committing [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=341.78s)]
*  troops to theaters like Afghanistan and Iraq again because he knows firsthand what it means [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=347.1s)]
*  to be a combat veteran in this country when leadership forgets about you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=354.54s)]
*  And for that, I'm grateful that he's the secretary of defense. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=359.74s)]
*  I know he is seeking wise counsel. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=362.5s)]
*  I personally am on the side of those who are no longer hawkish in the Republican Party. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=365.62s)]
*  I think there are a lot of Democrats, as they have shown with Ukraine. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  They are very eager for a fight. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=375.86s)]
*  I think we have to take an incredibly measured approach considering that. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=377.46s)]
*  But I also think about Israel. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=381.66s)]
*  I think about their right to protect and defend themselves when, essentially, their next door [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=383.94s)]
*  neighbor, the reason for being is Israel's destruction. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=388.94s)]
*  And I also have more faith in the Israeli special forces. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=393.88s)]
*  Their capabilities, I think, go beyond what has been telegraphed in the media. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=399.2s)]
*  I will leave it at that. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=403.48s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=404.48s)]
*  Emily, before I come to you, let's take a look, if we can, at the wall that we see right [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=405.48s)]
*  now. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=409.92s)]
*  Does Iran pose a real national security threat to the United States? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=410.92s)]
*  Look, the American people are paying attention to this. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=414.64s)]
*  Seventy-three percent. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=418.04s)]
*  That is a very high number for anything, and it's certainly higher than we've seen in the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=419.16s)]
*  past. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=423.08s)]
*  What do you think is the shift that's happening right now with an American public watching? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=424.08s)]
*  Well, interestingly, I think history sort of paints a different picture of the present [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=428.15999999999997s)]
*  view versus hindsight. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=432.68s)]
*  So for example, and we studied this in Poland just a couple of weeks ago, but the polls [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=434.47999999999996s)]
*  prior to World War II were staunchly over 80 percent of Americans were against intervening [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=438.02s)]
*  in World War II. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=442.96s)]
*  And you contrast that at the beginning of the endless Iran or Iraq-Afghanistan theater, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=443.96s)]
*  where the majority of public support was with intervening, and then in hindsight, both of [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=450.2s)]
*  those have inversely flipped. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=454.12s)]
*  I think the conversation on the spectrum, it sort of bears discussion of what does intervention [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=455.59999999999997s)]
*  mean and does one bomb mean intervention, or does that mean strength without spread? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=461.2s)]
*  Is that the answer to or the antidote to those that don't want mission creep? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=467.68s)]
*  And for those that believe so strongly that our just atrocious, botched Afghanistan exit [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=472.12s)]
*  absolutely betrayed our allies, then is this sort of a twofold? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=478.4s)]
*  We stand up for our allies while also protecting American interests in the knowledge that this [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=482.67999999999995s)]
*  emboldened enemy, via the prior administration, through inaction, has now threatened death [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=487.96s)]
*  to America with action. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=494.12s)]
*  You see it in criminal law, right? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=495.71999999999997s)]
*  You get prosecuted if it's a threat coupled with an overt action. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=497.76s)]
*  What are those 603 American lives lost at the hands of Iran already? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=500.96s)]
*  They have demonstrated time and time again, it's not just words, it's actual meaningful [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=505.6s)]
*  actions with the ultimate goal of eradication of the great Satan and also Israel. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=509.72s)]
*  So all of those combined to, I think, requires at least some measure of showing up today [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=514.96s)]
*  for Israel, but also for those Americans that President Trump swore he would indeed protect [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=520.16s)]
*  with American interests primarily without an endless war. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=524.6s)]
*  Well this president definitely knows he puts America first, so he's got a doctrine to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=528.32s)]
*  carry him through all of that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=532.4s)]
*  The last four years, well it gave us what we got, a mess, because there wasn't clarity [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=534.04s)]
*  there. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=538.4s)]
*  You mentioned this and I want to go deeper on the Bunker Buster bomb and how it works. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=539.4s)]
*  Let's take a look now. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=542.92s)]
*  First it requires the use of a BT stealth bomber. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=544.32s)]
*  It's the only aircraft currently programmed to carry that 30,000 pound payload that they [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=546.84s)]
*  are considering. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=551.72s)]
*  Once in position, the B-2 drops two bombs, which are guided to target with GPS and internal [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=552.72s)]
*  navigation systems. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=558.64s)]
*  The first bomb burrows into the ground and explodes creating a hole up to 200 feet below [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=559.76s)]
*  the surface. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=564.4s)]
*  The second bomb follows into that same hole, further burrowing into the ground and exploding [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=565.4s)]
*  well below the 200 foot mark. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=569.96s)]
*  So they got to drill into that mountain where the Fordo nuclear site is. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=572.4s)]
*  And I know you have a reaction to that and a little bit about policy. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=577.76s)]
*  Yeah, that would be a precision strike, which is what we're talking about. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=580.72s)]
*  President Trump, his doctrine is peace through strength. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=584.72s)]
*  An optimal word in that is strength and identifying the moments to show American strength as he [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=587.16s)]
*  did with Soleimani al-Baghdadi when he acted in Syria in 2017. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=591.2199999999999s)]
*  To the isolationist crowd, my question would be what makes your position materially different [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=595.56s)]
*  than the beachside foreign policy of Joe Biden? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=601.0s)]
*  Sticking your head in the sand is no different than sitting in the sandy beaches of Delaware [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=603.56s)]
*  and saying don't. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=607.52s)]
*  When we just said don't, which is what Biden said, what it got us was two global wars, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=608.92s)]
*  one in Israel, one in Ukraine, both of which are raging. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=612.6s)]
*  It got us the fall of a country to the Taliban. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=615.36s)]
*  These are the facts. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=617.92s)]
*  The facts are this. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=618.92s)]
*  Iran is in the weakest position they have ever been in, not because of the United States, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=619.92s)]
*  because of what Israel has done. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=623.52s)]
*  This is a narrow window I don't believe we will ever have again. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=625.76s)]
*  A narrow window to conduct a pinpoint strike. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=629.44s)]
*  Not regime change. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=633.16s)]
*  President Trump has said I'm not taking out Khamenei. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=634.16s)]
*  Not ground forces. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=636.92s)]
*  A precision strike to take out a nuclear weapons site that only the United States can do. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=637.92s)]
*  That's the opportunity. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=644.08s)]
*  That's the moment. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=645.5600000000001s)]
*  And here's the alternative. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  Politico Playbook says meanwhile in Europe. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  Okay, well what's happening in Europe? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=650.1600000000001s)]
*  Foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain plan to hold nuclear talks with Iranian counterparts. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=652.36s)]
*  Who do I trust more? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=657.4000000000001s)]
*  Germany and France to conduct foreign policy on behalf of the world to make sure nuclear [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=659.32s)]
*  proliferation doesn't happen? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=664.22s)]
*  Or the man that gave us peace through strength? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=666.24s)]
*  Decimated ISIS. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=669.08s)]
*  The man who doesn't want forever wars. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=670.6s)]
*  The man who made sure no wars happened on his watch and in four presidencies Russia [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=672.8s)]
*  did not invade under Trump's watch. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=677.64s)]
*  That is the man in charge. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=680.68s)]
*  That is the commander in chief. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=681.8s)]
*  It's not the past presidents, republicans and democrats. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=682.9599999999999s)]
*  It's the man who understands that doctrine. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=685.52s)]
*  Real quickly, we saw a decided slowdown in the decision making process. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=688.0799999999999s)]
*  I mean the world was ready to jump, but President Trump said no I'm going to take my time. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=692.1999999999999s)]
*  I might even still talk to Iran. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=697.28s)]
*  He may say no. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=698.9599999999999s)]
*  The man you worked for, you weren't surprised to see that. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=699.9599999999999s)]
*  Yeah and I can tell you this, look what negotiation would be okay with him? [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=702.28s)]
*  What agreement? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=706.52s)]
*  I personally believe nothing short of America going in and watching the dismantling of Fordow [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=707.76s)]
*  would be something he would agree to. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=712.8s)]
*  His agreement would be one that would ensure Iran does not get nuclear weapons. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=714.72s)]
*  We can't just make it the IAEA rule. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=717.72s)]
*  No, they're feckless. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=719.72s)]
*  They're weak. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=720.72s)]
*  They're the UN. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=721.72s)]
*  Who makes statements but do nothing? [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt41rLX9krI&t=722.72s)]
