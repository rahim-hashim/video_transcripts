# ‘MAKE A DEAL,’ Trump sends letter to Iran, issues new warning to Russia
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8)
*  Two big foreign policy moves making big news today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=0.0s)]
*  The first on Iran. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=3.68s)]
*  The president says he is calling on Tehran [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=4.88s)]
*  to come to the table to negotiate a nuclear deal. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=7.76s)]
*  This from a preview of the president's interview [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=11.36s)]
*  with our own Maria Bartiromo [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=14.48s)]
*  that will air in its entirety Sunday. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=16.16s)]
*  I hope that Iran, and I've written him a letter saying, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=19.76s)]
*  I hope you're going to negotiate, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=23.36s)]
*  because if we have to go in militarily, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=25.2s)]
*  it's going to be a terrible thing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=28.32s)]
*  You wrote a letter to the Khomeini? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  When did you send the letter? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=33.36s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=34.96s)]
*  And you said you better negotiate, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  or we want you to negotiate? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=37.68s)]
*  I didn't say you better. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  I said, I hope you're going to negotiate, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=39.04s)]
*  because it's going to be a lot better for Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=41.2s)]
*  And I think they want to get that letter. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=44.160000000000004s)]
*  The other alternative is we have to do something [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=47.52s)]
*  because you can't let them have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=49.68000000000001s)]
*  And on Russia, the president posted this earlier [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=52.64s)]
*  based on the fact that Russia is absolutely pounding Ukraine [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=55.36s)]
*  on the battlefield right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=59.28s)]
*  I am strongly considering large-scale banking sanctions, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=61.2s)]
*  sanctions, and tariffs on Russia [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=65.6s)]
*  until a ceasefire and final settlement agreement on peace [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=67.76s)]
*  is reached. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=71.04s)]
*  To Russia and Ukraine, get to the table right now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=72.64s)]
*  before it is too late, says the president. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=75.2s)]
*  National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  spoke to Fox about this just a short time ago. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=79.92s)]
*  President Trump is adamant that we need to get everybody [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=84.16s)]
*  to the table, and we could do that with carrots. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  And we could do that with sticks. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=89.28s)]
*  And he's talking to everybody, and he's got, you know, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=90.64s)]
*  a whole litany of potential proposals [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  that he could throw their way to get them to the table. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=95.6s)]
*  But the bottom line is the president wants to stop the carnage. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  In focus, Republican Congresswoman [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=103.2s)]
*  and Nancy Mace of South Carolina. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  She's a member of the House Oversight Armed Services [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=106.64s)]
*  and Veterans Affairs Committees and joins us now. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=108.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=111.28s)]
*  Good to see you, Congresswoman. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=112.0s)]
*  So as we do anticipate the president a short time from now, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=113.36s)]
*  what do you expect from him? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=116.16s)]
*  Well, if we're talking about Middle East policy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=117.52s)]
*  and Russia policy, if that's what he's speaking on today, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=120.16s)]
*  I just got back from the Middle East recently, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=121.92s)]
*  I spent some time in Israel, met with Bibi Netanyahu, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=123.76s)]
*  and understand the stakes right now with Iran. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=126.32s)]
*  I was glad to hear the letter that he sent to the regime [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=129.12s)]
*  because we cannot allow Iran to get nuclear arms [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=132.4s)]
*  in any way, shape or form. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=134.96s)]
*  We don't want Iran to go to China or go to Russia [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=136.64s)]
*  to get the things that they need to be nuclear armed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=139.68s)]
*  I hope that he'll look at also doing more severe [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=143.12s)]
*  sanctions against Iran banking and finance against those [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=147.36s)]
*  that are funding the proxy wars in the Middle East. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=150.08s)]
*  Their funding has Bala, Hamas, the Houthis in Yemen, et cetera. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  We need to cut them off and we need to cut them off now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=156.24s)]
*  And he understands the importance of peace [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=158.56s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=160.0s)]
*  He also understands the importance of peace in Ukraine. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=160.88s)]
*  We saw when Zelensky visited the White House a week ago, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=164.0s)]
*  President Trump was the only one that wanted peace in that room. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=167.68s)]
*  Zelensky seems to still want war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=170.0s)]
*  So I am glad to hear that he's looking at sanctions [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  for Putin, for Russia to see if they can hold off [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=175.12s)]
*  any more of the bloodshed that's been happening in Ukraine. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=178.72s)]
*  I hope that President Zelensky will come back to the table [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=180.95999999999998s)]
*  with Donald Trump and do the mineral deal [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=183.84s)]
*  so that we can have peace over there and get this thing, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=186.0s)]
*  get a ceasefire done everywhere. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=188.16s)]
*  He's the guy that can make this deal happen. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=190.07999999999998s)]
*  How confident are you that that will happen? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=191.76s)]
*  Well, we did hear from Zelensky earlier this week [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  making overtures that he was willing to come back [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=198.64s)]
*  to the White House and do the mineral deal with the president. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=200.72s)]
*  Sounds like he may, maybe has come to his census. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=203.12s)]
*  And for the country of Ukraine and for her people, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=206.96s)]
*  I hope that he does because if Donald Trump can do this deal [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  and get peace in Ukraine, then the lives lost, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=212.96s)]
*  there'll be no more. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=217.04s)]
*  And that needs to happen because Trump is the only one [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=217.76s)]
*  that wants peace right now. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=219.52s)]
*  And I believe he's the only guy that can bring it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=220.4s)]
*  Do you think this very open public form of negotiating [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=222.24s)]
*  is working for this administration? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=226.8s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  I absolutely do because the world knows [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=230.72s)]
*  that Trump is a man of his word. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  He demonstrated that in his first administration. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=234.88s)]
*  He is demonstrating that now. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=237.84s)]
*  Everything he said he was going to do, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=239.52s)]
*  the promises he's made, those are promises [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=240.88s)]
*  that he's also keeping right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=243.52s)]
*  And since I just got back from the Middle East, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=245.92s)]
*  understanding the nuances, what's at stake there, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=248.48s)]
*  seeing the way Gulf states want to see peace [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=252.16s)]
*  as well in the Middle East, he's doing it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=254.32s)]
*  I mean, everyone's very worried and concerned, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=257.04s)]
*  especially given some of the expirations [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  that are happening in the JCPOA. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=260.96s)]
*  The amount of time, whether it's months or weeks [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=262.96s)]
*  that Iran can take to get to nuclear arms, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=265.76s)]
*  we don't want that to happen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=268.47999999999996s)]
*  We need someone who's going to be a leader [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  on the world stage to ensure that Iran [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=271.91999999999996s)]
*  is not armed with nuclear weapons [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  and Trump's the one doing it. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=276.0s)]
*  All right, I want to ask you about another topic [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=278.0s)]
*  that could come up when we hear from the president [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=280.32s)]
*  any moment now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=282.47999999999996s)]
*  A win for the Department of Government Efficiency. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  A federal judge, congresswoman, denied an emergency effort [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=286.16s)]
*  to keep Doge from assessing Treasury Department data. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  This all comes as President Trump is putting [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=292.48s)]
*  a finer point on Doge's mission. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=295.52000000000004s)]
*  He's praising Elon Musk's work, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=298.08000000000004s)]
*  but telling his cabinet secretaries [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  they should make staffing and policy decisions, not Musk. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=302.56s)]
*  So the president says he wants biweekly meetings [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=306.48s)]
*  between Musk and his cabinet to focus on a scalpel approach [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=308.8s)]
*  as opposed to a hatchet. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=312.64000000000004s)]

*  Elon has been really teaching everybody [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=316.16s)]

*  but what I want is I want the numbers, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  but I also want to keep the good people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=324.0s)]
*  We want to get rid of the people that aren't working, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=326.08000000000004s)]

*  We have, you can't have that kind of fat. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=331.12s)]
*  It's bloat and like nobody's ever seen before, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=332.88s)]
*  where you need 20,000 and they have 120,000 people [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=337.36s)]
*  and you just don't need that many. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=341.12s)]
*  Doge is estimating big savings so far, $105 billion, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=343.36s)]
*  and Americans appear to be loving it, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=347.44s)]
*  much to the surprise of the liberal media. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=349.68s)]
*  This to me was one of the more shocking figures that I saw. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=353.76s)]
*  Made me go, wait a minute, hold on one second. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=356.96s)]
*  Whoa, Americans on Trump and Joe's efforts. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=359.28s)]
*  Musk and Doge should influence government spending [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=362.08s)]
*  and operations, look at this, 54%. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=364.8s)]
*  The majority say that he and they should. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=367.12s)]
*  How about a proof of Trump trying to cut staff [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=369.76s)]
*  at government agencies? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=371.68s)]

*  It does appear that this is winning the support [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=378.8s)]
*  of the American public. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=380.64s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=382.88s)]

*  and talked to different voters and citizens of our country. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=386.64s)]
*  They love Elon Musk, they love Donald Trump, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=390.0s)]
*  they love seeing the pair together. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=392.24s)]
*  They love seeing what Doge is doing to showcase the waste, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=393.52s)]
*  the fraud and the abuse. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=397.12s)]
*  They know that half of the government workforce [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=398.64s)]
*  hasn't been showing up to the office the last four years. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=401.12s)]
*  They understand that and if they gotta go to work, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=403.92s)]
*  they want federal government employees to go to work [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=405.76s)]
*  and they don't want to send checks for millions of dollars [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=407.76s)]
*  to study Russian cats on treadmills. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=411.52s)]

*  And again, this is a promise that Donald Trump made. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=422.8s)]
*  It's a promise that he's keeping and that he's delivering. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=425.6s)]
*  And I think Elon Musk is doing an enormous service [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=428.48s)]
*  to our country and I'm very grateful for it. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=431.68s)]

*  We're still awaiting more details [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=442.96000000000004s)]
*  on a reported executive order that aims to do exactly that. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=444.88s)]
*  Education Secretary Linda McMahon [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=448.24s)]
*  is backing the president this was from this morning. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=450.56s)]
*  He's made it crystal clear [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=455.52000000000004s)]
*  since the time he was running for president [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=457.28s)]
*  that this is his intent. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=458.96s)]
*  He wants to make sure that education is [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=460.23999999999995s)]
*  back at the state level where it belongs. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=463.11999999999995s)]
*  That our local school boards, that governors and teachers [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=466.64s)]
*  and parents are really the ones that are involved [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=469.52s)]
*  mostly in their children's education. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  When 70% of our students cannot read with proficiency, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=473.91999999999996s)]
*  that's just incredibly difficult to swallow [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=479.03999999999996s)]
*  and he's just not gonna accept it. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=481.84s)]
*  And as Secretary McMahon mentioned, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=484.08s)]
*  the most recent national report card, it is alarming. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=485.6s)]
*  Less than one third of fourth and eighth grade students [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=488.32000000000005s)]
*  got passing scores in reading. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  Similarly, awful numbers in math. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=494.0s)]
*  Trump doubling down on his plans [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=495.68s)]
*  to dismantle the education department. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=497.44s)]
*  I wanna bring the schools back to the states [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=501.12s)]
*  and I've said it a hundred times, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=505.12s)]
*  we're ranked at the bottom of the list [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=507.44s)]
*  and yet we spend more. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  I wanna just do it. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=510.0s)]
*  I mean, we're starting the process. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=510.88s)]
*  We're trying to get the schools back into the states [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=512.24s)]
*  let the states run the schools. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=515.5200000000001s)]
*  The House Education Committee chair tells Fox [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=518.32s)]
*  he is all for Trump's ideas. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=520.48s)]
*  I support him in the fact that we need [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=524.1600000000001s)]
*  to abolish the Department of Education, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=526.4000000000001s)]
*  return education to the states, especially for the K-12 [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=528.5600000000001s)]
*  but gain control of the higher ed institutions [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=532.6400000000001s)]
*  and make them work again. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=537.36s)]
*  Whether we can abolish it or not is a question. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=540.32s)]
*  It takes votes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=543.2800000000001s)]
*  All right, so what do you wanna see happen here [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=544.72s)]
*  at Congresswoman? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=546.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, Donald Trump is putting the power of education [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=548.0s)]
*  back into the hands of the people and parents [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=550.72s)]
*  by wanting to dismantle the Department of Education [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=552.8s)]
*  and putting that effort back into the states [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=555.92s)]
*  and I'm a high school dropout. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=558.0s)]
*  So I know very clearly how important it is to be educated [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  and how much harder it is when you're not educated [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=562.08s)]
*  and he's right, we spend almost more money [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  than any other country in the world per pupil, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=565.84s)]
*  per student and spending [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=569.36s)]
*  and yet we're last since how many outcomes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=570.56s)]
*  We also need to have a greater focus on vocational skills. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=572.32s)]
*  We should go back to either when you graduate [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=575.0400000000001s)]
*  from high school, you go on to college [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=577.36s)]

*  whether it's plumbing, electrician, carpentry. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  There are really great jobs that are out there [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=583.2s)]
*  and I'm glad to see that this is happening [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=585.2s)]
*  because I wanna see more focus on teachers and students [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=587.12s)]
*  and getting an education and less on teachers unions. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=590.08s)]
*  The Department of Education has become a slush fund [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=592.8000000000001s)]
*  for teachers unions who are more about advocacy [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=595.5200000000001s)]
*  and politics and about educating our students [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=598.5600000000001s)]
*  and we're failing our country [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15Kn2ncZT-8&t=600.8s)]
