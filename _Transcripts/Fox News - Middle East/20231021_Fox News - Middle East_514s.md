# Israel's top general orders his men to prepare for ground combat: Tomlinson
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos)
*  The big weekend show begins with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello everyone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=19.92s)]
*  I'm Julie Banderas alongside Griff Jenkins, Katie Pavlik and Joey Jones. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=20.92s)]
*  Tonight a new message from Israel ahead of its imminent ground assault on Hamas. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=25.08s)]
*  The Israeli military saying it will increase attacks on the Gaza Strip beginning right [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=31.08s)]
*  now to prepare for the next stage of the war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=36.44s)]
*  Tens of thousands of IDF troops mounting near the Gaza border as we speak where 210 hostages [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=39.76s)]
*  are now confirmed as being held by the terrorists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=47.2s)]
*  An Israeli strikes while they are striking back after an Israeli American reservist [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=50.16s)]
*  is killed by a Hezbollah missile fired from Lebanon. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=56.0s)]
*  We're going to take you to Lebanon live in just a moment but first to Lucas Tomlinson. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=58.919999999999995s)]
*  He joins us live from Tel Aviv. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=63.379999999999995s)]
*  Lucas. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=67.12s)]
*  Julie, Israel's top general is very blunt. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=68.12s)]
*  He says his forces will soon be entering Gaza and has ordered his men to prepare for ground [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=71.66s)]
*  combat. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  We are going to go into the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=78.92s)]
*  We will embark on a professional operational mission to destroy Hamas operatives and Hamas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=83.4s)]
*  infrastructure. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=89.08000000000001s)]
*  And we will have in our mind the memories of the images and those who fell on Saturday [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=90.08000000000001s)]
*  two weeks ago. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Now Israeli forces taking in some live fire training but experts say what you're seeing [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=98.60000000000001s)]
*  here on the screen will bear very little resemblance to the urban combat those forces will be facing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=102.62s)]
*  Historically when you look at urban combat from the famous battles of Hue to Fallujah [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=109.0s)]
*  there's nothing easy about it to put it mildly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=112.78s)]
*  Hamas will be waiting. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  They have likely booby trapped the remaining buildings that have not already been leveled. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  One of the goals of the IDF push Hamas out to sea and prevent Gaza from being a rocket [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=120.82s)]
*  launch platform and a place to plan the worst massacre in Israel's 75 year history. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  Since the beginning of the war two weeks ago the IDF says Hamas has had 550 failed rocket [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=133.38s)]
*  launches that landed inside the Gaza Strip not Israel and that included the deadly misfire [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=138.38s)]
*  that hit a parking lot near a hospital earlier this week. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=143.7s)]
*  Now earlier today the first 20 trucks carrying humanitarian aid entered Gaza through Egypt. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  President Biden recently said here in Israel he's pledged a hundred million dollars to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=151.7s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=156.06s)]
*  We went to a morgue at an Israeli army base where some of the fourteen hundred Israelis [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=158.06s)]
*  killed by Hamas have been taken. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=162.1s)]
*  An army reservist told us some of the bodies arrived booby trapped. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=163.78s)]
*  Babies had their heads cut off. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=167.86s)]
*  She said she never thought she'd see atrocities worse than the Holocaust until now. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=169.3s)]
*  A warning to our viewers. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=173.38s)]
*  This is graphic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=174.96s)]
*  We've seen evidence of rape that is so cruel that pelvises were broken, bones were broken. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=177.34s)]
*  It probably takes a lot to break a pelvis. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=182.70000000000002s)]
*  Legs were broken and this is grandmothers down to children. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=185.54000000000002s)]
*  One body that came in they thought it was one body and only when they took a CT did [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=189.06s)]
*  they see two spines and they saw they were able to see that these were a mother and a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=195.17999999999998s)]
*  child locked in an embrace. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=200.54s)]
*  Now Julie mentioned Israel turning up the volume on those airstrikes in Gaza. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=204.38s)]
*  Some of those Israeli F-15s that launched from here in Israel are only a few minutes [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=208.26s)]
*  away from their targets. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=211.72s)]
*  They actually have to fly a bunch of miles over the Med right over there to properly [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=212.72s)]
*  arm those satellite guided bombs. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=216.28s)]
*  Julie? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  Lucas as you know there have been many delays as far as this Israel ground invasion. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  One of the many reasons could very well be and the president has alluded to this, the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=225.70000000000002s)]
*  evacuation of innocent civilians. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=230.54s)]
*  What do you believe right now is the biggest holdup in this ground invasion? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=233.46s)]
*  Well President Biden said what he was going on aboard Air Force One yesterday when the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=237.62s)]
*  question was posed would you like to see the ground assault on Gaza delayed in order to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=243.82000000000002s)]
*  get more hostages released. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=248.42000000000002s)]
*  We saw the release of those two American hostages that Chicago area mother and daughter just [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=249.74s)]
*  yesterday and the president said yes. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=255.46s)]
*  Now the White House later walked that back but it's pretty clear that there is pressure [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=257.66s)]
*  from the White House and European governments. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=262.02000000000004s)]
*  In fact the French President Macron is due here in Israel in just a few days. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=264.74s)]
*  There's pressure for Israel to delay that ground assault in order to attempt to free [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=268.66s)]
*  more hostages. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=273.21999999999997s)]
*  Of course we've spoken a lot about the two Americans released. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=274.21999999999997s)]
*  Of course there's over 200 Israeli hostages that tonight are in captivity in Gaza and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=276.94s)]
*  of course you have 10 missing Americans many thought to also be held captive in Gaza. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=281.9s)]
*  Julie? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=287.02s)]
*  So Lucas great to see you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=288.02s)]
*  The Rafah border was opened to let aid into the Gaza Strip today. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=289.58s)]
*  They're calling it life-saving aid to Palestinians running short of food, medicine and water. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=294.02s)]
*  This also came as a result of pressure from a number of governments on the Israelis to [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=299.58s)]
*  do this. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=304.58s)]
*  They were concerned about Hamas stealing this aid and potentially smuggling in additional [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=305.58s)]
*  weapons. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=311.46s)]
*  And have you heard anything about whether these shipments were actually inspected or [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=312.46s)]
*  were they just pushed right through? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=317.82s)]
*  Well there's some reports out of Egypt Katie saying exactly what you just said that they [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=320.74s)]
*  were not inspected and officials also say there was no fuel in some of those convoys. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=325.46s)]
*  Of course fuel that could be used to help Hamas. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=330.53999999999996s)]
*  But certainly that's one of the pledges that President Biden made when he came here to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=334.14s)]
*  Tel Aviv. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=337.65999999999997s)]
*  He said he had put pressure on the Israelis to open up this humanitarian corridor out [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=338.65999999999997s)]
*  of Egypt. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=342.82s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was very clear though no aid will be going from Israel [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=343.82s)]
*  directly into Gaza. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=348.5s)]
*  Lucas it's Griff and I want to talk to you a little bit about the battle space you mentioned [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=350.5s)]
*  in your report. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=354.1s)]
*  This may be the invasion of Gaza similar to that in Fallujah where Joey served where I [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=355.38s)]
*  was although in this case it's considerably more complicated because it's even denser. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=360.78000000000003s)]
*  Talk to me a little bit about what they're going into and what you're hearing about how [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=367.34000000000003s)]
*  they intend to deal with that fighting environment. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=371.26000000000005s)]
*  Well just last night I was talking to some officials here on the ground and they were [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=376.98s)]
*  saying that you know your typical Hamas home. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=379.98s)]
*  It's going to be like a kill house out of a Dr. Seuss book. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=383.46000000000004s)]
*  Not exaggerating just the difficulty level you know Hamas. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=387.02000000000004s)]
*  They haven't just had two weeks prepare for this battle they've had years. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=390.06s)]
*  Some of these tunnels that run under Gaza and into Israel by the way you know some of [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=393.7s)]
*  them are you know over 100 feet deep and and they not just keep you know stores of weapons [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=397.72s)]
*  but just just the tactics and as Joey knows very well just the difficulty of clearing [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=402.86s)]
*  a house you know going room to room floor to floor. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=408.5s)]
*  And all it takes is one Hamas operative hiding behind a door hiding in a room maybe even [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=412.14000000000004s)]
*  you know five apartment houses down complexes down to be able to inflict pain on the Israeli [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=416.86s)]
*  forces. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=422.26000000000005s)]
*  There's just nothing easy about clearing a house no matter how much technology the Israeli [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  forces have. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=427.94s)]
*  Lucas I want to turn the focus just a little bit. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=428.94s)]
*  You're in Tel Aviv one of the largest city in Israel. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=431.34000000000003s)]
*  What is life like for Israelis. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=436.38s)]
*  Are kids going back to school. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  Is there a contingent of Israelis that are back to normal life or is the entire country [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=439.92s)]
*  in a feeling of hey we're in we're in war right now. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=444.64000000000004s)]
*  Joey the streets are much quieter than you see normally on for most people when they [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=449.88s)]
*  visit here to Israel the Carmel market just a few blocks away. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_j9kzC2yos&t=453.8s)]
