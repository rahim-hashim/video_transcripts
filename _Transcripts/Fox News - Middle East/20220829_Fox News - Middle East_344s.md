# How is Facebook involved in the FBI's Hunter Biden probe?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM)
*  Joining us now, Senator Lindsey Graham from the great state of South Carolina. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, let's start. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=4.16s)]
*  I want to start with a clip from Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Hunter Biden and then [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=5.16s)]
*  talk to you on the other side. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  The FBI, I think, basically came to us, some folks on our team, it was like, hey, just [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=13.68s)]
*  so you know, like, you should be on high alert. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=19.56s)]
*  There was the, we thought that there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=21.6s)]
*  We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump of, that's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=26.88s)]
*  similar to that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=35.04s)]
*  So just be vigilant. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=36.08s)]
*  I mean, it sucks. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=37.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=38.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=39.08s)]
*  I mean, because, I mean, it turned out after the fact, I mean, the fact checkers looked [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=40.08s)]
*  into it. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  No one was able to say it was false. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Oh, hey. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=45.32s)]
*  So the FBI says it routinely warns people about potential misinformation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=46.92s)]
*  I wonder why they didn't warn themselves or the FISA court in 2016. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  Well, you had a really good, high minded discussion with your last guests. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=56.2s)]
*  I'm just going to get really to the bottom of all of this. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=61.32s)]
*  Most Republicans, including me, believes when it comes to Trump, there is no law. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=64.92s)]
*  It's all about getting him. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=72.0s)]
*  There's a double standard when it comes to Trump. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  What happened with Hunter Biden is that the FBI weighed in to make sure a story didn't [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=76.88000000000001s)]
*  break for the 2020 election. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=81.48s)]
*  We now have whistleblowers at the FBI telling Senator Grassley that they were told to slow [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=83.68s)]
*  down and back off Hunter Biden. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=88.84s)]
*  And I'll say this, if there's a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=91.64s)]
*  information after the Clinton debacle, which you presided over and did a hell of a good [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=96.72s)]
*  job, there'll be riots in the streets. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I'm a simple minded guy, Senator. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=105.64s)]
*  I think people ought to be treated the same without regard to political ideology. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=108.52s)]
*  And I remember that Jim Comey press conference really, really, really well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=112.4s)]
*  All right. I want to ask you about something you care about and have from the entire time [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=116.36s)]
*  I've known you, which is our foreign policy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=120.12s)]
*  We are at the one year mark in Afghanistan after the withdrawal. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=122.08s)]
*  I want to play a clip from you, from General McKenzie, and then get you to react to what [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=126.08s)]
*  he said. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=130.4s)]
*  So in your opinion, was the withdrawal a mistake? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=132.72s)]
*  I advised against withdrawing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=137.28s)]
*  My recommendation and my opinion, and it remains so today, was we had the opportunity to remain [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=139.8s)]
*  in the country with a small force. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=144.68s)]
*  I realize the Taliban could very well have chosen to attack us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  But I do not believe, based on the intelligence I was reading at the time, that we would have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=150.48000000000002s)]
*  been forced to add more forces in order to maintain a, you know, a 2,500 force level [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=156.24s)]
*  in Afghanistan. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=161.6s)]
*  Where are we one year later after the withdrawal, Senator? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=164.96s)]
*  Well, we're more exposed to another attack than we've ever been. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=169.04s)]
*  The Taliban are back in charge of Afghanistan. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=173.4s)]
*  Al Qaeda and ISIS are thriving in Afghanistan. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=176.32s)]
*  They desire to hit our homeland. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=180.24s)]
*  Joe Biden canceled the residual force insurance policy to make sure they couldn't gather up [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=182.12s)]
*  over there to hit us here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=187.32s)]
*  President Biden says he has no regrets about what he did in Afghanistan. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=189.28s)]
*  He's a fool if he really believes that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=194.0s)]
*  I have a lot of regrets about what he did. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=196.24s)]
*  I regret the fact that we left thousands of our allies behind who bravely fought along [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=198.44s)]
*  our side. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=203.08s)]
*  I regret the fact that all the women that kind of believed in us have been turned back [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=204.08s)]
*  over to the Taliban. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  I regret the fact that Afghanistan is going to become another breeding ground for terrorism, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=210.8s)]
*  and most likely another 9-11 will emanate there going through a broken southern border. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=217.04s)]
*  So the general is right. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=221.72s)]
*  He gave the president sound military advice. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=223.12s)]
*  And if Joe Biden doesn't regret what he did in Afghanistan, he really is deaf, dumb, and blind. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=226.6s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=232.48s)]
*  Before I let you go, the district attorney in Georgia is apparently a huge fan of yours. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=234.39999999999998s)]
*  And she's even willing to go to court for a chance to meet you in person. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=239.48s)]
*  That's how much she wants to meet you in person. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=243.84s)]
*  Look, you and I are laughing. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=246.16s)]
*  It's actually really serious. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=248.88s)]
*  Should all members of the House and Senate begin to block off time for state prosecutors [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  going forward? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=254.92s)]
*  Is that where we are? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=255.92s)]
*  Well, if we let county prosecutors start calling senators and members of Congress as witnesses [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=256.92s)]
*  when they're doing their job, then you're going to throw out of kilter our constitutional [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=263.96s)]
*  balance here. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=268.28s)]
*  I've got a good legal case. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=269.36s)]
*  I'm going to pursue it. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=270.64s)]
*  But I just want to sort of end in this note. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=272.12s)]
*  You love the law. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=274.68s)]
*  I've never been more worried about the law and politics as I am right now. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=276.6s)]
*  How can you tell a conservative Republican that the system works when it comes to Trump? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  Look at what happened with Crossfire Hurricane. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=284.88s)]
*  It was a joke of an investigation. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=287.12s)]
*  People lied and manipulated the evidence. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=289.24s)]
*  Look what happened to Hunter Biden. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=291.56s)]
*  They gave him a complete pass, apparently, and the social media outlets in this country [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=292.88s)]
*  suppressed information that could have mattered. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=298.36s)]
*  If they try to prosecute President Trump for mishandling classified information after Hillary [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=301.08s)]
*  Clinton set up a server in her basement, they literally will be riots in the street. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=306.15999999999997s)]
*  I worry about our country. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=310.6s)]
*  I do too. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=312.15999999999997s)]
*  The lady is blindfolded for a reason. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=314.44s)]
*  When you begin to start peeking out from behind that blindfold, you're finished as a republic. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=316.32s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Lindsey Graham from the great state of South Carolina. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=321.56s)]
*  This is the only way that I know for sure that you're not going to miss any great commentary, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=330.88s)]
*  any great news bites, any great interviews coming your way on Fox. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dpTUoSEBWM&t=334.88s)]
