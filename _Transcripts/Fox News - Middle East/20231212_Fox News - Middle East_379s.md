# Former political prisoner in Iran: 'Looking for justification' for terrorism
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4)
*  Our U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria coming under attack 92 times since mid-October. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=0.0s)]
*  And today lawmakers will be briefed on the very real threat we face from Iran and its [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=5.26s)]
*  proxies. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=9.98s)]
*  We've had over 90 attacks on our troops in Iraq and Syria from Iran-backed militias. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=10.98s)]
*  And for the most part, that's gone without any response. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  The United States military is not authorized by Congress to attack Iran in the country [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=21.72s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=28.56s)]
*  We can respond in self-defense when they attack our troops. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=30.04s)]
*  We have to show strength deterrence to get them to stop being so provocative in the region. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=34.76s)]
*  Dr. Toulouse-Denis-Garry is a former political prisoner in Iran who will speak to lawmakers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=42.08s)]
*  at that briefing today, and he joins me now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  Doctor, what's the main point you want to drive home in your comments today? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  Good morning, Todd. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=54.68s)]
*  The main point is that this regime stands on two legs. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=55.96s)]
*  One is killing and suppression of its internal people, Iranian people, like myself and my [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  family. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=65.76s)]
*  I was in jail, tortured severely. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=66.76s)]
*  And the second leg is the terrorism outside his borders. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=68.92s)]
*  I learned this morning that this regime has set up a sham court to do an in-absent trial [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=73.2s)]
*  for 104 leaders of the leading opposition group, the Mujahidin Khaldai Iran, MEK, to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=81.28s)]
*  take him to trial. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=88.96s)]
*  And I'm a biologist. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=90.68s)]
*  Let me tell you, based on what I had seen four decades ago in the jails and throughout [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=91.92s)]
*  the four decades ago, this regime is looking for a justification to increase its terroristic [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=96.42s)]
*  attacks outside its borders on Iranian citizens. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  A number of this group, about 900 opposition leaders, are in Albania, in Ashraf, a camp [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=107.2s)]
*  called Ashraf III. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=113.8s)]
*  And I think this regime is looking to hijack our court system and our legal system to justify [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=115.6s)]
*  its attacks on its opponents and in opposition outside Iran. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=122.16s)]
*  And frankly, as an American citizen, that makes me very unsafe. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=128.2s)]
*  And the message to theâ€” [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=133.56s)]
*  Let me get you a minute for a second, Doctor. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=134.56s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=136.6s)]
*  I've known since I was a child growing up in the 80s that Iran is a bad actor. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=137.1s)]
*  I feel like instinctively we all know that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=141.8s)]
*  So why has Washington led Iran, get so influential in the region and putting our own U.S. interests [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=144.88s)]
*  at risk? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=152.26s)]
*  It makes no sense, Doctor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=153.26s)]
*  You're 100 percent correct, Todd, because of the appeasement policies that have driven [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=154.96s)]
*  this administration to appease and play with this regime. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=159.04s)]
*  Remember, this regime is led by a so-called president who was a part of the death panel [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=163.76s)]
*  that ordered over 30,000 young people. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  Half of my classmates at University of Tehran were executed or missing. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  And that was led by Ebrahim Raisi, the so-called president of today's Iran. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  And Todd, this is in the view of the fact that there is a bipartisan support for the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=183.6s)]
*  group led by Mrs. Rajavi, who has presented the 10-point plans for a non-nuclear, non-violent [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=190.36s)]
*  Iran with all the elements that we have here in our own Constitution. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=197.60000000000002s)]
*  And I carry a bucket of Constitution, U.S. Constitution, in my pocket. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=202.56s)]
*  And there is a bipartisan support that actually we will hear today in the Congress. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=207.96s)]
*  There is a hearing, as you mentioned, for this support. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=212.72000000000003s)]
*  I think the time has arrived for us as Americans and for this administration to stand with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=216.44s)]
*  the opposition of Iran. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=222.96s)]
*  As you know, since 2022, the revolution has started, leading by women, by youth, to go [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=225.0s)]
*  for their support. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=231.94s)]
*  And the vote of the American, the Iranian people, is very clear. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=233.16s)]
*  Unanimously, they want a regime change in Iran. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=237.36s)]
*  And it is time for us and our policymakers and our administration to stand with Iran [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=240.4s)]
*  and stop appeasing this barbaric regime that is trying to use all the tools that it has, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  including supporting Hamas and, you know, creating more tension by its proxies in the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=252.72s)]
*  Middle East to get us engaged and sends us a message of fear. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=258.2s)]
*  Regime change is not an instantaneous thing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=263.24s)]
*  That does take time. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=265.44s)]
*  What steps can we take, starting today, Doctor, to just stop the attacks on our U.S. troops? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=266.44s)]
*  It seems like that's step one. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=271.92s)]
*  Todd, as you remember, this administration gave $6 billion as a bribe to this regime. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=275.2s)]
*  I think standing firm with the Iranian opposition, standing firm with the Iranian revolution, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  is both the short-term and long-term vision. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=291.2s)]
*  The Iranian people are ready to overthrow this regime. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=294.84000000000003s)]
*  All this administration has to do to stop appeasing with them and enforcing the sanctions. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=298.32s)]
*  Since President Trump left the office, the sale of the oil by this regime has gone through [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=305.24s)]
*  the roof becauseâ€” [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=310.28000000000003s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=311.28000000000003s)]
*  â€”Biden administration does not enforce the sanctions. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  Our number one chance is to support Iranian people to take down this regime by its main [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=315.92s)]
*  opposition group that are in Albania now. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=322.96000000000004s)]
*  And the regime, by this sham court system that is setting up, is trying to justify or [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=326.16s)]
*  hijack our legal system. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=331.56s)]
*  This is a regime that doesn't even understand what the rule of law is. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=333.66s)]
*  They're trying to hijack this system to send a message that the opposition is not [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=337.56s)]
*  going to be safe in Europe. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=343.44000000000005s)]
*  And that is, I think, our both short-term and long-term action plan. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=345.68s)]
*  Well, you mentioned it's bipartisan, but none of this matters unless the president [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=349.76000000000005s)]
*  United States, as Biden administration gets on board and stops with its hands-off lax [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=353.12s)]
*  approach to Iran. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=356.88s)]
*  They've shown no proclivity to doing so. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=357.88s)]
*  Hopefully, your words today will lead them down the path of logic. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=360.12s)]
*  Fyorush, Dinesh, Gary, we thank you for your time. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=364.04s)]
*  Thanks, doctor. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5YTGTHGzC4&t=366.84000000000003s)]
