# Laura Ingraham: Biden's team is leaking these details
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0)
*  Hateful peacemakers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=0.0s)]
*  That's the focus of tonight's angle. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=1.92s)]
*  The rule is that you don't negotiate with terrorists, right? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  You don't give them an inch because they'll take a mile. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=9.4s)]
*  In the case of Hamas, we know they'll use a lull in the fighting [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=13.24s)]
*  to burrow in, resupply, and stoke more anti-Israel sentiment worldwide. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=17.6s)]
*  To survive, Hamas needs a break in the action. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=24.0s)]
*  They know it, and Hezbollah knows it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=28.24s)]
*  Now remember, their goal is to destroy Israel, period. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  And they'll use endless pro-Palestinian propaganda to keep Hamas alive, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=34.239999999999995s)]
*  which keeps their dream of destroying the Jewish people alive. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=39.28s)]
*  And despite claiming to be staunch supporters of Israel, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  the White House is playing right into their hands. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Secretary of State Tony Blinken flew to Israel again [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  with a clear message to Netanyahu. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=52.84s)]
*  Stop. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Supposedly, they just want more time to get more hostages released. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=56.4s)]
*  Of course, we all want the hostages released. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=60.72s)]
*  But as the angle predicted, Hamas is using its hostages as bargaining chips, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  releasing a few yesterday, which the administration cited was proof [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=68.56s)]
*  that their efforts were paying off. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=72.32s)]
*  And then anonymous administration officials told CNN [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=74.92s)]
*  that in conversations with Netanyahu, Biden has warned that Israel will be [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=78.96s)]
*  harshly by the international community if it doesn't take steps [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=84.08s)]
*  to significantly ease humanitarian suffering [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=88.12s)]
*  and minimize Palestinian civilian deaths. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  Now, this is what you have to understand. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=94.36s)]
*  Biden's team is leaking these details because they know [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=96.04s)]
*  that they're losing political support at home from his pro-Palestinian voters, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=100.36s)]
*  who, as we've seen, have taken to the streets because they're trying, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=105.2s)]
*  the Biden people are, they're trying to send signals of, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=108.72s)]
*  we hear you, to the pro-Hamas wing of their own party. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=112.84s)]
*  But are Biden's calls for this temporary pause actually working? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=118.24s)]
*  Well, more from CNN. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=122.32s)]
*  Netanyahu explicitly rejected some of those calls on Friday [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=123.92s)]
*  as Blinken visited Israel and met with the Israeli War Cabinet. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=127.96s)]
*  The prime minister specifically said that his government [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=131.84s)]
*  opposed any temporary ceasefire in Gaza [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=135.28s)]
*  unless Hamas freed all the hostages it holds. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=138.84s)]
*  Well, of course, Netanyahu is making the right call [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=143.32000000000002s)]
*  for his people and the survival of his nation. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=147.4s)]
*  The idea that you can trust Hamas to have any humanitarian instincts is absurd. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=151.56s)]
*  They're still firing into Israel. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas has been using mortars to hit this area and also small rockets. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=161.28s)]
*  Just a lot of shrapnel marks on this wall. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=166.88s)]
*  You can see all of these holes here, all of this on the side of a kindergarten. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=169.72s)]
*  It's painted these colors because normally in times of war, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=173.68s)]
*  before Hamas committed the massacre against southern Israel, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=176.76s)]
*  kids were going to school here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=180.28s)]
*  This was a kindergarten that was used by this southern community. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=181.4s)]
*  Most have evacuated since then, but you can see there are still soldiers [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=185.28s)]
*  and police officers in this area because it sits just over the border [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=189.84s)]
*  from the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=193.44s)]
*  But don't expect far-left Democrats on Capitol Hill [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=196.28s)]
*  to care about what's happening and still happening to Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=198.88s)]
*  Seventeen of them signed on to a resolution by Cori Bush [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=203.32s)]
*  that reads like it could have been written by that Hezbollah leader himself, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=207.44s)]
*  calling for an immediate de-escalation and ceasefire in Israel [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=211.12s)]
*  and occupied Palestine. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=214.76s)]
*  And four other House Democrats are calling for a straight ceasefire. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=217.16s)]
*  And over in the Senate, what's happening? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=221.88s)]
*  Well, when pressed on his view of what Israel should do, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=223.32s)]
*  tricky Dick Durbin used his typical weasel words. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=226.44s)]
*  Is a ceasefire needed now? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=230.4s)]
*  I think it is, at least in the context of both sides agreeing. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  Oh, this is redicx. Ridiculous. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=239.28s)]
*  He knows that Israel is not agreeing and can agree to a ceasefire. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=241.64s)]
*  But Durbin also knows that the political price his party could pay [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=246.12s)]
*  in next year's election is significant. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=250.2s)]
*  So he's kind of trying to have it both ways there. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=252.88s)]
*  Well, when I was thinking about this today, I thought, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=256.12s)]
*  isn't it a good time to ask this question? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=258.24s)]
*  Why have Democrats taken such a different approach with the war in Ukraine? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=261.36s)]
*  It is impossible to explain to my constituency why, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=266.52s)]
*  when the Ukrainians are in the midst of fighting and dying [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=269.84s)]
*  every single day for their nation, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=272.36s)]
*  that this Congress somehow or another managed to pass a spending bill [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=273.92s)]
*  and not include more funding for the Ukrainian cause. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=277.64s)]
*  Now, where's the peacemaker? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=281.8s)]
*  Thousands of lives have been lost. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=284.04s)]
*  At least 9,000 civilians, but probably more in Ukraine, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  and hundreds of billions of dollars in damage [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=290.04s)]
*  that, you know, we're going to be called on to fix. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  And yesterday, its own defense chief in Ukraine [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=294.76s)]
*  said the situation is at a stalemate. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=298.24s)]
*  So why didn't Biden call for a humanitarian pause there at any point [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=302.44s)]
*  in the last, what, 21 months or so? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, there's plenty of suffering, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=310.48s)]
*  and more U.S. funding is only going to ensure that the suffering continues. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=312.36s)]
*  If there were ever a case where interested parties should call for a pause [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=317.92s)]
*  to conduct a negotiated settlement, Ukraine is it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=321.76s)]
*  In fact, last year, when progressives on the Hill [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  did urge Biden to negotiate with Russia, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=327.16s)]
*  boy, they were told quick to back off, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=329.8s)]
*  and they've been quiet ever since on Ukraine. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=332.32s)]
*  But with Israel, it's different. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=336.32s)]
*  Well, the truth is, the squad types don't believe [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=338.44s)]
*  Israel should be allowed to defend itself, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=340.36s)]
*  even though a month has now passed since Hamas carried out that attack [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=343.32s)]
*  slaughtering 1,400 innocent civilians. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=347.16s)]
*  Now, we should offer military advice there if asked, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=350.36s)]
*  but otherwise, stay out of this counteroffensive. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=353.64s)]
*  And the advice that we do give should not be based on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=356.68s)]
*  what Democrats' election prospects are next year. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=359.84s)]
*  But when it comes down to it, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=364.36s)]
*  Biden doesn't really have a foreign policy. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=365.8s)]
*  They have a plan for Biden's reelection. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=368.76s)]
*  And they do just whatever they think is going to help with that. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=371.76s)]
*  The White House knows the hard left hates Israel, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=375.15999999999997s)]
*  and they're afraid that the war is going to hurt them politically. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=377.32s)]
*  But the hard left likes Zelensky, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=380.4s)]
*  so that war can just go on forever, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=382.64s)]
*  as long as the Democrats are concerned, they don't care. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=384.88s)]
*  But a real president would focus on what is best for the United States. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=388.12s)]
*  Well, of course, we don't have a real president. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=393.28000000000003s)]
*  We have a figurehead president, [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=395.52s)]
*  surrounded by folks who want him reelected, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  so they can make, down the road, a lot of money as lobbyists. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=400.52s)]
*  And that's the angle. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNUtoOOY5z0&t=404.28000000000003s)]
