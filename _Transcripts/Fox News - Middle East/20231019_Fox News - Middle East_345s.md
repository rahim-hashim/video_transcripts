# Mike Pompeo on Biden's $100M pledge in aid to Palestine: 'Messed up, backwards'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4)
*  here with reaction former secretary of state and Fox News contributor our friend [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike Pompeo is back sir welcome back great to have you [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=3.84s)]
*  Mr. Secretary we're worried about a two-front war in the north [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=10.16s)]
*  Hezbollah and and Lebanon [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  and then of course Gaza now we have Iran threatening [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=17.6s)]
*  and warning Israel their time is up [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=22.64s)]
*  at that point in time [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  I know Israel would be difficult to two-front war but if Iran involves itself [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=27.3s)]
*  I would argue and correct me if I'm wrong its very existence would be hanging [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=33.14s)]
*  in the balance to me that would be a threat to the entire region and maybe [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=37.54s)]
*  the consequences even worse and I don't even want to go there [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=42.980000000000004s)]
*  how bad would that be [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=48.14s)]
*  yeah it'd be deeply dangerous Sean and and and I frankly think we're pretty [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=50.94s)]
*  close to that today [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=54.42s)]
*  I do think we have war at hand this barbarity that we saw in the southern [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=55.66s)]
*  Israeli desert we can't forget as you mentioned your opening monologue 30 [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=59.419999999999995s)]
*  Americans killed and the president states travels to Israel and doesn't [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=63.14s)]
*  mention the address to which this would be held responsible right the Islamic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=67.14s)]
*  Republic of Iran I hope that we will continue to give Israel the space and [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=70.86s)]
*  the resources it needs to do the necessary for its own people because [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=76.14s)]
*  it's necessary for Americans as well there's still American hostages being [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=80.22s)]
*  held there as well [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=83.38s)]
*  if we just if we just get Hamas that will be a good thing it will save lives [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=84.86s)]
*  it will eliminate one threat to the Jewish people in their homeland but make [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=88.46s)]
*  no mistake about it this came from Iran in spite of President Biden and his [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=92.22s)]
*  team's unwillingness to acknowledge that they underwrote it they train them they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=95.86s)]
*  prepared them there is no doubt they knew about this and it will be their [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=99.86s)]
*  decision about whether Hezbollah comes in from the north and that this is not [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=103.14s)]
*  inevitable [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=107.06s)]
*  America can deter a two-front war for Israel but it's going to require [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=107.86s)]
*  American leadership that I simply have not seen and not appeasement and the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=111.94000000000001s)]
*  fact Sean the president Biden goes there and says I'm going to give the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=115.58000000000001s)]
*  Palestinians another hundred million dollars of US taxpayer money is exactly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=118.7s)]
*  the kind of appeasement that brought us to the very day that we're sitting in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=123.18s)]
*  right here today and by the way the PA reports are that they're going to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=125.94000000000001s)]
*  reward the families of October 7th quote terrorists with money which they have [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=129.22s)]
*  done historically you're right about the hundred million dollars here's the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  problem I've been in in those tunnels that they dig with Israeli money cement [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=139.22s)]
*  electricity American money cement electricity in other words the money [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=144.78s)]
*  that we sent for infrastructure schools hospitals they use it to build tunnels [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=149.62s)]
*  to kill you know the people in Israel so why would Joe give them it's not going [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=154.74s)]
*  to go to the Palestinian people that money's going straight in Hamas pocket [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=160.22s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=164.02s)]
*  No you're exactly right just as we've been talking for years about the fact [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=165.02s)]
*  that the Obama and Biden administrations underwrote the Iranian regime they [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=170.82000000000002s)]
*  have enforced sanctions around now has some 50 60 billion dollars more than [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=174.78s)]
*  they had when we left office in January of 2021 they gave six billion dollars to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=178.46s)]
*  get five hostages back and now the Iranian should hold more hostages than [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=183.3s)]
*  they did when we paid ransom for the previous hostages this policy is all [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=187.5s)]
*  just messed up it's backwards instead of being a close ally and friend of [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=192.3s)]
*  Israel instead of recognizing that the Gulf Arab states want to find a concordat [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=196.06s)]
*  they want to find a way forward that's why we got the Abraham Accords the Biden [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=200.70000000000002s)]
*  administration cozied up with the Iranians with the Islamic Republic of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=204.06s)]
*  Iran and created the context against which the slaughter of 1,300 Israelis [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  took place let me ask you this mr. secretary I know because I spoke to you [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=211.3s)]

*  secretary of state and they wanted to be part of the conditions that would have [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkzkk31g9c4&t=273.9s)]
