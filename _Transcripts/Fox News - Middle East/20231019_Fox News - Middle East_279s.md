# Victor Davis Hanson warns America is having 'complete meltdown'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y)
*  Joining me now, Victor Davis Hanson, Hoover Institution Senior Fellow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Victor, we call it the fog of war. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=3.84s)]
*  This is the fog of a lot more than war here. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  There's enormous amount of propaganda. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=10.44s)]
*  You see it on TikTok. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=12.24s)]
*  I wouldn't doubt that the Chinese are pushing some of this. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=13.44s)]
*  But this is now a dangerous moment. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=16.56s)]
*  Do we have a serious administration to confront it? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=19.6s)]
*  Yeah, I think people in the Middle East wanted to know whether the Afghan [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  humiliation, the Putin invasion, the Chinese balloon, our open border was an aberration, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=28.48s)]
*  or did we really lose deterrence and have adopted full scale appeasement? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=34.56s)]
*  And now they look at Biden's failed Middle East effort, the idea of giving Iran $6 billion, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=38.72s)]
*  which he hasn't canceled, the restoration of money to the Palestinians. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=46.16s)]
*  And by the way, I might add the message that's going out in the Middle East is if you have a lie [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=51.6s)]
*  that the Israelis hit a hospital and you promulgate it all over the Western and the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=56.72s)]
*  Middle Eastern worlds and you get protests and the American president humiliated because he has no [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=62.16s)]
*  deterrence, then he will give you a hundred million dollar dangled. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=68.8s)]
*  And the funny thing is that in a weird way, Laura, we're basically saying to the Palestinians, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=73.44s)]
*  go kill Israeli children and women, and we're going to reward you out with a hundred million dollars. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=79.12s)]
*  And what's even worse is we're saying to the world, if that missile that was intended to kill [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=84.32s)]
*  Jewish civilians in Tel Aviv had not missed the target and accidentally hurt some or killed some [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  Palestinians, then we wouldn't even give them money, probably. We only give them money because [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=97.75999999999999s)]
*  we're paranoid, they're angry over a lie that the Israelis did something. But if it wasn't a lie and [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=102.16s)]
*  they had really killed Israelis as intended, we probably would have said, well, that's okay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=108.47999999999999s)]
*  We don't really mind that. And so it's really a morally bankrupt administration. I hate to say [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=113.44s)]
*  that because we all have to be stick together. But when you look at what they're doing to our [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=118.64s)]
*  troops in Iraq and you look at what's going on here on our campuses and in New York and even at [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=123.12s)]
*  the Capitol, you get the impression where this is much worse than 1980 with Jimmy Carter. You have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=130.16s)]
*  a complete meltdown of US deterrence throughout the world. It's very dangerous, very dangerous in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=135.6s)]
*  the next 15 months in general and specifically in the next week. And Victor, we're watching scenes [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=141.52s)]
*  of some of these protests breaking out in New York right now. So far, they seem to be peaceful, but [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=148.56s)]
*  that many people in the dark, tempers flaring. We don't know anything's possible. Victor, I want to [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=156.32000000000002s)]
*  ask about this money that Biden's going to be after tomorrow night. He's going to go to the nation with [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=162.4s)]
*  a teleprompter and he's going to say, we need this hundred billion plus, which will be 500 billion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=167.92s)]
*  before you blink, for both Ukraine and Israel. That that is critical money and we need it for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=173.6s)]
*  the stability of the world, for peace. I wouldn't be surprised if he didn't call it some type of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=182.32s)]
*  investment in the future. How will that go down with the American people? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=187.67999999999998s)]
*  I think it won't go down too well because there's such an asymmetry. We never told Ukraine, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=191.92s)]
*  there's a cycle of violence. You can't retaliate when Putin comes in. We always say discount [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=199.11999999999998s)]
*  Putin's nuclear threats. That will never happen. He would never dare. But yet Iran doesn't have the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=206.39999999999998s)]
*  bomb and we're told, be careful about Iran. They're threatening us. So there's such an asymmetry to the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=211.83999999999997s)]
*  reactions of both of these wars. We never said to the Ukrainians, we don't want you to do this. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=216.96s)]
*  When you hit an infrastructure or a bridge or something, we want you to phone civilians and [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=223.6s)]
*  get them out of the way. There's only one explanation, I'm afraid, and that is there's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=228.64s)]
*  an endemic anti-Semitism and the asymmetry that we treat our closest ally Israel versus a friend. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=232.96s)]
*  But Ukraine doesn't have the relationship and we don't apply the same restrictions on Ukraine [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=240.72s)]
*  than we do on Israel. And it makes no sense. And to ask money after these people are lying about us [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=245.68s)]
*  and it's shaking us. I don't think it's going to sell. Especially when you have a president [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=252.88s)]
*  that's incoherent and can't articulate what the proposition is and the rationale is for it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=259.68s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sf5dcLUHx9Y&t=275.68s)]
