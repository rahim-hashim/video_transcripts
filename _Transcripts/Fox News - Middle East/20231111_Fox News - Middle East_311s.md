# The US has to confront Iran or this will continue, Gen. Jack Keane warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE)
*  General Jack Keane with us right now. In general, I was thinking and honored to have you at this Veterans Day that even when [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=0.0s)]
*  we're not involved in this war, we still have US soldiers, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=7.04s)]
*  certainly the 1200 or so whose boots are on the ground there in harm's way, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=11.6s)]
*  there have been almost 50 attacks on them since the start of this war from [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=15.72s)]
*  Iranian backed entities. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=20.400000000000002s)]
*  So the threat is still there. Our response is usually pretty predictable, General. We go after [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=22.76s)]
*  these rebel groups funded by Iran and we leave it at that. What do you think? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=29.52s)]
*  Well, firstly, I just like to take a look at it strategically what is happening. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, there's a recognition among many of us in foreign policy and national security wake up every day, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=41.56s)]
*  and this is what kind of what we work on, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  that the United States has lost its ability to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  deter its adversaries. Our adversaries for the last two, three years have gotten considerably more aggressive. We did not deter Putin [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=54.24s)]
*  in Ukraine. We have not deterred the Iranians from what they're attempting to do here and using their instrument, Hamas, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  to destroy as much of Israel as they can, weaken Israel politically, isolate them [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=70.68s)]
*  geopolitically certainly, get worldwide condemnation against Israel and try to force a collapse of the government. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And certainly they are trying to drive us out of the Middle East, which has been an objective for 43 years, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=83.76s)]
*  and that's why they're attacking us, I think now 48 times since October the 7th, 83 times before that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=89.4s)]
*  But even more than that, we have President Xi, you've commented on it many times, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  we have discussed it many times as how he has stepped up his aggression [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=100.12s)]
*  against the United States, against Taiwan, against our allies and partners for the last two or three years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=105.16s)]
*  We are not deterring these adversaries. They see [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=111.72s)]
*  leadership in the United States, they believe it's weak, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=115.36s)]
*  this is their perception, and they think they can take advantage of us because the United States is generally speaking [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=117.64s)]
*  in decline and we don't have the same political will, and they look at our military and they see the facts [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=124.48s)]
*  that the military post-911 has eroded, its deterrent capability is not as strong as it used to be. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=130.8s)]
*  It's still the number one military in the world, but when you put it in certain scenarios, it is challenged. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=138.0s)]
*  All of those things are coming together here, and that is why you see the attacks continuing to accelerate [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=144.2s)]
*  against U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=150.56s)]
*  You know, despite the fact that we've tried to tell them through two airstrikes to knock it off, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=153.48s)]
*  they're not going to knock it off. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=159.68s)]
*  That's the reality of it until you put something on the table that they value more and [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=160.96s)]
*  you're willing to take some risk with that in escalation and not be afraid that it's going to start a war with Iran. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=166.72s)]
*  The 43 years of evidence suggest that Iran does not want direct confrontation with the United States. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=174.72s)]
*  That's why they've designed this brilliant strategy of using proxies in other countries, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=180.72s)]
*  terrorist organizations primarily, to attack us and drive us out of the region. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=186.16s)]
*  They don't want direct confrontation with us because that's the end of their regime. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=190.79999999999998s)]
*  But General, don't the Iranians know that we don't want a direct confrontation going after entities in Iran? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=195.6s)]
*  And that is something from which they take advantage. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=202.6s)]
*  Oh yeah, absolutely. And that's why I believe after you take down the proxies capability to attack us, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=207.92s)]
*  that you put on the table the IRGC training center, which is based in Iran, where all these proxies train. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=213.6s)]
*  The Hamas was there with 500 in September, as an example, put on the table the IRGC bases, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=220.32s)]
*  which Reagan did in the mid-80s. He took down oil platforms, he took down IRGC naval bases, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=226.56s)]
*  because they were interfering with the flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf, which is another one of their major objectives. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=232.56s)]
*  And also put the IRGC headquarters in Iran on the table. These are things that will get their attention. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=241.04s)]
*  We've had two presidents that have done this. Reagan is one. The other one is certainly President Trump, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=249.44s)]
*  when he went after the leader of the IRGC, Qudfors, who was directing the attacks against the United States [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=255.2s)]
*  and certainly targeted him and killed him. And that put them back on their heels. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=263.44s)]
*  Now, did they conduct an attack, recrimination against us? Yes, but it was a measured attack, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=268.08s)]
*  and we never heard from them since. That's under the Trump administration, I mean. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=274.0s)]
*  So yes, I think we have to confront the Iranians over this issue, or it will continue. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=278.96s)]
*  After all, we're trying to prevent Americans from being killed. And it looks like as they continue [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=285.28s)]
*  to conduct these attacks at some point, our luck is going to run out. And sadly to say, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=290.96s)]
*  we may have a tragic occurrence here. All right, General, I want to thank you very much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CraMjV9ZweE&t=296.4s)]
