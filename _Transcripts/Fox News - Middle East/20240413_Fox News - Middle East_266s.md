# 'BREATH-TAKING INCOMPETENCE': Expert blast Biden admin's foreign policy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. The U.S. warning of an imminent Iranian attack on Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=0.0s)]
*  with Joe Biden issuing his infamous one-word warning to the nation. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=5.2s)]
*  How imminent do you think an attack on Israel is from Iran, Mr. President? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  I don't want to give this secure information, but my expectation is sooner or later. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=15.76s)]
*  What is your message to Iran in this moment? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=19.68s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=22.96s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Here to react is author of the Phalanx Code, new book, retired U.S. Army Brigadier General [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=25.779999999999998s)]
*  Anthony Tata. General, thank you for being here. Don't is, so it doesn't seem that has deterred [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=30.979999999999997s)]
*  anything else. How do you expect it to play out in this particular situation? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=37.22s)]
*  Hey Pete, great to be with you. You know, I visualized Biden on his knees with his hands [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=42.5s)]
*  glass saying, please don't because it'll make me look bad, because that's really all he cares [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=47.06s)]
*  about. It's his craven breathtaking drive for political power, that it's driving U.S. foreign [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=51.46s)]
*  policies more concerned about votes in Dearborn, Michigan, than he is the safety and security of [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=57.86s)]
*  Americans and allies and partners abroad. And, you know, the utter incompetence of this administration, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  breathtaking in incompetence, has brought us to the brink of a global war with Afghanistan, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=69.7s)]
*  with Russia, Ukraine, with Israel, Hamas, and now Iran, which has been destabilizing the entire [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=75.3s)]
*  Arabian Peninsula there, which this administration refuses to say anything more than don't to. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=83.3s)]
*  They actually gave them $6 billion. They've been funding a lot of this terror that's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=92.17999999999999s)]
*  raining throughout the region. And this is what happens, Pete, when you try to have it both ways [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=97.94s)]
*  and you place the American people last instead of first. So the Israelis struck an Iranian consulate [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=103.22s)]
*  inside Syria to kill some senior Iranian leaders, a target of opportunity. And now we have to wait, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=111.14s)]
*  and this is just the accepted, okay, Iran's going to strike Israel. Could this spiral? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=118.02s)]
*  What's Iran's calculation here? Do they want to escalate with Israel and create an actual full-on [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=124.42s)]
*  war? Yeah, well, they've got a real decision to make, Irondeau's, because so far they've been [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=129.7s)]
*  very effective and happy to fight through their proxies. Now the red line, supposedly, if there [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=135.78s)]
*  is one for this administration, is whether or not Iran gets, quote-unquote, directly involved, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=142.42s)]
*  whether or not Iran—it's not enough that the Quds Force was in Syria planning to attack U.S. forces [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=148.33999999999997s)]
*  and Syria and Iraq, and Israel actually did us a favor by killing this successor to Soleimani. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  So it's a real brinksmanship game going on right now, and I have zero faith in this administration [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=163.29999999999998s)]
*  in their ability to handle the brinksmanship well, because they are, for whatever reason, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=171.54s)]
*  beholden to the Iranian mullens. They allow that Islamic radicalism to influence their decision [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=177.45999999999998s)]
*  making, and right now we need to send a strong message. Our diplomacy is so weak. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=184.18s)]
*  Annie Blinken is the worst secretary of state we've ever had, and we're not messaging—don't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=191.22s)]
*  is not a message. There needs to be a clear message that is articulating the national [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  defense strategy from this president and from the cabinet. That's the problem is I don't know that I [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=203.78s)]
*  want a strong message because it won't be clear. It may be misconceived, and it could lead [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=208.98s)]
*  to escalation. We've only got a few moments here, General. As you look around the world, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=213.78s)]
*  what concerns you most? We've got potentially six months left of this administration. What's most [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=217.7s)]
*  worrisome? Yeah, this is really a dangerous six months because they're so craven for political [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=223.78s)]
*  power. They'll do anything to maintain it. They missed intelligence in Afghanistan. They missed [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=229.85999999999999s)]
*  intelligence in Ukraine. They missed it in Israel. What's most concerning to me is what have they [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=234.5s)]
*  missed on the border that they've allowed to be wide open, and how's that going to manifest itself? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=239.14s)]
*  That's exactly right. Right here at home. While they're doing all that other stuff, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=243.7s)]
*  they left our back door wide open. Anthony Tata, General, thank you so much. Congrats on the new [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=246.5s)]
*  book, The Phalanx Code. Everybody check it out. Thanks, Pete. You got it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=251.38s)]
*  Analysis. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PmACyM2gqb4&t=264.5s)]
