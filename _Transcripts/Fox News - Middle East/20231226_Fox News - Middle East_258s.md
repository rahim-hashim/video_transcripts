*  Hey Mike good morning. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=52.68s)]
*  Overnight President Biden ordered the U.S. military to strike a series of targets belonging [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=53.68s)]
*  to Iran backed militants in Iraq. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=58.64s)]
*  We do know according to U.S. Central Command that three different strikes took place and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=61.2s)]
*  they destroyed the targeted facilities and likely killed a number of Qatayp Hezbollah [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=66.4s)]
*  militants. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=70.68s)]
*  The air strikes came in response to a drone attack against the Erbil airbase that houses [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=71.72s)]
*  U.S. service members. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=76.12s)]
*  Three Americans were injured in that attack one critically. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=77.68s)]
*  This does bring the total number of attacks against American interests in the Middle East [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=80.52s)]
*  to 103 since mid-October. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=83.92s)]
*  It also comes as Israeli forces remain on high alert in the northern part of their country [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=86.47999999999999s)]
*  after an air strike yesterday in Syria killed IRGC commander Sayed Razit Mosavi. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=90.84s)]
*  In response to that strike Iranian President Ibrahim Raisi said quote the act is a sign [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  of the Zionist regime frustration and weakness in the region for which it will certainly [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=101.0s)]
*  pay the price. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=105.36s)]
*  Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant speaking this morning addressing Israeli politicians [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=107.08s)]
*  saying this about the situation. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=111.84s)]
*  We are in a multi-front war and are coming under attack from seven different threats [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=114.4s)]
*  Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Judea and Samaria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=119.0s)]
*  We have already responded and taken action in six of these threats and I say here in [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=125.2s)]
*  the most explicit way anyone who acts against us is a potential target. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=131.04s)]
*  There is no immunity for anyone. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=136.24s)]
*  Now the possibility of a broader war with Iran comes as a top advisor to Israeli Prime [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=141.4s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=146.36s)]
*  A man named Ron Dermer is reportedly in the United States today to speak with the Biden [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=147.72s)]
*  administration about the next steps for the war in Gaza. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=152.4s)]
*  Mike. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=155.96s)]
*  So Trey, Prime Minister Netanyahu laid out in the Wall Street Journal kind of the conditions [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=156.96s)]
*  for peace to take place talking about once Hamas is destroyed, Gaza demilitarized and [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=162.8s)]
*  Palestinian society can begin a deradicalization process, then you can rebuild and perhaps [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=168.32000000000002s)]
*  look forward toward peace. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=174.4s)]
*  Is that signaling to the world that this is going to take a long time? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=176.12s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=180.16s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the country's Defense Minister Yoav Galant [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=183.36s)]
*  have tried to really set the bar quite high for how long this military operation inside [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  Gaza is going to take. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=192.56s)]
*  They are describing this as at least several months, if not a number of years, when you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=194.32000000000002s)]
*  break down the next phases of this operation. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=198.86s)]
*  You won't see active phases of fighting throughout the entirety of the process, but you will [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=201.86s)]
*  likely see Israeli forces operating on the ground inside Gaza even once the hostages [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=206.16000000000003s)]
*  are released or found and they go after Hamas leadership. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=211.58s)]
*  They want to stabilize the security situation, ensure that southern Israel is not facing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=214.8s)]
*  renewed threats from factions inside Gaza, and ultimately transition in a likely Palestinian-led [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=219.24s)]
*  government that does not have one goal in mind, destroying the Jewish state. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=225.24s)]
*  The issue for the Israelis is not just Gaza, though. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  It's also the West Bank because when you look at the factions inside Gaza, like Hamas and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=232.62s)]
*  Islamic Jihad, they also have thousands of fighters across the West Bank. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=236.28s)]
*  It's part of the reason you've seen nightly Israeli raids inside the West Bank, including [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=240.52s)]
*  last night in the city of Tolkotim, where Israeli forces were engaging Palestinian gunmen [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=245.04s)]
*  trying to hit as many of those militant cells as possible. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=250.32s)]
*  Mike. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=253.48s)]
*  Trey Yanks live in Tel Aviv. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=254.48s)]
*  Trey, many thanks. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5qfyCctn78s&t=256.08s)]
