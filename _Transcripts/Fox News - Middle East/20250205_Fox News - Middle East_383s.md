# 'SHOCKWAVE': Trump lays out plan to take over, rebuild Gaza Strip
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k)
*  President Trump laying out a historic plan for the Gaza Strip during his press conference [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=0.0s)]
*  with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday that could be a step towards peace [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=6.0s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=10.86s)]
*  I do see a long-term ownership position and I see it bringing great stability to that [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=12.94s)]
*  part of the Middle East and maybe the entire Middle East and everybody I've spoken to, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=19.86s)]
*  this was not a decision made lightly. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=25.04s)]
*  I think this is an idea that's gotten tremendous and I'm talking about from the highest level [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=27.38s)]
*  of leadership, gotten tremendous praise and if the United States can help to bring stability [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=32.62s)]
*  and peace in the Middle East, we'll do that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=38.4s)]
*  Wisconsin Congressman Derek Van Orden joins me now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=40.9s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=43.26s)]
*  This is a very unique suggestion, ownership of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=45.1s)]
*  So what do you think about this and how would this work? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=48.5s)]
*  Well, this is what I think. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=51.74s)]
*  Strip can mean a lot of stuff and what President Trump is clearly articulated is that there [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=53.98s)]
*  has to be a change in the Middle East. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  So does this mean a U.S. base in the Middle East? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  Does this mean a real estate company developing the Gaza Strip? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=63.86s)]
*  I'm not really sure but what this has done has sent a shockwave across the Middle East [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=66.98s)]
*  telling everybody that the United States is going to be actively involved in making sure [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=72.18s)]
*  first and foremost that Israel is safe and that we have peace and stability in the Middle [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=75.97999999999999s)]
*  East. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=79.5s)]
*  And yesterday he said that it could take U.S. troops on the ground in the region. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=80.5s)]
*  All possibilities appear to still be on the table. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=86.58s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=90.06s)]
*  I think it's very important that the people that hate Israel and the United States understand [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=92.18s)]
*  that everything is always on the table. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=97.94s)]
*  That's from peace negotiation to a very strong and stern military reaction to what they're [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=101.1s)]
*  doing in the region. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=108.3s)]
*  So President Trump is projecting strategic strength, which is exactly what President [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=111.1s)]
*  Biden did not do for four years. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=116.5s)]
*  That's why we're here right now. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=118.53999999999999s)]
*  So something's going to change. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=120.3s)]
*  We're going to bring peace and stability back to the Middle East to make sure that our closest [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=122.1s)]
*  ally there, Israel, is safe and that our allies, the other allies in the region, start making [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=126.02s)]
*  sure that they respect the United States for what we are, which is the most powerful nation [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=131.57999999999998s)]
*  in the entire world. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=135.74s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly is. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=136.74s)]
*  I just think it's a fascinating suggestion. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=137.74s)]
*  You see this one glimmer of, well, if everybody could get on board with this, Israel would [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=139.38s)]
*  be more secure, Palestinians would be out of a war zone, and there would be regional [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=144.22s)]
*  stability, which is clearly what Donald Trump wants. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=148.18s)]
*  It would also potentially take the Palestinians agreeing to leave the region, or many of them, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=152.34s)]
*  and also for other countries in that area, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Qatar, to agree to take [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  them in to clear out some of the people so that the Gaza Strip could be rebuilt. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=164.9s)]
*  The only issue with that is that Saudi Arabia is not on board with this idea. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=169.16s)]
*  They posted this on X, saying the foreign ministry affirms that Saudi Arabia's position [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=173.28s)]
*  on the establishment of a Palestinian state is firm and unwavering, and establishing, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=177.8s)]
*  Congressman, diplomatic ties with Israel would also depend on this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=183.92s)]
*  So yesterday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he does think that the two countries [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=187.6s)]
*  could normalize relations, but man, it does look like that still is going to be a big challenge. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=192.32s)]
*  Well, let's remember, before October 7th, there was de facto a Palestinian state. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=198.68s)]
*  There was. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=204.76s)]
*  And the Palestinians allowed Hamas to take over. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=205.76s)]
*  Hamas attacked Israel in the most brutal fashion since World War II. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=209.2s)]
*  It was essentially a 21st century Holocaust. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=212.32s)]
*  And Saudi Arabia needs to understand something. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=215.56s)]
*  The 1967 Green Line, the border, is unacceptable. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=217.72s)]
*  That exposes Israel in a way that is simply not going to happen, because when you close [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=221.18s)]
*  those borders, the proximity of Israel is so much smaller than people here in the United [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=227.96s)]
*  States understand. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=231.8s)]
*  So Israel doesn't deserve to live in peace. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=232.8s)]
*  They deserve to live in peace and prosperity and security. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=236.44s)]
*  We've got to understand that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=239.52s)]
*  So Saudi Arabia is going to get on board. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  They will. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=243.32000000000002s)]
*  If people haven't learned anything from the last couple weeks of President Trump in office, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  they need to open their eyes. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=248.56s)]
*  So Mexico's on board. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=249.64000000000001s)]
*  They didn't want to be on board. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=250.96s)]
*  Canada's on board. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=251.96s)]
*  Didn't want to be on board. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=252.96s)]
*  Colombia's on board. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=253.96s)]
*  They didn't want to be on board. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=254.96s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's going to get on board. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=255.96s)]
*  How about that? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=257.52000000000004s)]
*  You mentioned peace and prosperity for Israel. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=258.52000000000004s)]
*  One piece of that, probably the biggest piece, is Iran. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=261.52000000000004s)]
*  And there was major news on that front. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=264.8s)]
*  United States going back to the maximum pressure campaign of the first Trump term. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=266.56s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=271.6s)]
*  They also took action to restore a maximum pressure policy on the Iranian regime. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=272.6s)]
*  And we will once again enforce the most aggressive possible sanctions, drive Iranian oil exports [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  to zero and diminish the regime's capacity to fund tariffs. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=284.44s)]
*  We're both committed to rolling back Iran's aggression in the region and ensuring that [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=289.04s)]
*  Iran never develops a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=294.08s)]
*  So President Trump feels like this worked last time. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=296.8s)]
*  Will it work this time around? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=298.88s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=300.8s)]
*  I mean, so what we have is the ability to look back in his first term when Iran was [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=301.8s)]
*  on their knees. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=308.08s)]
*  have a nuclear weapon, period, because they will use it. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=310.11999999999995s)]
*  And they respond to pressure just like everybody else does. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=314.4s)]
*  So what they're not going to get is the Obama pallets full of cash. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=317.76s)]
*  They're not going to get to Joe Biden relaxing these sanctions. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=322.32s)]
*  What they're going to get is what they deserve right now, as a rogue regime. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=325.02s)]
*  And that is nothing from the international community, period. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=328.11999999999995s)]
*  So cut off all their sales of oil. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=331.0s)]
*  If they try to accelerate the process again to get a nuclear weapon, then we're going [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=334.56s)]
*  to have to deal with that in a different way, because I'm going to say this one more time. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=339.44s)]
*  Iran can never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=343.48s)]
*  And President Trump is doing a fantastic job. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  Pete is in, along with Mike Walz, his national security adviser, and those guys are going [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=348.28000000000003s)]
*  to make sure that we have peace and stability and that Iran adheres to international norms. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=352.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=357.0s)]
*  And the president said yesterday that if he is assassinated by Iran, he left instructions, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=358.0s)]
*  they will be obliterated. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=361.76s)]
*  Leaving instructions is another major headline that he made yesterday. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=362.76s)]
*  Congressman, we have to leave it there. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=366.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us, Congressman Derek Van Orden, great state of Wisconsin. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=368.24s)]
*  We appreciate you and your insight. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfLem_HAO6k&t=371.36s)]
