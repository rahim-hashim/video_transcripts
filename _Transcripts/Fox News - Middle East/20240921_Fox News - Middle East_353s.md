# Former CIA chief issues grim reality check on the Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY)
*  Alicia, thanks for more on the impact of the latest Israeli operations. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us now, former CIA Chief of Station and Fox News contributor Dan Hoffman. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=4.54s)]
*  Dan, you heard Nate's great report there talking about the strikes overnight, and I found it [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  very interesting. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=17.26s)]
*  The IDF earlier this morning tweeted out really who all has been removed. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=18.94s)]
*  You can see it there. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=25.38s)]
*  You zoom in on that graph a little bit. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=26.38s)]
*  You can see the most recent, Abraham Akil, which we'll get to in a moment, the mastermind, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=28.42s)]
*  one of the masterminds behind the 1983 attack on our barracks, but also Fuad Shakur, killed [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=33.800000000000004s)]
*  a few months ago, and a lot of the other leaders within the structure of Hezbollah's military [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=40.300000000000004s)]
*  chain of command. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=46.46s)]
*  What do you make of this? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=47.92s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of the news coverage, and rightly so, has focused on this extraordinary [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=50.14s)]
*  intelligence success that Israel has achieved by that pager operation killing Hezbollah [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=56.14s)]
*  terrorists and the follow-on two-way radio operation precision strikes. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=63.34s)]
*  But really Israel has a strategy here, and I think it's becoming very clear that what [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=69.58s)]
*  Israel wants to do is remove key Hezbollah leadership from the battlefield as well as [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=74.5s)]
*  their fighters. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=79.84s)]
*  Secondly, they have destroyed Hezbollah's line of communications, creating a fog of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=81.3s)]
*  war, making it more difficult for Hezbollah to defend themselves and to launch attacks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=86.38s)]
*  And then I think the third thing that Israel has done very effectively is to target kinetically [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=91.5s)]
*  Hezbollah's rocket launch sites. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  What they're doing is trying to gain escalation dominance and deter a wider war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=98.72s)]
*  However, if they're not successful in doing that, they're ready to fight that war against [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=104.14s)]
*  a Hezbollah that is going to be less effective because of all these attacks, successful attacks [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=108.46000000000001s)]
*  that Israel has mounted. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=114.14s)]
*  Dan, many are saying that we're getting awfully close to that full-scale war. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=115.54s)]
*  How do you see it? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=121.14s)]
*  Are we on the precipice of that? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=122.22s)]
*  I don't think that Hezbollah wants that war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=126.62s)]
*  They'd lose it, and Iran certainly doesn't want a conventional war that would risk their [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=129.06s)]
*  regime security as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=134.22s)]
*  And Israel knows that, and that's how they are factoring in their strategic decision-making. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=137.14s)]
*  But what we also know is that Hezbollah has been launching 50 to 70 rocket attacks every [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=143.42s)]
*  day, which forced the evacuation of 60, 70,000 Israelis from those northern communities. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  That's just not tenable anymore. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=154.42s)]
*  It's devastating Israel's economy, and Israel rightly made the decision that they need to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=155.98s)]
*  take the fight to the enemy now. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=160.54s)]
*  And they're not getting a lot of help from the United States. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=163.18s)]
*  They're just seeking de-escalation, but I don't think that's going to get to the root [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=166.54s)]
*  of the problem. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=170.54s)]
*  And you mentioned de-escalation. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=172.45999999999998s)]
*  If you look at the big picture for just a moment, in the 30,000-foot view for a second, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=176.94s)]
*  Dan, Hezbollah is clearly Iran's strongest militia force they have. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=182.22s)]
*  And now Israel has proven that they have greatly weakened and diminished its capabilities. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=188.94s)]
*  What do you make of the message being sent to Iran right now, and why isn't the U.S. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=195.38s)]
*  a stronger part of that? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=201.34s)]
*  Yeah, I think we could do more, for example, against the Houthis, who continue to disrupt [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=203.94s)]
*  trade in the Red Sea. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=209.66s)]
*  We could take a page out of Israel's book and do more to counter those attacks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=210.66s)]
*  Right now we're simply destroying Houthi drones and missile attacks, but we're not getting [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=217.18s)]
*  to the root of that problem either. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=223.7s)]
*  Look, this is going to carry on and continue until we gain that escalation dominance. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=225.94s)]
*  And when all we talk about is de-escalating, there's a slippery slope there to appeasement [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  and not, again, getting to what the root of the problem is here. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=237.23999999999998s)]
*  And we need to stand up and be strong along with our ally. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=241.45999999999998s)]
*  For those old enough to remember history, I want to remind people that it was on the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=246.38s)]
*  anniversary, September 20th, that Israel killed Ibrahim Aqeel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=251.82s)]
*  He was one of the masterminds of the September 10th, 1983 attacks on our marine barracks [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  in Beirut that killed 17. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=264.82s)]
*  This is the image, Nancy and Ronald Reagan walking in 1983 along those flag-draped coffins. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=267.94s)]
*  And it strikes me, Dan, there's a reflection here that Israel settled this score. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=275.58s)]
*  It wasn't the Biden administration. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=282.22s)]
*  It wasn't the U.S. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=284.1s)]
*  Yeah, they kind of settled that score on our behalf. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=286.1s)]
*  I don't know how many times, if at all, we had opportunities to find and fix and finish [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=289.34s)]
*  Aqeel, as we did with other terrorists with American blood on their hands, like Osama [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=295.1s)]
*  Bin Laden or Zawahiri in Afghanistan. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=300.22s)]
*  But I think nothing really reflects the fact that we've outsourced our counterterrorism [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=305.3s)]
*  operations in that region to Israel more than this recent very successful kinetic strike. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=309.54s)]
*  And again, Aqeel was on the U.S. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=316.46000000000004s)]
*  government most wanted list, and it was Israel who took that shot. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=318.66s)]
*  That indeed, in the last 20 seconds I've got left, where do you see this situation a week [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=322.86s)]
*  from today, a month from today? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=329.02s)]
*  It's awfully hard to speculate. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=333.1s)]
*  I can tell you, I spent a lot of time in the Middle East. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=334.54s)]
*  And one of the things that some Iraqi partners used to tell me is that, you know, today was [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=337.22s)]
*  a pretty rough day, but at least tomorrow will be a lot worse. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=342.42s)]
*  And I fear that's where we're headed. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=346.14000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=348.06s)]
*  Dan Hoffman, always great insight. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=349.06s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7s4TMRcOhY&t=350.86s)]
