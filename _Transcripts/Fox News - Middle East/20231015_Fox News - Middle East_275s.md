**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58)
*  We started, as you know, in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=0.0s)]
*  And it was important to make it very clear that the United States has Israel's back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=5.28s)]
*  We will stand with it today, tomorrow and every day. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=11.28s)]
*  And we begin with this Fox News alert. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=17.0s)]
*  There you have it, just moments ago, Secretary of State Antony Blinken on the tarmac in Cairo, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=18.8s)]
*  Egypt, saying we will stand with Israel today, tomorrow and every day, also doubling down [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=24.52s)]
*  that Israel has the right to defend itself against Hamas terrorists this just one week [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=31.8s)]
*  since Hamas launched their devastating attack on Israel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=37.480000000000004s)]

*  Israeli forces are calling for civilians to leave northern Gaza as they prepare for what's [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=45.56s)]

*  ally, that raising concerns since the terrorist group has not only killed Israelis but also [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=65.34s)]
*  Americans. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  Yet Qatar in Doha won't touch them or close that office. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=72.46000000000001s)]
*  As you know, Iran is a big financial backer of Hamas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=77.54s)]

*  Israeli defense forces repeatedly telling more than 1.1 million civilians there to evacuate [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=89.10000000000001s)]

*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=111.7s)]
*  It's a measure in order to safeguard human life. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=112.9s)]
*  We are doing everything possible so that civilians will not be hurt. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=117.1s)]
*  They are in a war zone. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=121.78s)]
*  They have become human shields. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=124.62s)]
*  Hamas made them into human shields. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=127.1s)]

*  But first, Trey Yanks has the very latest on the ground in Israel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=143.46s)]
*  Trey? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=147.1s)]
*  Eric, good afternoon. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=148.1s)]
*  As we speak, there are air raid sirens sounding in central Israel. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=151.1s)]
*  The Israeli military has been using rockets of one direct impact of a rocket around the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=155.66s)]
*  country's main airport, the Ben Gurion airport just outside of Tel Aviv. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=161.1s)]
*  All of this as we can hear drones in the distance overhead. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=165.26s)]
*  Along the Gaza Strip, the Israelis continue to strike targets ahead of an expected ground [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=168.22s)]
*  operation. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=173.3s)]
*  And today we are getting new information on the types of weapons that Hamas fighters have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=174.3s)]
*  brought into southern Israel during that massacre last weekend. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=178.38s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=181.94s)]
*  The Israeli military in the southern part of their country, they say they found about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=184.94s)]
*  a thousand of these brought in by Hamas fighters to use against Israeli communities along the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=188.66s)]
*  border. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=194.22s)]
*  This arsenal here just accounts for about 20 percent of what was recovered. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=195.66s)]
*  Hamas planned to battle for days and the Israelis say most of this is homemade. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=199.74s)]
*  They don't see any evidence of outside help but are prepared for what they will face inside [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=205.22s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=209.74s)]
*  Homemade explosive is very common in the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=210.74s)]
*  They have factories of this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=214.9s)]
*  They walk around the clock in order to make new IEDs, new charges against our troops. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=216.18s)]
*  The troops of Hamas, RPG-7 VR. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=221.66s)]
*  This is the tubes of those RPGs. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=227.22s)]
*  This is the tube of the thermobaric missile rocket in here. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=229.26s)]
*  Wow. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=235.02s)]
*  So you can see all of these made inside Gaza by groups there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=236.02s)]
*  And this is some of what the Israeli forces will face when they enter the Strip. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=240.46s)]
*  I believe that they have about five times more at the Gaza Strip but it's good to know [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=244.74s)]
*  that we know all these and we have nothing to surprise us. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=250.34s)]
*  The more we learn about the massacre, the more questions arise about what comes next. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=257.3s)]
*  Today in northern Israel there were five separate anti-tank guided missiles fired toward Israeli [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=261.1s)]
*  troops and civilians. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=266.82s)]
*  These all fired by Lebanon's militant group Hezbollah. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=268.54s)]
*  Eric? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=271.18s)]
*  All right, Trey, on the ground in southern Israel. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=272.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qGYOdP_2f58&t=274.34s)]
