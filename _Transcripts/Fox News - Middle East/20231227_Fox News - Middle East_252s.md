# Keith Kellogg: If the Biden admin doesn't act, this will spin out of control
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4)
*  Molly, let's bring in retired U.S. Army Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=0.0s)]
*  General, welcome. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=4.0s)]
*  So now the United States Navy is dealing with ballistic missile attacks from the Houthis, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=6.0s)]
*  what a senior defense official is calling a significant escalation in the region. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=10.84s)]
*  What is your reaction? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=15.44s)]
*  Yeah, Mike, look, first of all, thanks for having me today. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=16.44s)]
*  Look, we're seeing a lot of rhetoric come out of the administration and very little [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=19.36s)]
*  limited response, both to the attacks in the Red Sea and attack actually with the Houthis [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=23.18s)]
*  launching their missiles. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=28.74s)]
*  And if you look at the whole region, if you back out a minute, the concern I've got is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=30.36s)]
*  this has set an incredibly bad pattern. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=34.26s)]
*  All of us set patterns in our lives in how we do things. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=37.54s)]
*  This administration set a pattern of talking a lot but not doing a lot. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=41.379999999999995s)]
*  I don't care if it's Ukraine and Russia. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=45.980000000000004s)]
*  I don't care if it's the Far East. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=48.3s)]
*  I don't care if it's the Mideast. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=49.86s)]
*  And I don't care if it's right now in the Red Sea. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=51.84s)]
*  They're going to have to take some pretty strong responses, especially with what's happening [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=54.26s)]
*  with the Houthis now in Yemen. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=58.18s)]
*  And if they don't take that, it just compounds itself. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=60.02s)]
*  My experience being in the White House, when situations like this occur, if you don't respond [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=62.46s)]
*  aggressively and take disproportionate responses, then it's just going to build. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=67.26s)]
*  And it's harder to put it back in the box. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=71.42s)]
*  And right now, there's a lot of things out of the box. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=73.66s)]
*  We're talking a big game, but we're not doing very much. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=77.34s)]
*  And here's the concern I've got when you look at it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=79.86s)]
*  You're seeing a lot of allies kind of saying, we hear you, but we're really not listening [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  to you. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=85.7s)]
*  We're looking at what's happening with the protection of the Red Sea. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=86.7s)]
*  The Italians have gone their own way. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=90.86s)]
*  The Spanish have gone their own way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=92.54s)]
*  The French have gone their own way. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=94.18s)]
*  And now that even though some of the fleets, the major shipping fleets are putting ships [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=95.94s)]
*  back into the Red Sea, they're being very, very cautious. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=100.94s)]
*  And the reason for that is you really don't trust us. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=103.34s)]
*  Florida Republican Congressman Mike Walz, a combat veteran, is raising this concern. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=105.34s)]
*  Let's play it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  I think it tells us and our adversaries and our allies loud and clear that deterrence [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=110.82000000000001s)]
*  is failing. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=116.26s)]
*  We have put significant assets in the region, air defense assets, bombers, an additional [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=117.26s)]
*  aircraft carrier, and now have a multinational coalition of ships in the Red Sea. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=122.94000000000001s)]
*  And yet the attacks keep continuing. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=129.02s)]
*  So how should the president and the Pentagon respond? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=132.1s)]
*  Well, what I mean, Mike, they need to do something disproportionate. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=134.66s)]
*  And we need to go way out of the box to bring it back into the box. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=137.9s)]
*  And just protecting the shipping through missile defense is wrong. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=141.02s)]
*  They're going to have to go to the source of the problem. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=146.06s)]
*  The source of the problem, one is in Yemen. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=147.58s)]
*  And the second is Iran. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=149.74s)]
*  When you look at what's happening with Khatib Hezbollah in Iraq right now, of attacking [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=151.08s)]
*  U.S. servicemen, what you're seeing the Houthis doing, the Houthis are not doing this on their [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=155.70000000000002s)]
*  own. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=159.58s)]
*  They're being supplied by the Iranians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=160.58s)]
*  The Iraq paramilitary forces are being supplied by the Iranians. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=161.9s)]
*  You look at Hamas, you look at Hezbollah, all backed by the Iranians. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=164.94s)]
*  Those are hard choices. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=168.3s)]
*  I know the risk involved. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=169.38s)]
*  I know it's hard to do that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=170.74s)]
*  But if they don't take a response and they don't make a hard response, this is going [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=172.18s)]
*  to continue and the trouble is going to spin way out of control and just not in the region, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=175.73999999999998s)]
*  but globally as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=180.14s)]
*  From the Wall Street Journal editorial board, Biden endangers U.S. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=181.45999999999998s)]
*  troops, quote, Mr. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=185.1s)]
*  Biden is afraid. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=186.6s)]
*  We use that word advisedly of being involved in a larger conflict, which might not be [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=187.78s)]
*  popular in an election year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=192.04s)]
*  But that anxiety is now interfering with his core obligation to defend U.S. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=194.06s)]
*  forces. Is the president too worried about war with Iran? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=198.7s)]
*  Yeah, it's a pattern. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  And he set the pattern. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=205.22s)]
*  It's risk avoidance. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=206.66s)]
*  And you have to be willing to accept risk. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=208.06s)]
*  You know, when you're inside the White House, those decisions come at you really fast and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=210.17999999999998s)]
*  really hard. And you have to understand escalation control. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=213.78s)]
*  You have to understand risk. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=216.45999999999998s)]
*  But you have to do it. Your job is to protect the nation, to protect America's troops [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=217.7s)]
*  abroad. And they're not doing it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=221.32s)]
*  And so he has now set a pattern. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=222.94s)]
*  And your adversaries see this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=224.54s)]
*  Your adversaries are not Jeffersonian Democrats. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=226.17999999999998s)]
*  They're despots. They're authoritarian leaders. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  They're dictators. They're terrorists. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=231.42s)]
*  And you must respond accordingly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=233.26s)]
*  The American people expect that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  And our nation has to respond hard to bring this thing back under control. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=236.57999999999998s)]
*  Right now, he's not doing it. And I think it's actually almost too late. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=240.98s)]
*  Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg with some sobering advice, analysis. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=244.7s)]
*  Thank you for your time and your analysis today, sir. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=248.85999999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Mike. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2IZOZBu1z4&t=250.78s)]
