# The situation in Afghanistan is 'literally heartbreaking': Mast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q)
*  All right, 28 minutes before the top of the hour, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Vice President Kamala Harris comparing the January 6 attacks [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=1.52s)]
*  on the U.S. Capitol to some of the worst tragedies [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  in American history. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=7.04s)]
*  Certain dates echo throughout history. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=9.72s)]
*  December 7th, 1941, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=12.4s)]
*  September 11th, 2001, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=15.88s)]
*  and January 6th, 2021. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=19.66s)]
*  Well, they all ended in one. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=23.48s)]
*  That's how they're similar. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  Does it end there? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  Retired Army Ranger and Florida Congressman Brian Mass [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  joins us now. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  Congressman, do you think the analogy works? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  I think she's just strictly historically ignorant, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=35.0s)]
*  tactically illiterate. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  She has no reference point of any of this. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=40.0s)]
*  When you look at making a comparison like that, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=42.72s)]
*  there were bad actors on January 6th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=45.160000000000004s)]
*  Nobody's gonna deny that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=46.96s)]
*  But the tens of thousands of Americans [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  that were there at the Capitol [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  to exercise one of their five basic freedoms [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=52.72s)]
*  that America is all about, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  to assemble and to petition their government, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=58.0s)]
*  to compare them to Japanese kamikaze pilots [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=60.76s)]
*  or Saudi Arabian suicide pilots, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=64.32s)]
*  to make that comparison about patriotic Americans [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=67.48s)]
*  and to think what? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=70.72s)]
*  They were staging, that was their launching point [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=71.56s)]
*  to stage what they call an insurrection with what? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=75.4s)]
*  Trump flags and the red, white, and blue. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=78.32s)]
*  It's so illiterate and ignorant [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=81.03999999999999s)]
*  to make this comparison. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  It's disgusting. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=84.32s)]
*  It is. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=85.16s)]
*  And then you watch the President of the United States [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=85.98s)]
*  give a, sound like a partisan address in the Capitol [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=88.06s)]
*  where he basically was calling out Donald Trump [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=90.74s)]
*  and re-litigating the election. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  I thought that was 100% inappropriate, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=94.53999999999999s)]
*  especially he's supposed to be the great unifier. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=97.02s)]
*  Did you feel a sense of unity after those remarks? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=99.22s)]
*  Zero unity. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=102.58s)]
*  I think I felt what I felt this entire year [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=103.66s)]
*  from the Biden administration, Harris, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=107.02s)]
*  all of their propaganda enablers in the media [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=109.62s)]
*  and everybody else. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=112.5s)]
*  I think you could sum them up in one word [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=113.34s)]
*  and that would be hypocrisy. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  That's what this whole administration is about. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  They're gonna call January 6th, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=118.86s)]
*  all of these things an insurrection. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=120.38000000000001s)]
*  Nobody's been charged with insurrection by the way, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=121.88000000000001s)]
*  but they're gonna forget that hundreds were arrested [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=124.22s)]
*  between the Supreme Court and the Senate [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  during the Kavanaugh confirmation hearings [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=129.02s)]
*  or that the White House in the summer of 2020 [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=131.82s)]
*  was surrounded, literally surrounded by BLM [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=134.86s)]
*  with hundreds of members of Congress [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=138.28s)]
*  on the White House grounds. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=139.9s)]
*  And many of them attacked like Rand Paul [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=141.22s)]
*  as they were leaving the White House. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=143.1s)]
*  That wasn't an insurrection. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=145.26s)]
*  Or they're gonna forget about the four months [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=146.78s)]
*  or five months, six months of anarchy and burning cities [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=148.82s)]
*  and you can't go in certain parts of Portland. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=152.66s)]
*  None of those things happened. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=154.94s)]
*  It's all summed up with the word hypocrisy. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=156.26s)]
*  And I remember you being surrounded, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=159.14s)]
*  leaving the White House after the Presidents, the RNC. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=160.34s)]
*  They were all over you. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=164.38s)]
*  I thought you were gonna get attacked, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=165.38s)]
*  but you were unflappable. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=166.7s)]
*  They kept their distance because I think they realized [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=167.94s)]
*  I'd actually dispatched them from the school. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=170.66s)]
*  You would kick their head in. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=172.26s)]
*  Meanwhile, we trained 20,000 Afghan commandos at least [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=173.6s)]
*  and we're waiting for them to fight, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=177.84s)]
*  but when it was clear they were outmatched, outgunned, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=179.0s)]
*  they wanted to hiding. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=182.24s)]
*  They're now asking for help. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=184.28s)]
*  They're asking lawmakers and others [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=186.12s)]
*  to help them get out of Afghanistan. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  What do you think we should do after that utter embarrassment, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  the biggest embarrassment in the history [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=194.74s)]
*  of American military operations? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=196.84s)]
*  What do we do with the commandos? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=199.2s)]
*  What we owe them? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=201.68s)]
*  I don't even have words to do the calculation [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=203.48000000000002s)]
*  of what we owe them. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=206.28s)]
*  Standing alongside of us, putting in their hearts [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=207.12s)]
*  what a real country can be like with those things [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=210.84s)]
*  like those five basic freedoms [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  that we enjoy here in America, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=216.28s)]
*  to understand that they could have freedom of religion [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=218.08s)]
*  and press and speech and to petition their government [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  and all of these things, to teach them about those things [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=223.88000000000002s)]
*  and then snatch them away from them, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=226.56s)]
*  to teach them how to fight for those things [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=228.0s)]
*  in real tactical ways and then say, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=230.04s)]
*  we're gonna turn our back and we're gonna make new friends [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  with your sworn enemy that we've been fighting [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=234.6s)]
*  for the last 20 years. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=236.48s)]
*  We need to get them out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=237.6s)]
*  This administration is doing nothing to do so [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  and it's literally heartbreaking. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=241.95999999999998s)]
*  When I say heartbreaking, it is heartbreaking [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  to so many of my fellow veterans, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=247.32s)]
*  the way they carry this on their shoulders [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=249.38s)]
*  is like nothing I've ever seen. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=251.07999999999998s)]
*  Please call a press conference over the next few, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=252.28s)]
*  maybe today's not good because of the snow, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=254.12s)]
*  but call a press conference because we'll cover it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=256.15999999999997s)]
*  These people are dying. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=259.6s)]
*  They're being hanged. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  They're being murdered. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=262.20000000000005s)]
*  Their families, if they can't find them, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=263.36s)]
*  they're killing their families. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  And this administration, you're not allowed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=266.5s)]
*  to bring up the word Afghanistan in the White House. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  Real quick, guess what? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  We lost about another two dozen Navy personnel [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=271.48s)]
*  because they didn't get vaccinated. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  We lost about 30 Marines. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=277.44s)]
*  We're about to lose hundreds more. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=279.64000000000004s)]
*  Navy SEALs are suing to stay in and so far they've stayed, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=282.04s)]
*  they're allowed to stay for now about the vaccine mandate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=286.64s)]
*  What can you do to get Secretary of Defense Austin [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=289.68s)]
*  to pay attention? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=293.52s)]
*  Look, one of the things that we do in my office [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=295.28s)]
*  is we take all these individuals that reach out to us. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=297.24s)]
*  We write a letter to the Pentagon or Navy Special Warfare. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  You take your pick-up who we say, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=304.4s)]
*  hey, listen, we want you to sign this letter [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=305.88s)]
*  acknowledging that you take full liability [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=308.08s)]
*  for any and all adverse effects related to this vaccine. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=310.56s)]
*  And of course the answer is they never get back [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  and acknowledge that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=316.14s)]
*  They refuse to acknowledge immunity based upon the fact [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=317.3s)]
*  that people have already been sick. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=320.71999999999997s)]
*  They refuse to talk about anything [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=322.0s)]
*  that doesn't fit their narrative. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=323.94s)]
*  And so what can you do with people like that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=325.5s)]
*  that won't listen? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPjOYWxi54Q&t=327.14s)]
