# Some people of Gaza are ‘fed up’ with Hamas, want a better life: Gen. Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y)
*  We'll take it back here. Rich Edson, thank you very much, Rich. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Eric? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  Or if you know in the past, Israel has hit Hamas military sites with targeted retaliatory [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  attacks. But now, this seems different. Will the Israeli military move in and re-occupy [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=9.44s)]
*  Gaza? Will we see targeted assassinations of Hamas leaders who live freely in luxury [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=14.84s)]
*  in Qatar? Can Hamas truly be destroyed? The chairman of the Institute for the Study of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=20.76s)]
*  War, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, General Jack Keane, joins us now. General, what do [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=26.48s)]
*  you predict the Israeli military will now do? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=31.16s)]
*  Well, I take them at their word that they're dead serious this time about destroying Hamas. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=35.4s)]
*  And if that indeed is the case, they're going to have to go back and occupy Gaza much as [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=43.16s)]
*  they gave it up in 2005. Hamas took over in 2007 and opposed draconian repression on the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=49.24s)]
*  people, totalitarian rule, and they've had four military incursions into Israel as a [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=56.68s)]
*  result of that. In 2008, 2012, 2014, and 2021, a total of 300 Israelis, odd, were killed [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=63.84s)]
*  in those incursions, and now we've at least doubled that in one day by the most recent [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  incursion. By the way, the Palestinians who live in Gaza lost over 6,000 people during [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=77.60000000000001s)]
*  that time frame. I think what has happened here, and it's not well publicized, is at [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=84.64s)]
*  times the political leadership really wanted the IDF to go back in and occupy, and they've [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=91.84s)]
*  always resisted it. If we are serious about eliminating Hamas, then the IDF has to occupy [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=97.16s)]
*  Gaza and systematically go about eliminating them with the cooperation of the people. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=105.16s)]
*  Now, the people here can be exploited in a positive way because they've been repressed. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=112.16s)]
*  They don't have anything to show for the life that they have in there. They know full well [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=117.16s)]
*  after all of these years, 16 years, that Hamas hasn't done much of anything to help them. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=122.16s)]
*  As a matter of fact, when they go and conduct an operation against the Israelis, they use [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=129.16s)]
*  the people to hide from, and they weaponize the casualties that have taken place, use [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=135.16s)]
*  that as evidence to try to attempt to get a ceasefire and cessation of military activities. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=140.16s)]
*  So the people are fed up with this. Not all of them. You can see young people that are [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=146.16s)]
*  easy to radicalize because there's no jobs, there's no upward mobility, but the people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=151.16s)]
*  who are raising families there want a better life. That is something the Israelis can take [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=157.16s)]
*  advantage of. Work with the people that do what? To give up Hamas militants who are in [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=163.16s)]
*  that area. They'll have good intelligence on some of it, but they won't have intelligence [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=170.16s)]
*  on all of it, and they need the people to do that. We learned that the hard way ourselves [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=174.16s)]
*  in Iraq particularly, and we use those skill sets in Afghanistan. So we'll see. I hope [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=181.16s)]
*  the Israelis do what I'm suggesting here, reoccupy and systematically go about it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=189.16s)]
*  If they make a race to the coastline a week or two weeks, destroy missiles and rocket [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=195.16s)]
*  launchers, that's not going to eliminate Hamas. They're going to come back. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=201.16s)]
*  You're talking about what could be bloody street battles, urban warfare, house to house [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=207.16s)]
*  like we saw in Fallujah? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=211.16s)]
*  Not quite like that. I think if they get the cooperation of the people, if there's no cooperation [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=215.16s)]
*  of the people whatsoever, then we're going to have scenes like that. But the Israelis [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=220.16s)]
*  are highly skilled. Many of them speak the language. They have people who have relationships [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=225.16s)]
*  with Palestinians. Their informant network, which for some reason didn't predict this [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=232.16s)]
*  attack, has been hugely excellent in the past. I think those ties will be there. We'll see. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=239.16s)]
*  I think the commitment I'm hearing is that they do want to eliminate Hamas this time, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=247.16s)]
*  and to do that, the nature of their military operations would have to change, and their [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=253.16s)]
*  relationship with the people that live in Gaza will also have to change. And this will [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=258.16s)]
*  take time. There has to be patience here. This is not a couple of weeks. This is months [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=263.16s)]
*  in conducting an operation like this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=269.16s)]
*  And finally, what do you make of those, some on the left and elsewhere and at the UN, who [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=272.16s)]
*  call for a quote, de-escalation and a ceasefire? Your reaction to that? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=277.16s)]
*  Yeah, well, isn't that so predictable? I mean, in the UN there's an anti-Israeli movement [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=282.16s)]
*  that exists in the UN, and yet it's the only democracy in the Middle East. Never has made [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=289.16s)]
*  any sense to me whatsoever. And they have terrorist organizations, and in the past, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=295.16s)]
*  armies attacking them, and yet the Israelis get blamed for everything that's wrong that's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=300.16s)]
*  taken place in the Middle East or particularly in Israel. That's not going to change. It's [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=306.16s)]
*  not going to change. The Israelis got to pursue their national interests here. They [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=311.16s)]
*  have to protect their people. I think they recognize the only long-term way to protect [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=316.16s)]
*  them from this militant organization, Hamas, which is fundamentally a terrorist organization, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=321.16s)]
*  that's single purposes to destroy the state of Israel is they've got to go in there and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=326.16s)]
*  deal with them and take the time and patience to get everyone on them. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=331.16s)]
*  We stand by our democratic ally of Israel against these terrorists, General [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=336.16s)]
*  Jack Keene. As always, thank you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i69_DtYuy5Y&t=340.16s)]
