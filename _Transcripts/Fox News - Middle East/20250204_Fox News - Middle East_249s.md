# Questions swirl around Trump’s Gaza takeover plan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 04, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ)
*  All right, joining me now, Fox News senior White House correspondent Peter Ducey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Peter, we were starting the show with an angle about Doge and what they're up against and [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=3.44s)]
*  what they're doing. We then went to this story. Now it's going to be the Riviera on the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  This is where we are at the end of a day. And one of the very surprising things about [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=15.52s)]
*  this announcement with Doge, so much of the talk of Trump's first two weeks has been shrinking the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=19.68s)]
*  size of the federal government and shrinking federal spending to take over Gaza would probably [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=24.16s)]
*  be really expensive. We did not get to the dollars and cents of it during this press conference [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  tonight. Something else that we don't know who came up with this plan and when did they come up [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=34.64s)]
*  with it? Because earlier in the day, President Trump was still talking about Gaza basically as [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=39.68s)]
*  a wasteland, as a destruction site. His team was out there on the shows and on a background call [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=44.8s)]
*  saying it's going to be 10 to 15 years before anything can be done there. The president never [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=49.76s)]
*  mentioned that the United States was going to take over Gaza. And so this could be and again, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=54.96s)]
*  first draft of history is what we're working on here. This could be something that he and Netanyahu [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=61.36s)]
*  came up with just now. And maybe that is the reason why we were so delayed here, because [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=65.92s)]
*  President Trump wanted to hide a major announcement about U.S. foreign policy in his prepared statement [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=72.72s)]
*  before taking questions. But it's something over the last couple of weeks, we have heard the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=79.2s)]
*  president say that he thinks Gaza is beautiful and they have the best weather today, as you mentioned, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  Riviera in the Middle East. It sounds like he's been talking about it like somewhere that they [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=90.8s)]
*  should build a sandals. And now he's talking about it like somewhere that the United States [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=96.16s)]
*  should go plant a flag. Yeah, this is it's a it's a big leap from hotel development for Western [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=100.88s)]
*  interests that could maybe bring some stability to the area, to a U.S. takeover of Gaza. And [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=109.44s)]
*  things can happen where conversations are had and then people get a little carried away. But [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=117.52s)]
*  maybe this has been batted around for a lot longer than we know, Peter. But it gets does it not get [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=122.72s)]
*  Netanyahu potentially out of some political trouble at home as well, Peter? I know you've [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=128.64s)]
*  reported on that. It depends on how badly the Israeli people, some of whom are really steamed [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=134.16s)]
*  at Netanyahu for the way that things have been going over the last couple of months, want to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=139.67999999999998s)]
*  have a United States territory, occupied territory right next door. Common Sense would probably say [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=143.76s)]
*  they would rather have American troops there than Hamas guys who are launching stuff over the fence [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  every day. But when you look at the history of Donald Trump since long before he got officially [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=154.0s)]
*  into politics, he was one of the most vocal critics kind of in the middle against the way [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=158.96s)]
*  that Bush was handling the Iraq war. He didn't think that we should be in these quagmires. And [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=163.84s)]
*  until a half an hour ago, he was describing Gaza as a place that is just that has always had these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=169.84s)]
*  problems. It is very surprising to hear that he thinks a United States takeover would help. But [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=176.32s)]
*  again, we don't know if I would have been recognized. I would have asked, how bad do you want [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=186.56s)]
*  it? When? Let's get Secretary Heg set up here. How many troops is it going to take to go and do [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=191.2s)]
*  something that the Israelis have been trying to do for over a year? Yeah, we're out of money. And I [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=197.28s)]
*  guess the thought would be would make money there. But the criticism, Peter, which I know we're going [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=202.96s)]
*  to hear is, does this mean you're a flip flopper on nation building? That's the criticism. And I'm [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=210.56s)]
*  sure they're going to get ready for that and have an answer for it. But that's going to require some [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=217.36s)]
*  hair splitting. But maybe expansion is the theme of Trump 47, Panama Canal, Canada, Greenland, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=223.52s)]
*  Gaza. Don't know what it's going to be next week. All right, Peter, great to see you. Another busy day. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=32bZCg5OZgQ&t=232.48s)]
