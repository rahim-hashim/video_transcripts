# Whoopi Goldberg's 'idiotic' take on Iran #iran #foxnews #shorts #politics #news #usa #theview
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY)
*  The Iranians literally throw gay people off of buildings. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=0.0s)]
*  They don't adhere to basic human rights. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=2.5s)]
*  Listen, here's the thing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=4.0s)]
*  Let's not do that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=5.0s)]
*  Because if we start with that, we have been known in this country to tie gay folks to the cart. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=8.0s)]
*  Where the gay-grinds-cult-dream is two days, 20, 25, 30, 40, nothing compared to the United States. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=15.0s)]
*  They used to just keep hanging black people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=19.0s)]
*  It is not even the same. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=21.0s)]
*  I think it's very different to live in the United States in 2025 than it is to live in Iran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=23.0s)]
*  Not if you're black. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=27.0s)]
*  Not for everybody. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, I call that show a daily nationally televised insane asylum for a reason. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=29.0s)]
*  It's hard to overstate the moral idiocy of what we just heard there from Whoopi Goldberg in particular. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=34.0s)]
*  So, Alyssa Farr is making the point correctly about how people are subjugated brutally by the Iranian regime. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=40.0s)]
*  And Whoopi's like, oh, well, look at what we do here in the U.S. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=48.0s)]
*  There are hate crimes here. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=51.0s)]
*  Our government prosecutes hate crimes. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=52.0s)]
*  They don't commit them as a matter of course. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=56.0s)]
*  For her to say, oh, well, if you're black in the United States in 2025, it's basically the same as being a dissident or anyone in Iran, that is deeply, deeply ignorant. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=59.0s)]
*  Whoopi Goldberg, as a black woman, is one of the most fabulously wealthy people in the world. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=71.0s)]
*  She gets up every morning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=77.0s)]
*  She rolls in to do an hour of poorly informed television. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=79.0s)]
*  She collects a handsome paycheck and she goes and lives her life however the heck she wants. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=82.0s)]
*  Sounds pretty great. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rlk0gf1B-ZY&t=87.0s)]
