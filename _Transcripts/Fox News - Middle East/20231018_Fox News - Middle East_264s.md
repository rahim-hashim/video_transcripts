# Crisis facing Israel is not ‘business as usual’: Reporter
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8)
*  Reporter for the Free Press, Tim Samuels has spent time on the ground this week inside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel covering the atrocities of the ongoing war with Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=5.58s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=8.98s)]
*  I want to ask you first for your reaction to the president's remarks a moment ago. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=12.06s)]
*  The sense I got when I was in Israel is that people are terrified. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=18.04s)]
*  The normal security apparatus which people have so much faith in seems to have failed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=21.76s)]
*  them. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=26.2s)]
*  There was a horrific fear that things could kick off from the north leaving Israel really [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=27.2s)]
*  vulnerable and President Biden seems to be saying the things that Netanyahu isn't. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=31.08s)]
*  He is that kind of avuncular figure putting an arm around Israel at the moment saying [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=37.72s)]
*  things are going to be okay. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=43.2s)]
*  We've got your back. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  And from Israelis across the political spectrum who I met over the last week, there's a real [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  sense of relief that President Biden seems to be taking this so personally and so seriously [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=50.92s)]
*  demonstrated by his visit there today. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=58.440000000000005s)]
*  So I think I think relief at this unprecedented moment of Israel feeling more vulnerable than [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=61.24s)]
*  at any point in its existence really. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  The the Pentagon, the State Department, the White House over the last few days has been [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=71.72s)]
*  continuously about preventing this war between Israel and Gaza from becoming a bigger regional [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=76.38s)]
*  conflict. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=84.46s)]
*  But the reality is that we've already seen Hezbollah launch rockets across the border, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=85.46s)]
*  protests across the Middle East, anti-American, anti-Israel protests erupted like wildfire [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=92.02s)]
*  across the Middle East last night. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=98.7s)]
*  Has that ship already sailed? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=101.42s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=105.34s)]
*  I think it sails when you see Hezbollah really stepping up. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=106.34s)]
*  I mean, at the moment, there are some salvos going back and forth. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=110.78s)]
*  It's sort of a little bit business as usual, a little bit more than that on the north. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=114.62s)]
*  But if Hezbollah, with 10 times the arsenal of Hamas, with that full backing of Iran, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=118.82s)]
*  do choose to engage, that will radically, radically shift the situation. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=126.5s)]
*  It's coming from Hamas in the south, again, its business as usual to some extent for Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=131.7s)]
*  But to have Hezbollah unleash its kind of gargantuan arsenal from the north would be [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=138.01999999999998s)]
*  conceivably a game changer. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=144.29999999999998s)]
*  And that's probably why America, Britain and other nations are deploying troops to the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=146.14s)]
*  area. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=152.14s)]
*  This is different. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=153.14s)]
*  This really isn't business as usual. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=154.14s)]
*  Tim, I want to ask you this question because a lot of people have different interpretations [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  Why do you think President Biden is there on the ground right now? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=162.02s)]
*  What do you think is behind that decision, despite the security risks? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  I think he has a genuine history and affection for Israel that goes back throughout his time [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=171.7s)]
*  as a senator. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=181.38s)]
*  And I think he, you know, when you see photographs of what happened on the ground, and I was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=182.57999999999998s)]
*  in Kibbutz Be'erie last week, seen of a slaughter, of a massacre. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=188.5s)]
*  I was outside a house where eight babies were burnt to death. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=193.22s)]
*  When you see these things, and I'm sure President Biden's seen a lot of the material that isn't [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  in the public, you can't help but be emotionally drawn into this. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=203.1s)]
*  And I think President Biden is reacting to what he's seen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=209.22s)]
*  I think he's come over to say at this time of, you know, modern-day pogroms are essentially [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=212.66s)]
*  taking place that America has got your back. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=217.78s)]
*  And I think by also coming over and holding Israel in this kind of tight embrace, he's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=222.34s)]
*  probably thinking it's a chance to moderate some of the Israeli reaction to ensure that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=227.18s)]
*  it operates as far as possible to minimize where possible Palestinian civilian casualties. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=235.22s)]
*  So I think there's an emotional gut reaction from President Biden. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=241.14s)]
*  And I think there's probably tactical concerns going on at the same time. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=245.06s)]
*  All right, Tim Samuels, we've got to leave it there. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=249.46s)]
*  Thanks for taking time with us. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrPzzn83ZE8&t=251.9s)]
