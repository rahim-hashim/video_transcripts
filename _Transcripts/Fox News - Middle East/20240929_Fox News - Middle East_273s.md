# Israeli Ambassador to UN sends strong warning to whoever attacks nation
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8)
*  For more, let's bring in Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danin. Mr. Ambassador, welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me again, Mike. So let's talk about the operation in Yemen today, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=6.0s)]
*  taking out Houthi targets. Why did you feel a need to do that today? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=10.96s)]
*  Well, it was another unprovoked attack against Israel. You know, Mike, you showed them up earlier, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  you see the distance between Israel and Yemen, and you ask yourself why we have a conflict with [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Yemen. The only reason, because there are proxies over Iran, and they send ballistic missiles into [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=27.12s)]
*  Israel, and we cannot see it eye to eye. Enough is enough. Whoever will attack Israel, we will [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=33.36s)]
*  retaliate, whether it's in Beirut, in Yemen, and we're sending a message to others. They should be [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=39.68s)]
*  very careful about attacking Israel. We will not wait. We will attack them back immediately. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=44.56s)]
*  There is some reported tension between the Pentagon Secretary Austin and Yoav Galant, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  the defense minister of your country, over perhaps the lack of notice before taking out Hezbollah's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=56.16s)]
*  leader, Nasrallah. Is that fair, and should there have been better communication between the U.S. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=62.8s)]
*  and Israel before that happened? So there is a strong bond between Israel and the U.S., [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=68.64s)]
*  and we appreciate the support of the U.S., and I can tell you we consult with our allies in Washington, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=74.72s)]
*  but not always you ask for permission. I don't think it will serve the interest of the U.S. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=80.8s)]
*  if Israel would ask for permission. We tell the Americans and other colleagues we are hunting down [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=86.16s)]
*  those terrorists, and when you look at Nasrallah and Ibrahim Aki, that we killed a few days ago, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=91.28s)]
*  they're the enemies of the U.S. They have the blood on their hands of American soldiers, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=96.96s)]
*  Marine soldiers, that attacked U.S. embassies, so I think the U.S. should be thankful for what we did [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=102.16s)]
*  killing those bad guys. So I don't think it's useful to come and ask for permission. We are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=108.32s)]
*  sovereign nation, but we are consulting, we are coordinating the goals of our operations, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=113.36s)]
*  but I don't think it's smart to ask for permission before every attack. While you're taking out terror [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=119.2s)]
*  leaders in Lebanon, you are also taking out those targets in Yemen. You're also dismantling [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=124.4s)]
*  underground tunnels in Gaza. What's the latest on that effort? So you know everything is linked to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=129.92s)]
*  Iran. You know, Mike, you mentioned all the proxies. They all get funding from Iran. They get directions [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=135.84s)]
*  from Iran, and we are fighting those bad guys. And also in Gaza, you know, we moved ahead. We [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=141.04s)]
*  still have 101 hostages kept in those tunnels that you are showing now, suffocating. We don't know [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=147.04s)]
*  their conditions, no visitation of the Red Cross or any UN officials, so we are committed to bring [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=153.2s)]
*  them back home. Either we do it through negotiations or through our military operations. We are moving [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=159.2s)]
*  forward in Gaza, and I think we are sending a clear message that we have waited for a year [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=165.84s)]
*  since October 7th. We're going to mention next week a year for the massacre. We expect that [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=170.96s)]
*  our enemies will realize that they cannot destroy us. We are a strong nation, determination. We are [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=177.44s)]
*  a peaceful nation, and hopefully once they will realize that they cannot destroy us, we can speak [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=182.72s)]
*  about some kind of a ceasefire or some even peace treaty with other countries. The Biden [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=187.76s)]
*  administration is still pushing for diplomatic talks. Let's play this from John Kirby at the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=194.16s)]
*  White House. We are continuing to talk to the Israelis about what the right next steps are, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  and as you rightly said in the opening here, the president continues to believe that there needs [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=205.28s)]
*  to be time and space for diplomacy, and that means we'd like to see a ceasefire in place so that that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=210.0s)]
*  diplomacy can breathe. Mr. Ambassador, is there any chance of a ceasefire anytime soon? Yes, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=214.32s)]
*  absolutely, Mike. We are open for diplomacy. We have very concrete goals. We want to allow [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=222.4s)]
*  the Israelis who left their homes in northern Israel, 70,000 Israelis who are refugees today, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=227.52s)]
*  they live in shelter places for almost a year. We want to allow them to come back to their homes, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=233.12s)]
*  and we want to push Hezbollah from the fence. If we can achieve it through diplomacy, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=239.76s)]
*  I think it will be great. If not, we will use our might, but I think now is the time [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=244.56s)]
*  for the Lebanese government and the Lebanese people to find the courage to push back against [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=249.04s)]
*  Hezbollah and to make sure that they take control over their country, their future, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=254.72s)]
*  and not allow Hezbollah to drag them to another war with Israel. We can avoid that, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=259.92s)]
*  but it will require Lebanon to be much more involved. Ambassador Danny Dannen, grateful [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=264.4s)]
*  for your time today, sir. Thank you very much. Thank you very much, Mike. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MApYakJbDV8&t=269.84s)]
