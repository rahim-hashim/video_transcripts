# Speaker Johnson proposes diverting IRS funding for Israel aid
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8)
*  An hour from now, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=0.0s)]
*  will testify before Congress over Biden's $106 billion request for aid to Ukraine and [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=7.08s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=13.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, in an exclusive interview, new Speaker of the House Mike Johnson tells Kayleigh [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=14.48s)]
*  McEnany how he plans to pay for the aid to Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=18.48s)]
*  My intention and my desire in the first draft of this bill is to take some of the money [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=24.48s)]
*  that has been set aside for building and bulking up the IRS right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=28.68s)]
*  They have about $67 billion in that fund and we'll try to take the $14.5 billion necessary [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=32.6s)]
*  for this immediate and urgent need. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=37.76s)]
*  Kayleigh McEnany, co-host of Outnumber, joins us now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=40.4s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=43.16s)]
*  Congratulations on that interview. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=44.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=45.16s)]
*  What was it like? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=46.16s)]
*  The words kind, joyful, humble don't often characterize politicians that I've encountered. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=47.16s)]
*  They do for Mike Johnson. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=52.92s)]
*  There's chaos on the Hill. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=54.6s)]
*  A lot needs to be done, but he had such calm in his demeanor. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  I really believe he thinks God is leading the way. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=59.64s)]
*  This will all get figured out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=62.42s)]
*  And he is, you know, I believe here for an esther-like moment for such a time as this. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=63.88s)]
*  For such a time as this. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=67.76s)]
*  Our country needs that, right? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=68.76s)]
*  He was just talking about aid for Israel. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=70.44s)]
*  His package is different than what they're proposing, what Joe Biden is proposing. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=72.2s)]
*  How does he plan to face this opposition? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=76.28s)]
*  How does he want to make his plan work? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=78.68s)]
*  He's facing some opposition. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=80.72s)]
*  You know, he said Republicans are 100% united. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=81.72s)]
*  And I said, well, what about Massey, who said he's opposed to it? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=84.32s)]
*  He said, I immediately picked up my phone before I interviewed with you, texted him [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  and said, we need to talk. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  And I said, well, what about Democrats in Congress who don't want to cut IRS funding? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  He said, Chuck Schumer and I are going to have a direct and thoughtful conversation. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=94.24s)]
*  And this is how the Hill should work, right? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=98.28s)]
*  We have disagreements. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  We have thoughtful conversations. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=100.96s)]
*  We debate and come up with answers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=102.25999999999999s)]
*  And I think he is someone who is willing to reach across the aisle and say, let's do this [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  together. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=107.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=108.16s)]
*  Israel means a great deal to him as a Christian. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=109.16s)]
*  He's pro-Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=110.67999999999999s)]
*  He talks about unifying together on this issue, right? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=111.80000000000001s)]
*  Didn't you ask him about that? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=115.2s)]
*  Yes, unifying together on this issue. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=116.2s)]
*  And he said, you know, I essentially have a calculus to the American people. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=117.92s)]
*  Do you want more IRS agents or do you want aid to our closest ally? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=121.76s)]
*  And you know, others say you're being political on this. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  He's not being political. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=128.44s)]
*  He says our debt is a national security threat. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=129.44s)]
*  We have to start paying for things because American strength is encumbered when we don't. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=131.52s)]
*  I think we have a clip of it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=138.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you have any sense on how united the Republican conference is on this front? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=140.44s)]
*  Well, the Republican conference is 100 percent united and I hope the Democrats will be as [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=144.72s)]
*  well. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=148.76s)]
*  I believe Massey said he wouldn't, he wouldn't vote for it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=149.76s)]
*  I just texted him before we sat down and said we got to have a talk. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=152.04s)]
*  Thomas Massey is one of my favorite people in the world. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  He's principled. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=156.76s)]
*  He's a constitutionalist, you know. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  But we have to, we have to figure this out. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=160.44s)]
*  I mean, he just seems like such a remarkable person. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=162.92s)]
*  And listen to that speech on the House floor when he was, when he became the speaker. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=165.88s)]
*  He talked about his dad. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=170.2s)]
*  He talked about his Christian faith. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=171.2s)]
*  He talked about being a constitutionalist. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=173.6s)]
*  Yes, and the first words out of his mouth were Hakeem Jeffries, the Democrat minority [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=175.4s)]
*  leader. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=180.28s)]
*  I believe he has a good heart and I want to find common ground. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=181.28s)]
*  I think that speaks to his faith. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=183.48s)]
*  He wants to work together. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and didn't you say he's going to the prayer room every day? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes, he took me to the prayer room. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=188.4s)]
*  It was made in 1954, I believe, and he said he's going to start every morning in prayer [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  in that room before the picture of George Washington on his knees and ask for wisdom [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=195.28s)]
*  and guidance. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  That's great. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  So everyone out there, pray for him as our speaker because our country really needs some [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  guidance from God right now. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Kaylee, we can watch the exclusive interview today at noon. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=205.52s)]
*  All about his faith. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  I asked him about Bill Maher who had some harsh words for him and he will respond and share [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  his heart with us. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=213.8s)]
*  Maybe he'll go on with Bill Maher. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=214.8s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=215.8s)]
*  Oh, I don't wish that upon him. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=216.8s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHZbt9Cl3n8&t=218.56s)]
