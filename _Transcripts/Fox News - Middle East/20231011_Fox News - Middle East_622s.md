**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE)

*  decapitated and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=25.82s)]
*  The Hamas went into their into their neighborhood and took control of it the entire kibbutz [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=27.36s)]
*  Which was 1200 residents and some of them were beheaded [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=33.6s)]
*  Right in front of their parents and then their parents were killed after the parents had to watch their babies [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=36.96s)]
*  Beheaded so that's what and then she has a Palestinian flag outside of her office [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=42.8s)]
*  So Hillary's asking her about do you condone what's happening? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  watch [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=51.480000000000004s)]

*  You can't comment about Hamas terrorists chopping off babies head [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=65.48s)]
*  Do you condone? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=69.76s)]
*  What Hamas has done chopping off babies heads burning children alive breaking women in the street? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=71.76s)]
*  You have no comment about children's heads being chopped off [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=82.36s)]
*  I [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=87.36s)]
*  Congressman why do you have the Palestinian flag outside your office if you do not condone what Hamas terrorists in the mountain Israel? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=91.04s)]
*  Do is really like it's not matter to you [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=100.48s)]
*  That should be the easiest question in the world to answer are you okay with [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=104.6s)]
*  Hamas cutting off babies head the answer is that's savage. It's terrible. It's wrong. Did she say it? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=112.2s)]
*  No, she ran she retreated to an elevator and she had her staff Lawrence [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=119.24s)]
*  Essentially run interference so Hillary's camera person couldn't get a shot of Tlaib not saying the right thing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Tlaib said nothing which is the wrong thing [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=132.68s)]
*  Yeah, and she's never met a camera that she didn't like before [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  She always has something to say her and the rest of the squad members, but suddenly [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=139.12s)]
*  They have nothing to say about this and to your point Brian [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=143.92s)]
*  You did have AOC that condemned some of the stuff as well [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=147.32s)]
*  You did have her talk about the protesters that were racist protesting in New York [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=150.52s)]
*  But I was on Capitol Hill as well yesterday [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=155.56s)]
*  I went out there to talk with some of the representatives to say okay if Tlaib is not gonna condemn this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=157.88s)]
*  Will you at least condemn some of her comments? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=163.48s)]
*  Will you at least talk about the Palestinian flag been out there? We will you at least? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  Suggest that the Biden administration frees the six billion dollars to Iran. This is what they have to say [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=171.96s)]
*  Mr. Leader should receive the Tlaib still have the Palestinian flag. This is America. You're not the word. It's a flag that you prefer [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  I think she has every right to have a Palestinian flag. I'm not gonna comment on [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=186.36s)]
*  She's a great she's Palestinian [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=190.92s)]
*  You know that doesn't mean she's a terrorist. It doesn't mean that she condones this was a gross attack on human life. It was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=194.84s)]
*  Reprehensible and we want justice and we want peace by the ministers that six of that six billion dollars can be frozen [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=202.24s)]
*  Do you think it should be frozen? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=208.4s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi should we freeze that six billion dollars the Biden administration said we have the ability to do that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=210.4s)]
*  But I haven't heard that you just tell me that mr. Clyburn [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=216.32s)]
*  Should there six billion dollars be frozen? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=220.52s)]
*  The Biden administration said they have the ability to do it [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=223.16s)]
*  No penny is gone of that six billion dollars Iran should have no support and we need to make sure that Iran [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=225.56s)]
*  Cannot continue to fund these groups like the mosque Palestinian Islamic jihad and this ball up [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=232.88s)]
*  Lawrence I [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=240.76s)]
*  Mean just just to put a boat bow on this guys. The reason why this is important is not just to condemn [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=241.96s)]
*  The comments as well as the flag being stationed outside of her office [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  But to get to the core of it and we talked a lot a little bit about the president speech yesterday [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  And there was a lot of heart there [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=257.76s)]
*  But but the one thing that I and when I talked to my friends that serve in the service as well as generals [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=259.40000000000003s)]
*  Is what the president did not identify the enemy? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=264.88s)]
*  He did not address Iran and you can have heart all day and say that you you feel for the Israeli people [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=267.68s)]
*  But to not address the people that help them coordinate this attack is [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=274.84s)]
*  Malpractice to allow the six billion dollars to be out there is still malpractice and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=279.8s)]
*  Admiral Kirby knows this the general Lloyd Austin knows this but they have been silent from that perspective Brian [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=285.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean right now we're watching looking some live pictures on the unfolding war [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=294.2s)]
*  That we're seeing now and and that is the area that is considered the Gaza Strip's territory port of Gaza [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=299.86s)]
*  Yeah, the port of Gaza. So that's their area and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=307.14s)]
*  That is where with their semblance of Navy and terror activities would take place [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=310.82s)]
*  So they are targeting it and what we saw prior to are you going to the the package was? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=315.21999999999997s)]
*  Series of firing. I mean it was almost totally obscured by the smoke. They know exactly where they're going. They're not arbitrarily [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=322.26s)]
*  Just bombing out sites in Gaza. They're going for the headquarters. They're going for the warlords [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=328.98s)]
*  So Gaza's 25 miles long the powers turned off now Israel stopped the entry of food and fuel and medicine into Gaza [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  And keep in mind they warned they warned all the civilians there to get out that they were going to be doing this [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=341.62s)]
*  The military I assume stayed the the Hamas terrorists stayed residents received a text message [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=348.02000000000004s)]
*  Yesterday telling them to go to Egypt immediately and said you stay and you die [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=354.66s)]
*  Israeli warplanes hammered the Gaza Strip neighborhood by neighborhood yesterday and we have images of that [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=360.14000000000004s)]
*  Israel stepped up its offensive yesterday expanding the mobilization of their reservists to what was the original number? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=366.3s)]
*  They were calling in a hundred and fifty thousand reservists now. It's [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=372.5s)]
*  360,000 overall a fighting force of six hundred thousand [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=375.66s)]
*  Yeah, and y'all might know people that left America [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=379.06s)]
*  We all know people who left America to go over there because they were called and you were telling me if you're in another country [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=381.82s)]
*  it's voluntary because the way the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=388.14s)]
*  the way military conscription works in [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=391.26s)]
*  Israel is after you graduate you serve two years in the IDF and then when you're done with that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=393.97999999999996s)]
*  You can be called up at any time until you are at the age of 45 [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=399.58s)]
*  And so that impacts tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of people around the world if you're here in the United States [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=403.7s)]
*  I understand it is voluntary whether you come back it is not necessarily [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=409.98s)]
*  Mandatory one of my friends just sent me something and I'm gonna preface this with it's from Twitter [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=416.26s)]
*  I do not know if it is true, but it is quite a story. It says [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=422.94s)]
*  This fellow just read an account by an L. Al crew member. Keep in mind [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=426.94s)]
*  we were talking about this earlier LL is the official airline of Israel and they sent a jumbo jet full of [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=431.34s)]
*  IDF members back to Israel yesterday anyway this story an [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=439.78s)]
*  Orthodox Jewish man who preferred to remain anonymous stood quietly near the LL counter at JFK yesterday [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=444.9s)]
*  Anybody who showed up and showed him an IDF call-up notice got his ticket paid for I think it's true [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=452.82s)]
*  I read this article last night. He paid for 250 tickets [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=460.08s)]
*  So nice of him so nice and unbelievable [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=463.78000000000003s)]
*  But it just goes to show you how and we were talking with one of the rabbis who is over in Israel [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=465.5s)]
*  It's wherever you are around the world when your homeland needs you you go you drop everything if you can [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=471.74s)]
*  And you just go [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=479.18s)]
*  You know as we look at these life pictures and you see the shelling [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=483.22s)]
*  I think it's important to know that as these soldiers are making their way to join the war here [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=487.34000000000003s)]
*  I [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=493.98s)]
*  And I know people are looking at this and I know Israel is going to continue to be blamed in some sort by a lot [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=495.18s)]
*  Of folks in the mainstream media, but I think it's important to know what Hamas is doing [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=501.58000000000004s)]
*  They use human shields everywhere these buildings have been given warning [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=506.86s)]
*  And some of the folks decide to stay they stay because they want the humans there [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=512.34s)]
*  They want some type of propaganda to go out that it is Israel that is the enemy it is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=518.1s)]
*  Israel that is targeting innocent people [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=524.74s)]
*  They've been doing this for a long time [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=527.58s)]
*  So I think that is something for us to consider as we see these these buildings collapse indeed [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=529.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I mean Lawrence you were talking about how [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=535.38s)]
*  So many people blame blame Israel [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=539.02s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw Black Lives Matter, Chicago? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=542.5s)]
*  Under fire for they for the pro-palestinian post with a [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=546.5s)]
*  paraglider terrorist so they're celebrating the attacks or in Sydney, Australia at the Opera House when they're yelling out gas the Jews or [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=550.78s)]
*  Free Palestine group in New York City burning the Israeli flag stomping on it and holding up swastikas totally anti-semitic [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=557.86s)]
*  I'm not surprised at all Ainsley a lot of these folks that identified with the Democratic Party that calls themselves [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=566.0999999999999s)]
*  Progressives they look at the Jewish people must differently and it's sad and I think part of it is hate [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EchA8k111kE&t=574.82s)]
