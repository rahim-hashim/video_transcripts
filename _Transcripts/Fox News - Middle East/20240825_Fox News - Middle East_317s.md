# Former Green Beret warns of October 7, Russian theatre-type attack on US
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. Emergency situation declared in Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=0.0s)]
*  overnight. The IDF strikes Hezbollah targets in Lebanon after detecting that [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=4.38s)]
*  the terror group was planning to launch an imminent attack on Israel. Former [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Green Beret, Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann, and our friend joins us now in [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=14.48s)]
*  studio. Colonel, thanks for being here. Thanks for having me. I just first your reaction to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=17.88s)]
*  Israel's preemptive strike against Hezbollah. You know, the first thing I [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  thought about when I saw that is that we had better start paying attention here [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=24.6s)]
*  at home. You know, what happened on October 7 is not an anomaly. It's gonna [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=27.92s)]
*  hit us here at home. In fact, a lot of the veterans groups who are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=31.64s)]
*  warning about an attack are saying that the next attack that hits the homeland [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=35.08s)]
*  is not going to be a World Trade Center type attack. It's going to be more of an [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=38.44s)]
*  October 7 style, Russian theater style attack where we live, work and play. So I [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=41.2s)]
*  hope we're paying close attention to this. Wow, I mean you're talking, we've let in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=45.44s)]
*  millions and millions of people, we have no idea who we are, we're vulnerable. Yeah, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  we are and ironically the attackers that we're probably going to see do that have [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=51.92s)]
*  trained on in the very NATO bases that we lived and operated in for 20 years in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=56.84s)]
*  Afghanistan. Wow, wow. Well, let's turn to that topic of Afghanistan because [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=60.96s)]
*  tomorrow is the three-year anniversary of that terrible day at Abbey Gate. You [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  were in the middle of almost every aspect of that. You knew a lot of people [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=68.2s)]
*  on the ground. Just reflect three years later. Yeah, you know, my heart goes out [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=71.52000000000001s)]
*  to all the families of the 13th Fall and you know we did a play called Last Out [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=76.92s)]
*  where we toured the country right after it happened and I met with so many of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=80.76s)]
*  the family members and I know they're hurting right now and I know so many of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=83.72s)]
*  their teammates are hurting right now so that's my first thing. The other thing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=86.64s)]
*  that I would say though is that we've really got to pay attention to what [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=90.06s)]
*  happened there because the same way that suicide bomber followed our troops into [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=92.94s)]
*  Abbey Gate as they tried to leave, Afghanistan has followed us home. We may [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=97.0s)]
*  be done with Afghanistan but it's not done with us and what the veterans are [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=101.4s)]
*  trying to tell Americans and our politicians right now who don't seem to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=105.04s)]
*  want to listen is that the enemy has a vote and they are still operating out of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=107.8s)]
*  Afghanistan and they very much intend to hit us. Blame that a little bit more. What [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=112.72s)]
*  do you mean by that? Afghanistan following us home? Well, you know, remember that the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=115.64s)]
*  guys and girls that picked up the phone when we abandoned Afghanistan three [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=119.4s)]
*  years ago and the government didn't were veterans who had worked with [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=122.52s)]
*  intelligence professionals and special operators out of Afghanistan. Well, we never [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=125.52s)]
*  hung up the phone. We paid for safe houses, medical supplies, food drops and [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=128.4s)]
*  these individuals that we trained to collect information have continued to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=131.84s)]
*  give us information about what's coming and what they're telling us is there's [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=136.12s)]
*  20-plus terror groups in Afghanistan. The son of Osama bin Laden, Hamza bin Laden, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=139.24s)]
*  is alive and well and planning operations. He's married to Mullah Omar's [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=144.12s)]
*  daughter, Zawahiri's daughter. That's an unholy marriage right there. And [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=148.12s)]
*  Haqqani's daughter and it's coming our way. In fact, we think they're late-stage [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=151.4s)]
*  preparation right now and we're hearing it from some very vetted sources who [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=155.76s)]
*  frankly don't trust our government to give them that information because of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  the way they left them. So it's not just the equipment we left behind and the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=161.96s)]
*  money they still have, it's a regathering effect in Afghanistan. In my assessment, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=165.44s)]
*  and I know I'm not alone in this, in the veteran community, the dashboard is [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=170.12s)]
*  more than blinking red. It is smoke coming off of it right now in a much [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  more accelerated way. Pre-911 levels you're saying? Bigger than pre-911. There are more fighters in Al- [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=179.68s)]
*  Qaeda 10X than there were pre-911. The way the border has been open, Siraj [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=184.08s)]
*  Haqqani, the father of suicide bombing, is the Minister of Interior. He's issuing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=189.52s)]
*  passports right now. He's the guy that issues travel documents so they're here [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=194.52s)]
*  illicit as well as illicit. And the fact that our government has given $80 million [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=198.24s)]
*  of taxpayer money every 10 days to the Taliban? I mean it's almost, you [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=202.68s)]
*  have to ask yourself, what planet am I on right now at this three-year [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=208.4s)]
*  anniversary? That is all staggering stuff, much of which I didn't know. But we're [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=210.8s)]
*  in the middle of a political campaign right now. We are. Kamala Harris is the [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=218.52s)]
*  nominee. She might get asked about this more, maybe not, but when she was asked [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=221.28s)]
*  about it in April 2021, here's what she said about Afghanistan. Watch. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=225.12s)]
*  Biden always said that he wants you to be the last person in the room, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=229.52s)]
*  particularly for big decisions, just as he was for President Obama. He just made [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=233.4s)]
*  a really big decision. Afghanistan. Yes. Were you the last person in the room? Yes. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=237.52s)]
*  And you feel comfortable? I do. She feels comfortable. What would you say to her? I [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=242.84s)]
*  would say that when we were running Operation Pineapple Express, one of her [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=248.8s)]
*  military advisors contacted Pineapple Express, contacted me, and asked us to get [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=251.8s)]
*  one of their favorite Afghans out of Afghanistan. This was the special advisor [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=256.92s)]
*  to the Vice President of the United States, asked a volunteer group of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=260.64s)]
*  veterans to get an Afghan out. Now you tell me how you can feel comfortable with [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=263.56s)]
*  that. And this is the impact this has had on veterans all over the country. You [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=267.44s)]
*  know, these veterans defended America for 20 years. They did what they were asked [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  to do. And then they were put in a position where they had to answer the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=274.64s)]
*  phone and stand up for allies that our government wouldn't stand up with for. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=278.06s)]
*  And the moral injury that that has caused, the level of suicide and impact, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=281.32s)]
*  this is not a Republican or Democrat issue. This is an American issue. And [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  global War on Terror veterans, Pete, are trying to warn the American people and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=288.88s)]
*  our politicians that it is coming and it's going to come out of the very place [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=293.64s)]
*  that it started. And I hope we're listening. You've said it right here. The [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=297.52s)]
*  dashboard isn't just blinking, it's smoking. Absolutely. I pray you're wrong, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=300.48s)]
*  but I fear you're right because nobody would know it better than you. Thanks, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  Pete. Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann. Nobody's done more to make sure the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=308.32s)]
*  legacy of that war is followed through on both for Afghans but also for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=311.28s)]
*  Americans. Thank you, sir. I appreciate it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYcWJWxhcAk&t=314.8s)]
