# When this is over, Gaza will be very different says Netanyahu adviser Mark Regev
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8)
*  Let's go live now to Tel Aviv and Mark Regev, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=0.0s)]
*  who's senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=2.92s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=5.76s)]
*  Mark, thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  We've been listening to our reporters [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=8.98s)]
*  for the last couple of hours report [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=10.6s)]
*  that what they're hearing and seeing now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=14.9s)]
*  is unlike anything they have seen in the past 21 days. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=16.64s)]
*  Can you shed light on what has changed [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=20.46s)]
*  and what the IDF is now doing? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=23.42s)]
*  Martha, we are beefing up the pressure on Hamas. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=26.72s)]
*  We're increasing the pressure that they're under. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=31.4s)]
*  Our military operations are underway. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  I can't be more specific, of course, at this stage. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=38.72s)]
*  But Hamas is feeling now Israel's might. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=42.4s)]
*  They will continue to be on the receiving end [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=46.64s)]
*  of our military blows until we have dismantled [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=49.44s)]
*  their military machine and dissolve [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=53.04s)]
*  their political structure in Gaza. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=56.24s)]
*  When this is over, Gaza will be very different. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=57.92s)]
*  There will no longer be a brutal, extreme terrorist [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=61.2s)]
*  organization governing the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=64.36s)]
*  That'll be good for the people of Israel, who'll be safer [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=66.6s)]
*  and live more secure lives, free from the threat of constant [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=69.28s)]
*  terrorist attack. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=73.16s)]
*  And it'll be better for the people of Gaza, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=74.24s)]
*  who'll be finally rid of this terrible, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=76.16s)]
*  theocratic, authoritarian regime headed by a terrorist group. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=78.7s)]
*  Mark, I have to say, today I was shown the video of the Hamas [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=83.34s)]
*  body cam of October 7th. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=88.94s)]
*  And it's intertwined with civilian body cams [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=92.25999999999999s)]
*  and recovery people who came in and the videos that they have. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=96.62s)]
*  And it is unlike anything I have ever, ever seen in my life. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=100.94s)]
*  It is bloody and gruesome. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=106.62s)]
*  And beyond that, the thing that is so shocking about it [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=108.74000000000001s)]
*  is the laughter and the smiles of these Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  They are calling home, asking their parents [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=119.42s)]
*  if they're proud of them, telling them [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=121.78s)]
*  they have killed 10 Jews, one phone call that we listen to. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=123.42s)]
*  It's important, I think, for people [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=128.1s)]
*  to understand Israel's reaction and to remember exactly what [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=129.54000000000002s)]
*  happened to these people, Mark. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=135.02s)]
*  You know, Martha, what's interesting [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=138.5s)]
*  is throughout history, we've known terrible regimes. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  We've seen governments commit mass atrocities. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=143.58s)]
*  But what is new about Hamas is they don't hide their crimes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=146.9s)]
*  They take pride in their crimes and they parade their crimes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=151.82000000000002s)]
*  I mean, all that video you saw was taken by Hamas terrorists [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=156.58s)]
*  as they were brutally massacring Israelis. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=160.82000000000002s)]
*  The Nazis tried to hide their crimes. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=164.1s)]
*  The Soviets under Stalin tried to hide their crimes. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=166.94s)]
*  Hamas parades, advertises their crimes against humanity. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=170.46s)]
*  And the documented evidence against them [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=175.58s)]
*  is their own films, the ones you've described, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=177.98s)]
*  the rapes, the murders, the beheadings, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=180.9s)]
*  the massacres of the young people in the pit, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=183.02s)]
*  the burning bodies alive. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=185.5s)]
*  We've all seen this from their own material. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=187.46s)]
*  Their own material condemns them. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=190.58s)]
*  That's who we're dealing, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=194.18s)]
*  a brutal, ruthless terrorist organization. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  Well, you know, I hope that most people [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=197.82000000000002s)]
*  don't ever have to see this movie, this video. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=200.82000000000002s)]
*  But I want people to know that I saw it [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=204.58s)]
*  and I can testify to exactly what you're talking about. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=207.9s)]
*  I want to talk about the hostages, though, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=211.10000000000002s)]
*  because we all remember Gilad Shalit and one IDF soldier [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  who was there for six or seven years being held by Hamas. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=218.9s)]
*  He was traded for 1,000 Palestinians. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=222.34s)]
*  Now we have 229. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=224.82000000000002s)]
*  And Israel says 12 of them are Americans, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=226.94000000000003s)]
*  which our government has not confirmed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=231.06s)]
*  What is going to happen to these hostages [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=234.18s)]
*  when the Israeli military goes in full force? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=236.58s)]
*  And we're already seeing the bombing that's happening in Gaza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=240.3s)]
*  Who knows what's happening to those hostages now? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=242.94000000000003s)]
*  So one of the goals of our operation [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=246.3s)]
*  is to free the hostages and bring them all home. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=248.46s)]
*  And we believe that is best achieved [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=251.78s)]
*  by hitting Hamas and hitting Hamas hard. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=254.78s)]
*  And we've also said very clearly, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=258.5s)]
*  and we said again tonight, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=260.1s)]
*  anyone in Hamas who's involved in harming one of those hostages, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=262.26s)]
*  one of those 229 hostages, anyone involved in hurting them, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=266.74s)]
*  we will find them and we will punish them. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=271.5s)]
*  It might take a month, it might take a year, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=274.58s)]
*  it might take 20 years, we will find them [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=276.5s)]
*  and we will mete out justice. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=278.94s)]
*  You hurt those hostages, you will pay a price. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=280.78s)]
*  Now we're going to keep the pressure up on Hamas. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=284.97999999999996s)]
*  The pressure will be on them until our operational aims are met. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=287.26s)]
*  And that is the release of all the hostages [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=291.21999999999997s)]
*  and the end of this terror regime, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=294.74s)]
*  this enclave of terrorism and slaughter in the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=296.62s)]
*  When it's over, everyone will be better off. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=301.34s)]
*  Ambassador Reuters reports that there are 12 American hostages, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  as I mentioned. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=309.62s)]
*  We have heard from the White House [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=311.34000000000003s)]
*  that there are a handful of Americans [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=313.02000000000004s)]
*  and they're not calling them hostages, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=315.62s)]
*  they're saying they're unaccounted for. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=317.06s)]
*  Can you confirm, are there 12 Americans [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=319.3s)]
*  who are among these hostages who are being held in Gaza? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=322.3s)]
*  Can I say, Martha, some of the information remains unclear. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=327.38s)]
*  There are still people who are missing [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=332.1s)]
*  and we don't know if they're dead or in Gaza. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=334.5s)]
*  There are still bodies, to be very frank, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=336.74s)]
*  that are so badly burnt that they're difficult to identify. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=338.46s)]
*  I mean, Hamas literally turned people into ash. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=342.94s)]
*  And we have trouble identifying exactly sometimes [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=346.38s)]
*  who we're talking about. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=351.22s)]
*  So there is a certain amount of unclarity [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=351.86s)]
*  and I apologize for that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=354.66s)]
*  I can't give you exact numbers. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=355.86s)]
*  As you've seen over the last few days, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=358.06s)]
*  despite the releases of those two women [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=359.74s)]
*  and then the other two women, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=362.58s)]
*  the number of hostages has gone up [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=365.06s)]
*  because we're always finding new information [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=366.86s)]
*  through intelligence and other sources. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=368.74s)]
*  And so I'm afraid I can't be more specific [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=370.86s)]
*  on the numbers that you want at this stage, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=373.02s)]
*  only to tell you, at this stage, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=374.5s)]
*  we know there are 229 hostages still held in Gaza [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=376.46s)]
*  and they are being held by Hamas, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  which is, of course, has shown us all [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=382.14s)]
*  the brutality it's capable of. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=384.06s)]
*  One last question, Ambassador, before I let you go. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=385.98s)]
*  Will we see, is the idea that the shelling [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=388.5s)]
*  will force them to say, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=392.86s)]
*  okay, we're gonna release hostages to get this to stop [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=395.18s)]
*  because we've heard from the White House [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=398.18s)]
*  that they would consider encouraging pauses [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=399.7s)]
*  to release hostages? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=402.5s)]
*  Or would we ever see a trade for Palestinian prisoners [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=404.14s)]
*  again for hostages? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=410.18s)]
*  Will we ever see anything like that again? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=411.94s)]
*  Malthus, the key here in our understanding [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=414.94s)]
*  is just to keep the pressure up on Hamas. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=417.3s)]
*  When that pressure becomes unbearable for them, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=419.82s)]
*  maybe we'll see some movement. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=422.66s)]
*  Okay, Ambassador Regev, thank you very much, sir. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2WtrEz7Q-8&t=424.58s)]
