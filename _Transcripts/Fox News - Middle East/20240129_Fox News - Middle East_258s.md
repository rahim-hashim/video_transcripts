# Biden admin will not respond aggressively at all: Ex-Trump official
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M)
*  Let's bring in Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg, Fox News contributor and former national security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=0.0s)]
*  advisor to Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=3.6s)]
*  Sir, welcome to you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=5.32s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=6.4s)]
*  The U.S. will respond at a time of its choosing, says John Kirby. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=7.4s)]
*  American soldiers are now dead. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  We have over 160 attacks that have happened. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=14.98s)]
*  If not now, when? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=18.28s)]
*  Yeah, Sandra, thanks for having me. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=20.28s)]
*  My reaction to listening to Admiral Kirby is, uh-oh, he has telegraphed something. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=22.96s)]
*  There's a real tell here. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=29.0s)]
*  They are not going to respond very aggressively at all. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=30.38s)]
*  And you can see, because he sits in the councils, when the national security team meets in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=33.6s)]
*  Situation Room, he's there, and he has heard the president. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=37.84s)]
*  And the president will give his guidance, commanders intent, and he'll say, these are [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=41.34s)]
*  the limits I want to look at, left limits, right limits. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=44.96s)]
*  And then the Defense Department, the State Department, the Defense Intelligence Agency, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=47.58s)]
*  all of them come in, and they give them their responses and their options out there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=51.32s)]
*  And he was giving you the tell. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=54.92s)]
*  And the tell was, no escalation, no war with Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=56.52s)]
*  So it's going to be a lot less than what you or I might have imagined it's going to be. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  And that concerns me greatly, because I was hoping, thinking, believing that maybe they [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=64.44s)]
*  were going to try to respond hard enough to bring everything back into a box and have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=70.04s)]
*  some containment in the Middle East. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=74.44s)]
*  Look, I'll go back to 1988, when the USS Samuel Roberts, which was a frigate, hit a [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=76.36s)]
*  mine in the Persian Gulf, wounded, not killed, wounded 10 sailors. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=82.44s)]
*  President Reagan eliminated half of the Iranian Navy. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=87.8s)]
*  And this is the response that you have to give. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=92.44s)]
*  The Iranians are kind of expecting this, because if you read what the Iranians just said, they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=94.6s)]
*  said, oh, this wasn't us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=99.0s)]
*  Don't blame us. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=100.44s)]
*  They're a little bit nervous right now with the reaction it's going to be. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=101.44s)]
*  And I believe listening to Kirby and where he was probably sitting at and the guidance [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=104.18s)]
*  from the president, it will not be an escalatory response, a hard response. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=109.82s)]
*  It'll be a muted response. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=113.69999999999999s)]
*  And we're back into the game where we've been before. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=115.3s)]
*  And you're going to lose soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines again until they finally say [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=117.46s)]
*  enough is enough and bring some discipline to this to this area. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=122.13999999999999s)]
*  And they're not going to, based on what I'm hearing. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=125.58s)]
*  General, as far as the actual response, if you were to detail precisely to Iran how you [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=128.78s)]
*  would respond to this attack, what would it be? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=136.3s)]
*  Well, I'd send a very clear message. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=139.46s)]
*  And the very clear message I send is both counter value targets that you're coming after [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=141.58s)]
*  if you need to. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=147.02s)]
*  And you're basically saying we're going after personnel and we're going to go after equipment. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=148.02s)]
*  We're going after facilities. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=150.9s)]
*  And you make it a super escalatory response. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=152.38000000000002s)]
*  The reason is it's not because just what happened there at Tower 22, but it's what's happening [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=154.78s)]
*  in the region and what's happening with Russia, what's happening with China. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=160.58s)]
*  You've got to send a message that enough is enough and we're not going to tolerate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=165.08s)]
*  it unless you do this, what I call super escalation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=168.28s)]
*  You go to a level where everybody's uncomfortable to include sitting in the situation room and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=171.8s)]
*  you understand the level of risk and there would be risk and you have to understand you're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=176.44s)]
*  probably going after maybe a campaign. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=180.5s)]
*  But you tell the supreme leader he's vulnerable. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=183.02s)]
*  You say that Fordo, their nuclear facility, their development facility where they're enriching [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=185.8s)]
*  uranium, that's a target as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=190.76000000000002s)]
*  The ships are targets. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=193.24s)]
*  And then you actually go after them and you understand that it may be a second round or [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=194.66s)]
*  a third round or a fourth round because the only way you're going to bring this back online [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=198.34s)]
*  with an organization that's a terrorist state, that is Iran, is you must hit and you must [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=202.54s)]
*  hit hard. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=207.18s)]
*  And if you don't do it, they're going to respond and they're going to continue to respond. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=208.18s)]
*  So my point is quite simple. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=212.02s)]
*  Bring me in a target list, a very heavy target list, and I'll make the hard decision, understanding [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  the risk, understanding the consequences of that and go forward with it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=218.5s)]
*  That means either personnel, equipment, facilities, whatever they've got. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=223.42s)]
*  There is obviously a lot at stake here. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=227.94s)]
*  General Keith Kellogg joining us on the breaking news out of the White House. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=231.78s)]
*  As that briefing is ongoing, we'll continue to monitor that and our thanks to Jason Chaffetz [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=234.54s)]

*  General, thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=240.1s)]
*  Thanks, Sandra. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rd6kG2O6O8M&t=241.1s)]
