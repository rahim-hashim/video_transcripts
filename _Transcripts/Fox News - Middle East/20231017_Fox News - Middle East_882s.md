# '60 Minutes' ripped for 'crazy' softball questions to Biden
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y)
*  And I cannot wait to get Michael Goodwin's take on this. Michael joins us now. Michael, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  with everything that you've seen, with all the crises that we had, including the 9-11 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=4.72s)]
*  attacks here in New York City, how disturbed are you by the series of events since October 7th and [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=8.56s)]
*  beyond? Well, good morning, Brian. Look, I think we're entering a new phase of world history. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=14.48s)]
*  And I think a lot of the trends that we've seen and that you and I have discussed, I mean, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=23.04s)]
*  the emergence of China, the brazen threats against the West, against Taiwan, the war in Ukraine, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=28.56s)]
*  the invasion, trying to gobble up, Putin trying to recreate parts of the Soviet Union, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=35.28s)]
*  Iran with its nuclear weapons push, with its terrorism around the region. I think these things [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=42.72s)]
*  are all coming to fruition. And it looks to me like the world, the axis of evil, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=50.72s)]
*  the Russia, the China, the Iran, the North Korea, they're making a move. And it's not necessarily [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=61.2s)]
*  all coordinated, but I think it all stems from the same thing. They're feeling emboldened, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=68.16s)]
*  and they look at America and feel that America is in decline, which most Americans agree with, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=74.72s)]
*  and they feel that America is weak. And I think most Americans would probably agree with that, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=80.96s)]
*  that we have put weakness front and center to the world. And so Israel, of course, being [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  a vulnerable outpost of the West, if you want to see it in large geostrategic terms, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=97.44s)]
*  and I think Israel looks very vulnerable right now. I think the question of whether Hezbollah [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=106.72s)]
*  is going to open the second front, whether now is the time when Iran goes for the kill. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=114.16s)]
*  And I think that's clearly what the Hamas attack signaled, that Israel looked weak. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=122.08s)]
*  Israel was not ready. And I think when you display weakness, as Israel did, by not seeing this plot, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=128.4s)]
*  by not catching it and detecting it and being able to stop it, it emboldens your enemies. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=139.12s)]
*  And so I think we're living in a very precarious time, Brian. It's not hard to imagine [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=144.96s)]
*  that we're in this early innings of new developments that really shake to the core [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=150.24s)]
*  everything we believe about our own country's strength and power and its place in the world. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=157.44s)]
*  A couple of things. Just to back up, the AP did a poll. 78% of our countries say our nation is off [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=163.52s)]
*  course. And I think that's a correct statement, off course, easy to put back, because we have the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  wrong leadership making terrible choices. Who would ever think it's a good news to double our [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=175.36s)]
*  deficit by spending money we don't have on green projects that don't work? Who would ever think [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=181.28s)]
*  it's a good idea to open our borders and blame Congress when you know you did it yourself? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=186.4s)]
*  Who would ever think it's a good idea to make the serving of the military so unpalatable, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=192.16000000000003s)]
*  even the families who traditionally have served are telling their next generation not to be in it? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  To me, and yet we still are growing, yet we still have the biggest armed forces in the world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=204.16s)]
*  We still have the most talent. We still have the best track record. So I do think with the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=210.8s)]
*  right leadership, it's easy to course correct and start redirecting our energy to use our own [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=215.04s)]
*  resources and start building some pride in our armed forces to prevent the next conflict. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=222.07999999999998s)]
*  I do say this, I had General Spalding on today, and he believes this is all coordinated. Hamas [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  hitting the Ukraine invasion, and he believes that China's next movie to take Taiwan or tell [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  North Korea to start blitzing South Korea because they want us strung out. Do you think they're that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=241.28s)]
*  coordinated? Well, I actually don't believe it's coordinated, but I think it is connected [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=247.04000000000002s)]
*  in the sense that they see each of these rogue nations seize the path forward and that America [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=254.24s)]
*  is slow to react. I have to say, Brian, although Joe Biden gave that second speech he made on [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=264.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel, it was a good speech except he left out Iran and the anti-Semitism at home, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=275.04s)]
*  because probably because he doesn't want to stir the Iran nest. He doesn't want to confront [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=283.12s)]
*  what a failure his policy is, and the anti-Semitism is coming largely from the left, his own party, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=290.23999999999995s)]
*  and so he's been slow to react to that. But then in subsequent days, he has said different things. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=297.91999999999996s)]
*  For example, the idea that it would be a mistake for Israel to occupy Gaza or that it has to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=305.28s)]
*  be careful, not about civilians. All that's fine, except what are you really saying? What are you [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=312.8s)]
*  supporting? What's your policy? How far do you believe Israel can and should go? Because if [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=320.0s)]
*  Israel is successful in decapitating Hamas, then what? Does Israel just pull back again out of [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=327.04s)]
*  Gaza? Well, what happens in Gaza? I mean, there will be a new Hamas. There will be a new takeover. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=335.52s)]
*  Absolutely. This is the fan of things that are very complicated, and Joe Biden, he looks like [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=340.88s)]
*  he's half asleep all the time. I mean, I'm watching him on Sunday. Do you know what Scott Pelley said [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=346.24s)]
*  leading up to that interview? The president had a busy day and they told us when he gets tired, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=350.8s)]
*  he goes back to his stuttering. Excuse me? You're making excuses for the president before their [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=356.0s)]
*  interview where you gave him a series of layups? What would you say to Iran if they told you [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=361.04s)]
*  that they were going to attack Israel? Don't. Wow. Let's send that clip out and make the president [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=367.20000000000005s)]
*  look tough. Why don't you just add kettle drums and make him sound like he's the next incarnation [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  of FDR? Well, it's funny you mention that because I had the same reaction, or similar I should say, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=378.24s)]
*  in the sense that Scott Pelley seemed to be asking him just yes or no questions. They were, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=384.32s)]
*  do you believe it's wrong for blah, blah, blah? Yes. Do you believe it's right for blah, blah, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=391.35999999999996s)]
*  blah, blah? No. I mean, what kind of interview was that? It was crazy. You're supposed to bring out [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=397.2s)]
*  his thinking, not just sort of bake him a cake and ask him if he likes it or not. And what about [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  this? I want you to hear this clip and I'm not going to lead the witness. I want you to hear this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  Cut for it. Given these two wars and the dysfunction in Congress, are you sure [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=416.08000000000004s)]
*  that you want to run again? Yes, because I'm sure. Look, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=423.44s)]
*  when I ran, I said the world's at an inflection point. The world's changing, but we have an [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=430.88s)]
*  opportunity to make it. So imagine if we were able to succeed in getting the Middle East put in place [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=436.72s)]
*  where we have normalization of relations. I think we can do that. So I just want you to let that [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=443.2s)]
*  ruminate for a second. Can you bring me through the question and the answer? Well, I mean, it's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=450.4s)]
*  sort of he cannot finish a complete sentence. So he switches midstream and then he always reflects [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=456.64s)]
*  back to the past. When I decided to run, it was because, I mean, in other words, it's a hodgepodge [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=465.84s)]
*  and there's never a complete thought in it. There's never a real answer. He's just, he's not [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=473.76s)]
*  functioning like an adult who has had all these experiences and draws on them. He cannot communicate [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=479.84s)]
*  the basic things. And I think it's very disheartening for America. I mean, where are we going? This guy's, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=489.28s)]
*  would you let him fly a plane? We're on this great plane of America. Can he really be the pilot? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=495.44s)]
*  So the question was, is the world worthy of you serving another four years? How about this, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=503.28s)]
*  Mr. President, you're 80 years old or 82. You'll be 86 by the end with these crises and the need [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=509.28s)]
*  for maybe 20 hour workdays. You couldn't handle a three hour workday. You needed a precursor to say [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=518.4s)]
*  you might start stuttering again. I mean, to me, not to bring up age with that question, number one. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=524.4s)]
*  Number two is he's the one who screwed up what was coming in to a series of alliances called the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=529.4399999999999s)]
*  Abraham Accords. He's the one who made Saudi Arabia a pariah nation, stopping the Abraham Accords. He's [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=535.12s)]
*  the one who took the Houthi rebels off the terror list to a lobbing rockets into Saudi Arabia and [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=541.04s)]
*  backing up Iran to get them back into this deal, screwing up the Abraham Accords. It was only after [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=546.0s)]
*  two and a half years and a reapproachment and a realignment because they had no choice that they [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=551.68s)]
*  went back to Saudi Arabia, but that they were considering doing that. Do you know you could not [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=557.1999999999999s)]
*  mention the Abraham Accords in the White House and now this guy thinks he's going to be the author of [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=561.28s)]
*  a realignment of the Middle East when it was handed to him? Well, you're right that the White House [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=565.5999999999999s)]
*  wouldn't even use the words Abraham Accords, neither would the State Department. Look, Brian, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=572.56s)]
*  I think if there's one key to all of this failure, it is the Democrats, starting with Obama and then [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=579.2s)]
*  Biden, treatment of Iran. They have enriched Iran. They have effectively dismantled the sanctions, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=587.84s)]
*  and Iran is now a richer country. But all of that money or most of that money, whether it's [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=595.84s)]
*  lifting of sanctions or unfreezing cash, all of that money has gone not to help the people of Iran, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=603.92s)]
*  it's gone to fund Hezbollah, to fund Hamas, to fund the Houthis that were attacking Saudi Arabia. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=613.36s)]
*  That is what Iran is. Henry Kissinger said many years ago, Iran has to decide if it's a country [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=624.0s)]
*  or a cause. And I think we can safely say Iran is still a cause. It is still a revolutionary cause [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=630.56s)]
*  throughout the region and throughout the world. But Joe Biden doesn't even see it that way. He [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=639.3599999999999s)]
*  doesn't see what's happening. He keeps acting as if, as did Obama, oh, we can sweet talk them. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=645.1199999999999s)]
*  We can just bring them into the fold and they'll see the advantages of being part of the [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=651.92s)]
*  the international rules-based system. They talk as though that there is some magic to this. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=658.0s)]
*  These people only understand force. They are about killing and destroying. You cannot sweet talk them, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=666.48s)]
*  as frankly Israel learned with Hamas. So what I'm worried about, Michael, I'm worried about [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=675.2s)]
*  that delay over the weekend wasn't weather related. I'm worried that they were already [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=679.6800000000001s)]
*  trying to tie the hands of Israel. Are you? You mean the delay in the fight and the invasion? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=683.44s)]
*  I fear that we're already trying to tie their hands because of the humanitarian casualties that [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=695.44s)]
*  or the civilian casualties that could take place. I have a somewhat different view. I think you're [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=702.6400000000001s)]
*  right. Biden is trying to tie Israel's hands and limit what they can do. But I do think that [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=708.56s)]
*  Israel needs to be very careful, of course, in terms of civilian casualties. But it's sort of [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=714.9599999999999s)]
*  what happens next. If you go in there heavy, obviously you may or may not get the hostages. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=722.16s)]
*  You will certainly lose some of your own soldiers. It will be a very destructive act. But even if you [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=731.68s)]
*  succeed, then what? What do you do? And I think that is a problem. I'm not sure Israel has the [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=738.24s)]
*  answer to that because it pulled out of Gaza in 2005, 2006, and wanted nothing to do with it. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  Would love to have a peaceful relationship with Gaza. But the problem is Gaza became the home of [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=752.48s)]
*  Hamas. Hamas runs Gaza. Everything about Gaza is controlled by Hamas. That's one of the reasons why [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=760.08s)]
*  Israel did not have good intelligence. I think it has no human intelligence in Gaza anymore. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=767.84s)]
*  I think they've all been killed. I think anyone who showed any sympathy to Israel, any kind of [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=774.32s)]
*  affiliation, was killed. So I think if Israel is going to take over Gaza, it's going to inherit [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=780.6400000000001s)]
*  a two million population, and it's going to have to provide services while protecting against [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=788.72s)]
*  the emergence of a new Hamas. So I think it's a very tricky situation. Even if Israel succeeds, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=796.1600000000001s)]
*  then what? So yeah, I think that they killed about five or six commanders already, so they had [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=803.44s)]
*  somewhat intelligence. Here's an example of why I can't wait for the Biden administration to be [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=809.0400000000001s)]
*  voted right out. They have just agreed to ease sanctions on Venezuela in exchange for freer [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=813.84s)]
*  elections on their oil industry, the dirtiest oil in the world. They're going to be able to sell it [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=820.1600000000001s)]
*  freely and maybe starting to bulk up their economy and put them more in power, as long as they [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=825.6s)]
*  promise more free elections. So again, making friends with our enemies and thinking they're [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=832.32s)]
*  going to win them over. Why? Because he's not pumping oil, but he wants to buy it from them. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=838.48s)]
*  And how many Venezuelans have come across our southern border? I mean, a million? [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=843.52s)]
*  800,000? And they get to stay now. Yeah. I mean, none of this makes sense, right? These two things [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=849.28s)]
*  are at odds with each other. And yet that's the policy. It's sort of ad hoc. I mean, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=855.76s)]
*  Jake Sullivan is terrible. I mean, he's just wrong about everything. He talks about all the [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=862.9599999999999s)]
*  Mideast and has never been so calm. Well, the only thing, remember, we should have known what to [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=868.16s)]
*  expect. He was working against the Trump administration pushing that old Russia narrative. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=872.0s)]
*  Michael Goodman will have to end it there. Right. Thanks so much. Back with your calls in just a [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=876.8000000000001s)]
*  moment. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Pp3IjcqW6Y&t=881.44s)]
