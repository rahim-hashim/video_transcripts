# US military MQ-9 Reaper shot down off coast of Yemen
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug)
*  All right, some updated news right now on some violent incidents certainly happening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=0.0s)]
*  in the Middle East right now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=5.88s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin can update you on that. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=7.04s)]
*  Jennifer? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Neil, we just received this breaking news, but Fox News can confirm that off of the coast [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  of Yemen a U.S. MQ-9 Reaper drone was shot down earlier today. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=15.4s)]
*  A senior U.S. defense official said in a statement to us moments ago, quote, we can confirm that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=20.92s)]
*  a U.S. military MQ-9 remotely piloted aircraft was shot down while in international airspace [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=26.82s)]
*  over international waters off the coast of Yemen. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=32.56s)]
*  U.S. Central Command officials are assessing the incident, we're told. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=35.66s)]
*  According to multiple defense officials who I spoke to earlier today, the MQ-9 Reaper [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=40.22s)]
*  was conducting surveillance over Yemen when a Houthi militia likely shot down the $32 [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=44.58s)]
*  million U.S. surveillance drone. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=50.74s)]
*  The Houthis put out a video today of the downing of what they said was the downing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=53.02s)]
*  of the American Reaper, most likely with an SA-6 surface-to-air missile. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=57.1s)]
*  The Houthis last shot down an MQ-9 Reaper on June 6, 2019. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=61.96s)]
*  The Reapers are flown generally out of a U.S. air base in Djibouti. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=67.04s)]
*  On October 19, 2023, you'll remember, Neil, that the USS Carney, which was in the Red Sea [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=71.62s)]
*  at the time, shot down 15 drones that were fired from Yemen, four cruise missiles that [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=77.38s)]
*  were heading towards Eilat in Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=82.7s)]
*  If those drones had actually landed or cruise missiles had landed in Eilat, it could have [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=87.94s)]
*  escalated the conflict quite significantly. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=91.5s)]
*  Iran has long backed the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=94.54s)]
*  They're primarily—these MQ-9 Reapers are primarily used to collect intelligence, but [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=96.66s)]
*  they are armed with—can be armed with eight laser-guided Hellfire missiles, according [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=101.34s)]
*  to the Air Force. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  They use sophisticated cameras, sensors, radars to collect intelligence. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=107.22s)]
*  It's a high-powered camera and can detect heat and operate with very little to no light. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=111.5s)]
*  They can loiter for 27 hours at over 25,000 feet. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=116.46s)]
*  Neil? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=119.78s)]
*  And, of course, the Houthis are financed not just in part by Iran. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=120.78s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  Iran has been backing the Houthis as part of that civil war in Yemen. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=127.17999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. has been engaged in Yemen going after al-Qaeda. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=131.98s)]
*  But now the surveillance drones that are in the air, the MQ-9s, they most likely are [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=135.58s)]
*  watching to see if the Houthis are planning any attacks or firing any of those missiles [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=140.66000000000003s)]
*  towards Israel, because that could significantly escalate the conflict. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=147.22000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=151.66000000000003s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOUm1Ok9lug&t=152.66000000000003s)]
