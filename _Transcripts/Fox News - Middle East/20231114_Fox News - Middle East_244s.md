# This is just a bad strategy all around: Retired general
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk)
*  Folks, U.S. forces in the Middle East have been attacked by Iran proxies more than 50 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=0.0s)]
*  times this month, and we've responded three times. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=4.88s)]
*  The big question, obviously, is that enough? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=7.76s)]
*  Retired Air Force Brigadier General Rob Spalding joins me now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=9.56s)]
*  General, yeah, you know, it's hard to discern the size of the attacks and retaliation, how [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=13.0s)]
*  big those are, but the numbers certainly seem off to me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=18.84s)]
*  Well, yeah, and we're getting ready to have, people need to pay attention to this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  We're getting ready to have the meeting that's going to call for peace in our time with Xi [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=28.48s)]
*  and Biden in San Francisco, and you're seeing all these attacks in the Middle East, and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=32.64s)]
*  there is a connection between the two because the Chinese are supporting Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=37.84s)]
*  So if we think that this is going to tone down because of the meeting in San Francisco, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=41.68s)]
*  it's not. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=46.6s)]
*  It's going to increase. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=47.6s)]
*  And unfortunately, the way we've responded is going directly after the proxies is not [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=48.6s)]
*  going to deter Iran from increasing attacks in the region. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=52.8s)]
*  These proxies, I mean, to be quite frank, are just pawns for Iran, right? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=57.4s)]
*  I mean, they're almost disposable for them, and so hence 50 attacks. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=59.4s)]
*  And if we don't, how do we deter it? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=64.39999999999999s)]
*  I mean, obviously, three retaliatory attacks would not be enough, it doesn't seem, but [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=67.2s)]
*  it seems we're really nervous. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=71.88s)]
*  I haven't heard anyone confirm, you know, Iran's involvement. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=73.4s)]
*  Everyone thinks it's happening, but our government seems really loathed to make that connection. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=77.6s)]
*  Well, it's like going after the pizza delivery guy for delivering pizzas. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=83.36s)]
*  You've got to go after the owner of the pizza company, and that's Iran. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=87.72s)]
*  That's the leadership of Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=91.64s)]
*  And if we don't go after them, we're not going to stop these attacks in the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  And I've said it before, but more importantly, they're getting resources to enable their [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=97.84s)]
*  proxies through China. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=104.0s)]
*  So just like the Russian-Ukraine war, the Russians are getting resources from China, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=105.68s)]
*  so we're sending money to Ukraine, but at the same time, we're sending money to China, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=111.24s)]
*  who's then in turn sending it to Russia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=116.36s)]
*  So we're feeding our own fire here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  You actually put out a great article. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=121.44s)]
*  This is April 19, 2022, and you talked about Russia and China ramping up a new war, a new [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=124.03999999999999s)]
*  Cold War. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=129.88s)]
*  Is this the hot elements of that new Cold War? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=131.6s)]
*  Well, if you remember, we had the Korean War, we had the Vietnam War, of course. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=135.52s)]
*  You had Czechoslovakia during the Cold War. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=141.52s)]
*  So there are going to be what I would call proxy wars. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=145.12s)]
*  And Russia's invasion of Ukraine was the first of the Second Cold War. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=149.32s)]
*  And Hamas's invasion and the really terrible, horrific things they accomplished in Israel [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=153.36s)]
*  is, I believe, the second, and we're still waiting on the third shoe to drop. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=160.84s)]
*  You know, Biden thinks he's going to get some kind of concessions out of Xi. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=165.16s)]
*  I think they're just like when Japan was meeting here prior to Pearl Harbor, we're going to [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=168.92s)]
*  get the same kind of results from China. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=175.12s)]
*  And before I let you go to that point, it feels like those concessions are going to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=177.72s)]
*  be things like pledges about climate change and things like that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=180.76s)]
*  I mean, the agenda, the climate change agenda superseding everything, including our economy, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=183.95999999999998s)]
*  America's well-being and the safety of the world is fascinating to me. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=189.32000000000002s)]
*  I just can't believe how in they've gone with this sort of ideology that's put everything else at risk. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=193.16s)]
*  Well, yeah. And so, by the way, we're going to shut down our energy production while the Chinese [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=200.52s)]
*  are ramping up coal production and coal fired plants. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  So basically, we're strangling our economy to support the Chinese economy who's supporting [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=208.68s)]
*  the wars in the Middle East and in Europe. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  So it's just bad strategy all the way around. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cToyNoQUnRk&t=215.64000000000001s)]
