# Trey Yingst: There are dangerous and unpredictable days ahead
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA)
*  Trey Yanks, on the ground in Israel, where Trey, they're still waiting to see when Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=0.0s)]
*  starts shooting. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=5.26s)]
*  Trey Yanks, The New York Times, The New York Times [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=6.26s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=7.26s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=8.26s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=9.26s)]
*  And this morning, there was yet another Iran-backed attack into this country. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=10.26s)]
*  Drones and rockets being fired just a few miles from here, one hitting near to a car [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=14.8s)]
*  and critically injuring two people. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=19.46s)]
*  It comes as we continue to follow a major story out of the Middle East overnight, where [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=21.8s)]
*  an Iran-backed militia targeted a base in Iraq that was housing American forces. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=26.56s)]
*  We do know multiple U.S. troops were injured. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=32.04s)]
*  We are waiting updates on their conditions. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=34.5s)]
*  The attack does mark the 219th time that U.S. forces were targeted in the Middle East since [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=37.2s)]
*  October. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=42.959999999999994s)]
*  And the timing of this incident that occurred at the Al-Assad Air Base in Western Iraq couldn't [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=43.959999999999994s)]
*  have come at a more tense time. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=48.0s)]
*  President Biden was at the White House being updated on the expected Iranian attack that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=50.0s)]
*  is being planned against Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=54.16s)]
*  The commander-in-chief posting to X that he was briefed and there are efforts underway [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=56.04s)]
*  to de-escalate. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=59.96s)]
*  Biden goes on to say, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  We also discussed the steps we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  against our personnel in a manner and place of our choosing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=66.72s)]
*  The question now is how the United States will respond and what role the Americans will [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=70.08s)]
*  play in defending Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=73.88s)]
*  Iranian officials briefed foreign ministers of other countries yesterday and confirmed [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=75.92s)]
*  they do plan to strike Israel in response to the killing of Hamas political leader Ismael [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=79.56s)]
*  Haniyeh in Tehran. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=84.08s)]
*  This comes as the war in Gaza grinds on and we are following a new development about the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=85.88s)]
*  United Nations. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=89.56s)]
*  The U.N. announced yesterday it had fired nine UNRWA staffers for suspected involvement [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  in the October 7th massacre. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=95.24s)]
*  Right now there are no diplomatic solutions on the table to end the war in Gaza, de-escalate [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=97.44s)]
*  with Hezbollah or stop Iran from attacking. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=102.36s)]
*  Dangerous and unpredictable days ahead. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=105.28s)]
*  Guys? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=107.28s)]
*  Alright Trey, thank you very much. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6g8Muw-Z3tA&t=108.28s)]
