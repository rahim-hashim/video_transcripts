# PGA tour must be called out for this: Tomi Lahren
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo)
*  Why does the PGA Tour have 23 sponsors within the PGA Tour doing 40 plus billion dollars [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=0.0s)]
*  worth of business with Saudi Arabia? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=8.26s)]
*  Why is it okay for the sponsors? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=11.4s)]
*  Why is it okay, Brian, that there's a Saudi sponsor in Aramco, the largest sponsor of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=13.36s)]
*  women's golf in the world? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=19.6s)]
*  Why is it okay for them? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=21.56s)]
*  Why is it not okay for these players? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=23.06s)]
*  The hypocrisy in all this, it's so loud, it's deafening. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=25.92s)]
*  Raising legitimate questions, live golf CEO Greg Norman blasting critics of the Saudi-funded [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=30.8s)]
*  tour, like broadcasters like Bob Costas, who recently lashed into Phil Mickelson, claiming, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=36.64s)]
*  quote, there are no two ways around it. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=43.92s)]
*  It's blood money, guaranteed money, $200 million for Phil Mickelson, even if he never wins [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=46.28s)]
*  a tournament. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=51.44s)]
*  But what's the price for your soul? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=52.44s)]
*  Man, I liked when he used to just call games. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  What's the price for integrity? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=58.199999999999996s)]
*  This is a clear-cut matter of morality. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=60.12s)]
*  Outkick host Tommy Lahren joins us now. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=62.16s)]
*  Tommy, so great to see you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=64.24s)]
*  We're going to get to your new show in just a moment, but what do you make of this back [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=65.47999999999999s)]
*  and forth accusations? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=69.96s)]
*  Hey, I agree. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=71.96s)]
*  We need to call out hypocrisy in all of its forms. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=74.24s)]
*  We need to call out atrocity in all of their forms. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=76.52s)]
*  So if we're talking about blood money here, would that mean that the NBA and players like [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=78.84s)]
*  King James, LeBron, would that mean that they are playing for blood money because of their [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=83.36s)]
*  continuing cozying up to China? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=87.36s)]
*  Would it be the MLB cozying up to Cuba and also China? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=89.72s)]
*  I mean, my goodness. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=93.28s)]
*  If you're going to start calling out atrocities, let's also call out the numerous players, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=94.52s)]
*  leagues, owners that cozy up to the Black Lives Matter organization that is committed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=98.8s)]
*  to defunding and demonizing police. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=103.6s)]
*  If we're going to call out organizations for atrocities, we're going to call out organizations [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=105.75999999999999s)]
*  for their wrongdoings. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=110.35999999999999s)]
*  We got to be consistent with all of that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=111.84s)]
*  So the uproar that we're seeing about this live golf tour, boy, I just don't seem to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=113.48s)]
*  understand it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=117.72s)]
*  The sports community sure has a conflict of interest when it comes to what they want to [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=118.24s)]
*  call out and what they don't know. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=122.6s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=123.76s)]
*  I mean, don't preach to me about the moral failings of one place where people are making [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=124.52s)]
*  money when you will cover up the moral failings of another example of the communist Chinese [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=129.52s)]
*  so that you can make a lot of money and then try to suppress other people's criticism of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=135.36s)]
*  that in the process. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=140.24s)]
*  That's the two sides of this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=141.24s)]
*  When the PGA Tour clearly has has has run afoul of many of its biggest stars who feel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=143.08s)]
*  like it doesn't represent them well. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=149.56s)]
*  So they're looking for an alternative. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  Well, they certainly are. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=154.96s)]
*  And, you know, there's a lot of discussion to be had about this, and I can see the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=155.84s)]
*  perspectives on both sides. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=159.12s)]
*  But I think it's about the consistency and it's calling things out consistently and not [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=160.72s)]
*  being upset with people making money in one area, but an entire league or organization [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=164.8s)]
*  like the NBA, who makes billions of dollars on their contract with China. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=168.64s)]
*  You got to call all of it out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=172.6s)]
*  But you know what, Pete, I know who would have a really interesting perspective on this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=174.16s)]
*  And I can't wait to talk to him tomorrow on my new show. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=177.64s)]
*  And that is, of course, golf legend John Daly, who's going to join me for my very first [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=180.04s)]
*  show. And I can't wait to ask him about all of this because he knows far more about all [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=184.27999999999997s)]
*  of it than I do. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=188.27999999999997s)]
*  And I can't wait to bring that back to you guys. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, real quick, what are folks going to see on Tommy Lahren is Fearless on Outkick. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=191.44s)]
*  Again, it starts tomorrow 7 p.m. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=195.92s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=198.04s)]
*  Yeah, we're going to call out everything woke and we're going to start with woke sports, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=199.4s)]
*  but woke entertainment, woke corporations, woke media. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=203.4s)]
*  This is an opportunity for me to dive into culture and sports and of course, the same [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=206.36s)]
*  politics that you know and love for me. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=210.6s)]
*  But this is an opportunity for us at Outkick to expand all of that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=212.44s)]
*  And it's going to be fearless and it's going to be uncensored. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=215.76s)]
*  And I can't wait to bring it to you guys. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=218.36s)]
*  Good for you. Congratulations. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=219.92s)]
*  Check out the new show tomorrow. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=221.56s)]
*  Tommy, have a great Sunday. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPG8_ymoZjo&t=222.96s)]
