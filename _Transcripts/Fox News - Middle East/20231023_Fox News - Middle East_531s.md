# Son of Hamas leader issues chilling warning to America
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8)
*  It seems like people are still confused. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=0.0s)]
*  Someone that's not confused is Moshef Youssef. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=1.7s)]
*  He's the son of a founding Hamas leader, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=4.46s)]
*  and he's the author of Son of Hamas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=6.8s)]
*  Thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=8.94s)]
*  You know, I'm always curious, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=10.540000000000001s)]
*  because we have so many Americans here [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  that don't understand Hamas. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=14.34s)]
*  Can you paint the picture for the audience [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=16.52s)]
*  of who we're dealing with? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=18.68s)]
*  Some have referred to them as Israel's ISIS. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=20.86s)]
*  Why do they say this, sir? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=24.96s)]
*  Well, good morning. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=26.4s)]
*  It's the wrong comparison, you know, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=31.0s)]
*  to say Hamas and ISIS, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=36.7s)]
*  because I think Hamas is a lot more dangerous. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=37.94s)]
*  Look at the division and the global confusion [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=40.9s)]
*  because of Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  You know, they brought us to our knees somehow, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=46.14s)]
*  you know, by their brutality and their barbarism. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=50.86s)]
*  You know, brutality is even underestimating Hamas act. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=54.540000000000006s)]
*  Hamas is a religious movement, you know, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  and they are raging a religious movement against Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=65.62s)]
*  This is what they are doing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=70.36s)]
*  The mainstream media cannot say this [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=71.7s)]
*  because they are afraid to ignite a religious war. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=74.60000000000001s)]
*  And what I say, it already is. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=77.5s)]
*  You know, they want to annihilate the Jewish people [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=80.0s)]
*  because they are Jewish people, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=82.44s)]
*  because they are Jewish state. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=83.75999999999999s)]
*  This is why they hate Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=85.44s)]
*  They want to establish an Islamic state [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=86.96s)]
*  on the rebel of the state of Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=89.25999999999999s)]
*  Their campaign title is Tufan al-Aqsa, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  which means the flood of al-Aqsa mosque. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=98.47999999999999s)]
*  So it is a religious situation, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=102.38s)]
*  and we just need to expose them for what they are. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=105.32s)]
*  They are not a national movement. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=107.88s)]
*  If they were a national movement, a political movement, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=110.28s)]
*  you can satisfy their ambition somehow. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=112.82s)]
*  You can negotiate with them. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  But when they are a religious movement, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=118.06s)]
*  that they don't believe even in political borders, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=119.86s)]
*  that they are driven by dark hatred towards a race, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=122.46s)]
*  you know, towards a nation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=128.5s)]
*  And we saw that when they killed people indiscriminately. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=130.8s)]
*  It's all evidence, you know, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=135.22s)]
*  of to what extent Hamas can go. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=138.34s)]
*  Musab, how did you become a Christian? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, because we've talked about it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=143.68s)]
*  It's hard because what we've read, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  what we know about Hamas is they indoctrinate children [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  at an early age. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=151.58s)]
*  And you can let us know if that's correct, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=152.88s)]
*  but to hate other people, to kill the Jews, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  to kill Americans, how do you fight that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=158.62s)]
*  when they have been indoctrinated at an early age? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=161.14000000000001s)]
*  And how did you come to know Christ? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=163.84s)]
*  Well, yeah, this is a good question. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=167.56s)]
*  Well, first of all, I did not become Christian. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=169.66s)]
*  You know, I did not leave Muslim to become Christian. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=171.68s)]
*  I was fascinated and I'm still fascinated [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=174.66s)]
*  by Christ's consciousness, which basically, you know, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=176.8s)]
*  in that region, you know, where hatred is taking over. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, I did not see that our problem was Israel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=187.48s)]
*  I saw that we had a lot more complicated problem [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=190.88s)]
*  within our society. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=194.84s)]
*  And I found the teachings of love and the enemy, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  forgiveness, compassion, the power to be crucified [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=200.64000000000001s)]
*  and stand above pain and stand above misjudgment. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  I saw that there was lots of power to that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=215.4s)]
*  And this is why I made the choices I made. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=218.56s)]
*  I haven't been in a church. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  I lied to you, I'm a church goer. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  I've been in church many, many years now, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=227.94s)]
*  but Christ's consciousness continue to influence me [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=229.66s)]
*  and ignite the light within, you know, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  because we live in a dark world [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=237.82s)]
*  and the men think that they are superior to God, you know, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=240.14000000000001s)]
*  but they are not, you know, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=243.54000000000002s)]
*  actually the why we are in crisis right now, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=244.82s)]
*  because we don't have God in our hearts. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=248.72s)]
*  We have abandoned God and we became very confused. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=251.46s)]
*  And now the enemy attacked us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=255.3s)]
*  Let's talk about the enemy. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=259.0s)]
*  You write in your book and you talk about [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=260.44s)]
*  how your dad was one of the founders [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=263.04s)]
*  and how you had to break from him, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=264.52000000000004s)]
*  saved his life many times, but he still disowned you [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=265.6s)]
*  because he doesn't fully realize that. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=268.16s)]
*  So you start work with the IDF to unearth them [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  and unwind some plots before they happen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=273.16s)]
*  You also write that in 2006, nobody thought that Hamas [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=275.88s)]
*  was capable of taking over the Gaza Strip, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=279.0s)]
*  but they did in two seconds, kick Fatah right out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=281.18s)]
*  Are they capable of putting up [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=284.32s)]
*  and withstanding an IDF invasion? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=286.82s)]
*  Do you think they're that strong [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=289.62s)]
*  or do you think they've already run from the fight? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=290.82s)]
*  Their strength that they are hiding behind [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=299.26s)]
*  children and women and many civilians. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  In fact, this is what they did. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  They surprised Israel on Yom Kippur. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=312.22s)]
*  It's a holiday. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=314.58000000000004s)]
*  And then they ran very quickly [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=316.70000000000005s)]
*  to hide and use human ships. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=321.52000000000004s)]
*  They have many tunnels. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=325.3s)]
*  They used the funds and the aid that came to Gaza. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=327.38000000000005s)]
*  Instead of it went to the people, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=333.86s)]
*  they used it to dig tunnels. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=336.02000000000004s)]
*  And this is what they've been doing, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=339.26000000000005s)]
*  digging tunnels under the ground. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=340.58s)]
*  So it's very hard to deal with this type of suicidal [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=342.78s)]
*  group of fighters who basically don't appreciate life. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=347.58s)]
*  They don't praise life. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=352.46s)]
*  They actually looking forward to death. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  To the next life. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=358.7s)]
*  So this is why it's very hard for, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=359.53999999999996s)]
*  not only for Israel. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=363.09999999999997s)]
*  Do you think they ran, Mursad, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=363.94s)]
*  do you think they're there though? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=364.78s)]
*  Do you think they're still there [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=365.86s)]
*  or do you think they're trying to get out [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=366.94s)]
*  through the Rafa Pass? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=368.16s)]
*  No, no, I think they are still there [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=372.36s)]
*  and they are preparing. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=375.04s)]
*  And the reason that Israel is delaying their campaign [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=376.82000000000005s)]
*  because they're gathering intelligence, [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=380.72s)]
*  I think they should wait a little bit longer [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=382.70000000000005s)]
*  because without intelligence, without information, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=385.32000000000005s)]
*  knowing the tunnels mouths [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=387.8s)]
*  and the Hamas movement on the ground, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=390.6s)]
*  it is going to be a very difficult war. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=393.24s)]
*  Mursad, exit question, a final question for you. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=396.44s)]
*  Ultimately, once the ground invasion does start, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=399.64s)]
*  the goal of the IDF and the Israelis [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=403.12s)]
*  is to rid the world of Hamas, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=405.36s)]
*  which your father founded. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=408.2s)]
*  Given what you've said about how it's a movement, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=410.36s)]
*  not necessarily people, but it's a movement, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=412.8s)]
*  is that possible? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=415.42s)]
*  Yes, it is possible. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=419.26s)]
*  But Gaza front is not the only front. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=420.84s)]
*  First of all, Israel must destroy Hamas infrastructure, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=423.68s)]
*  including the tunnels and whatever it takes, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=428.08s)]
*  whatever it takes, that's number one. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=430.76s)]
*  Number two, Israel need to deal with the head of the snake [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=432.68s)]
*  in Doha, in Beirut, in wherever they are. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=438.12s)]
*  Cut the head of the snake and let the tail die. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=443.36s)]
*  We won't be able to destroy Hamas as an ideology, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=446.2s)]
*  but we can definitely overthrow them. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=449.68s)]
*  Now, I don't know how much this will take. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=451.84s)]
*  This is why I recommend that we gather intelligence [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=455.23999999999995s)]
*  and we enforce a very powerful, unbreachable siege. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=458.32s)]
*  It has to continue for long enough. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=463.28s)]
*  Those tunnels, they need ventilation, they need power, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=466.35999999999996s)]
*  they need communication. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=469.44s)]
*  Now, if we cut the power, fuel, even water, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=471.59999999999997s)]
*  oxygen if possible, long enough, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=477.2s)]
*  this could take long weeks. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=480.22s)]
*  And we know where the tunnels are in general. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=482.86s)]
*  They are close to the siege, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=486.34000000000003s)]
*  they are close to the border with Israel. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=487.94s)]
*  We have offensive tunnels. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=490.98s)]
*  Those we know for sure that the hostages [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=494.26s)]
*  are not in the offensive tunnels. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=496.38s)]
*  They are most likely in tunnels under the city buildings. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=497.98s)]
*  So I think we can begin with the offensive tunnels, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=504.78000000000003s)]
*  destroy those, then we can move to the next stage. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=508.38s)]
*  But we need a very strict, unbreachable siege [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=511.74s)]
*  to deplete the enemy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=516.38s)]
*  If we go in immaturely, then we might pay a very high price. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=518.18s)]
*  Got it. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=522.78s)]
*  Mossad, thank you so much. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=523.62s)]
*  Thanks for coming on and educating us about Hamas. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=525.26s)]
*  You're welcome, and thank you for having me. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=527.18s)]
*  Pick up his book if you wanna find out [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=528.02s)]
*  how this whole thing started. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TdPc4iqLjk8&t=529.46s)]
