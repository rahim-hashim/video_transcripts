# Biden to Iran on imminent attack on Israel: ‘Don’t’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8)
*  How imminent do you think an attack on Israel is from Iran, Mr. President? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to get this information, but my expectation is sooner or later. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=5.0s)]
*  What does your press pitch to Iran in this moment? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=9.0s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=12.0s)]
*  A Fox News alert Joe Biden yesterday with that one word warning to Iran, as the U.S. expects the Iranian regime to strike multiple targets inside Israel in the coming days. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=13.0s)]
*  They're forecasting that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=25.0s)]
*  The White House remains on high alert saying it is in constant communication with Israeli leaders over the prospect of a serious escalation in the region. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=26.0s)]
*  Let's bring in retired U.S. Air Force General Philip Breedlove. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=34.0s)]
*  General, thanks for being here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=37.0s)]
*  So how are those two things congruent? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=39.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=41.0s)]
*  We know we're being told that attack is imminent, the size and scope of which we don't know. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=42.0s)]
*  But yet the president is saying don't? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=47.0s)]
*  So what do we make of all that? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=49.0s)]
*  Well, Pete, thanks for having me back on. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=53.0s)]
*  I think we've said don't more than once recently, and I'm not sure that that's a message that really has standing in the world to these terrorists and to Iran, the backers of the terrorists. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=56.0s)]
*  OK, so if it doesn't have standing, does that mean they escalate at their, you know, based on their calculation of what's beneficial for them? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=70.0s)]
*  Are they even factoring in an American response? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=79.0s)]
*  Or do they think we won't do anything? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=81.0s)]
*  Well, I think that they fear first and foremost an Israeli response. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=84.0s)]
*  I mean, the Hamas, remember Hamas starts in Iran and ends in Iran. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=90.0s)]
*  Hamas is already struck and we're in a war because of their first strike into Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=98.0s)]
*  Israel has forcibly replied. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=105.0s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=108.0s)]
*  I'm fairly certain that Iran does not fear America retaliating in the Middle East. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=109.0s)]
*  I've said more than once that our our policies towards Iran, towards China, Taiwan, towards North Korea, they're all being written in Ukraine. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=117.0s)]
*  And we are not responding in Ukraine either. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=128.0s)]
*  General, when you look at the totality of the threats we face across the globe and at home, what worries you? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=133.0s)]
*  What worries you the most? What has you most concerned when you're putting America first? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=139.0s)]
*  You're looking at America and saying, OK, America's interests are served or not served by the following things happen happening. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=143.0s)]
*  What concerns you? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=149.0s)]
*  So I put us and our forces first all the time. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=151.0s)]
*  My children wear the cloth of this nation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=154.0s)]
*  And I think that what worries me the most is that I see a lack of Western leadership and specifically, you know, I see a retreat of U.S. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=157.0s)]
*  leadership in these larger issues around the world. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=168.0s)]
*  We started off in recent campaigns by saying all the things that we won't do and all the things that that we are afraid of. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=172.0s)]
*  And then we build our reactions and actions based on those statements and those fears. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=182.0s)]
*  And I think the world is watching the leadership dynamic at the at the top of the Western thinking changing. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=188.0s)]
*  Yeah, we're not setting the agenda. You're right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=197.0s)]
*  We're not leading boldly and speaking clearly and acting clearly about what benefits us. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=199.0s)]
*  And as a result, we're sort of whiplashed by all these other prerogatives and look foolish in the process. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=204.0s)]
*  General Philip, we love thank you for your service and the service your family. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=210.0s)]
*  Appreciate you. Thank you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=213.0s)]
*  You got it, sir. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade and I'm Ainsley Earhart. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTChD6Q1is8&t=215.0s)]
