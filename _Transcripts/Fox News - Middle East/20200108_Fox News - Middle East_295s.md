# Joe Manchin says now is the time for diplomacy, civility with Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M)
*  Democratic Senator Joe Manchin live on the hill and Senator good morning to you and thank you. Good morning, Bill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=0.0s)]
*  How are you back here? I'm fine. Thank you for your time. What do you expect to hear from the president senator? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=4.44s)]
*  Well, Bill, I've said this before I said, you know [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=8.84s)]
*  We're the only superpower lift in the world and to be a superpower takes more than just super military might or super financial [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=12.08s)]
*  Might it takes super diplomacy and I think now's the time for the president to show the true super diplomacy [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=19.64s)]
*  That can bring everybody back together and calm this thing down to the point [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=25.84s)]
*  We have so many troops on the front lines so many families who are concerned about their loved ones being in harm's way [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=29.56s)]
*  We owe that to everybody to do everything that we can to bring and ratchet this down if we can [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=36.44s)]
*  We're not going to let Iran have its way if you will [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=41.56s)]
*  But on the other hand we have to understand this was not a surprise the attack last night [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=44.92s)]
*  We knew something was coming. They telegraphed that pretty openly [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=49.8s)]
*  If that was their message and they can save face the diplomacy now should take take shape to where we can get back to some [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=53.8s)]
*  Type of discourse or some type of basically civility that we can work even though we have our differences [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=60.8s)]
*  If you know a full-blown war if you look at a lot of the language from overnight and again today it appears that you're [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  Going to get your wish [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=71.88s)]
*  I don't know if that's the case or not [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=72.52s)]
*  But you look at the tweet from the president and the foreign minister is about serif and he talked about taking [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=73.8s)]
*  Sorry concluded proportionate measures [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=79.52s)]
*  The thing that gives me pause is what the ayatollah said today in Tehran [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=82.04s)]
*  He talked about the discussion about revenge is something else. This was just a slap in the face last night [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=87.44000000000001s)]
*  So language is important. What do you take from that? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=93.72s)]
*  Well language Bill is important on both sides, you know over their language is very important and basically their honor and how they take things [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=96.16000000000001s)]
*  In such a personal way and want to revenge on everything [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=103.04s)]
*  We have to look at it from the standpoint [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=107.2s)]
*  We are the superpower of the world [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=109.12s)]
*  We are the leaders of the world and we are basically the peacekeepers of the world or we have always been that [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=111.76s)]
*  We should continue to strive for that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=117.24s)]
*  but the bottom line is is America has the might to do what it needs to do in order to bring peace about and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=119.4s)]
*  Not just from the standpoint of what I ran and bad actors. I didn't vote for the JCPOA [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=125.12s)]
*  I didn't think that Iran would ever keep its its bargain. I want the president to succeed [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=130.72s)]
*  I want him to work with Congress the president basically has the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=136.79999999999998s)]
*  Responsibility to protect this country and to protect every citizen of this great country of America of ours [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=141.12s)]
*  But also he does not have the right to take us to war without Congress being included in that and that's what we're talking about [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=147.2s)]
*  You know right now you're not suggesting we're [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Headed that way. Are you I am not suggesting that and I sure pray to good Lord that it doesn't go in that direction [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=157.51999999999998s)]
*  But the bottom line is is that we haven't had you know, we keep talking about a UMF [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=163.8s)]
*  Which is authority to use military force and it needs to have Congress's basically involvement in that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=168.52s)]
*  It hasn't been done since 2002 after the 9-eleven attack in 2001 [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=174.52s)]
*  It needs to be reviewed whether it be a Democrat or Republican president. It's not against the President Trump [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  I've said this, you know, I personally like President Trump, but I love my country [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=185.44s)]
*  I would think that we're thinking about our country more than we are [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=190.1s)]
*  Whether it's a Republican or Democrat or who you like and who you dislike. Yeah, two more things bigger than that senator [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=192.78s)]
*  Two more things here. Did you support the killing of Sue Lomani last Friday morning? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=197.78s)]
*  Well, the bottom line was this is a bad actor [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=201.45999999999998s)]
*  This person probably should have been in all of all purposes from from a war a standpoint how he's raised war against Americans and American troops [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=203.72s)]
*  Taken out in some fashion many many years ago. We've known this person's been around in the bad actor for a long time [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=212.12s)]
*  Anything what's hard bill so you want to know what's what's going back on both sides? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=218.78s)]
*  The president hasn't been that fond of the intelligent agencies that we have the 17 all of a sudden now this becomes [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=222.62s)]
*  The gospel and all we're saying is they want to see and I guess hopefully today at 2 o'clock [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  We'll be able to find out what the eminent so that is my understanding you have not been briefed yet [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  But that'll happen this afternoon. Is that right ours happens at 2 o'clock today? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=237.88s)]
*  So it gives you give us some answers because we have all four the top top people [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=240.74s)]
*  Question on that some members of Congress were briefed yesterday [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Have you been privy to any information they were given no that we've had the gang of eight and basically on that level there [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  That's the president and vice president his his his intelligence staff, but they're meeting with the eight [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=253.62s)]
*  leaders basically Democrat Republicans I [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=259.94s)]
*  Just I mean there has to be some civility here and there has to be basically this partisan [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=263.5s)]
*  Divide has to stop bill we can't continue. I'm an American whether I'm a Democrat or Republican [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=268.74s)]
*  I'm an American first and that's what this is about the president Trump is my president [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=274.18s)]
*  I want him to succeed but on the other hand I want him to understand there's three branches of government and we all've got [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=278.62s)]
*  to work together [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=283.5s)]
*  Senator thank you Joe Manchin the Democrat from West Virginia [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=285.3s)]
*  Thanks for coming back and we will speak again very soon and we'll follow up on the briefing you get later today [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=288.26s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Thank you [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2FOb3kcA7M&t=293.46s)]
