# Biden's uncertain response to American hostage crisis draws criticism
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY)
*  The Big Weekend Show begins with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=0.0s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=5.72s)]
*  I'm Nicole Sapphire along with Joey Jones, Alicia Acuna and Joe Concha. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=6.72s)]
*  New video just in of the second wave of hostages released by Hamas just hours ago crossing [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=10.84s)]
*  into Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=16.36s)]
*  These are the faces of the 13 Israelis released ranging in age from 3 years old to 67 years [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=18.0s)]
*  old. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=23.2s)]
*  Also released, 4 foreigners from Thailand. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=24.2s)]
*  And tonight, new video of the two dozen hostages freed by Hamas yesterday on the first day [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=26.96s)]
*  of the deal that includes a break in fighting. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=32.3s)]
*  Now the number of total hostages released climbs to 41. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=35.32s)]
*  195 hostages are still being held by Hamas tonight. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=39.92s)]
*  These freed hostages are signs of hope. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=44.56s)]
*  Like this emotional moment when 9-year-old Ohad ran into his father's arms for a heartwarming [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=46.8s)]
*  hug after 49 days in captivity. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=51.84s)]
*  Jeff Paul is live in southern Israel tonight. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Jeff, good evening. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=58.239999999999995s)]
*  Any word on the American hostages? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=59.48s)]
*  Yeah, so far they are not among the hostages who have been released. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=62.0s)]
*  But we are learning that all 17 hostages who made it out today are either in route to area [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=67.2s)]
*  hospitals or are at the hospital right now. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=73.28s)]
*  The 4-4 nationals who were released are sent to a hospital just outside of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=76.67999999999999s)]
*  12 of the Israeli hostages were sent to the Sheba Medical Center, which is also just outside [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=81.88000000000001s)]
*  of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=86.8s)]
*  But one of the Israeli hostages was sent to a hospital closer to the Egyptian-Israeli [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=88.08s)]
*  border due to her condition. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=93.12s)]
*  She needs a surgery right now, but we are told it is not life-threatening. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=94.72s)]
*  Now today's events just really cap off a very stressful, intense day. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=99.72s)]
*  Unlike the day before, where things ran rather smoothly, today was delayed by 7 hours. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=103.52000000000001s)]
*  And that is in part due to Hamas accusing Israel of them not leading or agreeing to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=109.2s)]
*  their agreement in this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=114.92s)]
*  Hamas says that Israel is not releasing the types of prisoners that they expected, and [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=117.76s)]
*  they also wanted to see more aid head to northern Gaza. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=122.88s)]
*  Israel, though countering and disagreeing with that, saying they are living up to the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  agreement and accused Hamas of engaging in what they called was psychological warfare, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=130.36s)]
*  another example of that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=135.88s)]
*  This really underscores just how tense and how fragile this deal is right now. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=137.44s)]
*  And this is day two. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=142.44s)]
*  We have another two days of what's expected to be a four-day pause in the war, but there [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=143.68s)]
*  are some signals that there could be an appetite to extend this four-day pause. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=149.2s)]
*  Qatar mediators saying that this could be extended a couple days, maybe one or two days. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=154.4s)]
*  The Israeli government has said for every 10 Israeli hostages released, they'll extend [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=159.48s)]
*  that ceasefire. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=164.64s)]
*  We should also note that this time yesterday and the day before, the Israeli government [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=165.64s)]
*  had a list of the names of the people who were expected to be released the following [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  day. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  So far, they don't have that list. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=175.11999999999998s)]
*  We're hoping maybe some Americans this time. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=176.76s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=179.16s)]
*  Jeff Paul, thank you so much. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=180.16s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=182.11999999999998s)]
*  You know, Joey, earlier, an Israeli special ops veteran explained what likely happened [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  in the delay of the transfers hostages today. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=191.64s)]
*  I believe it's because Israel has said to and made it very clear to Hamas that if you [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=194.28s)]
*  do not release the hostages that you agreed to, we will continue and even up the aggression [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=199.48s)]
*  as far as special operations forces on the ground. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=205.56s)]
*  So he was saying that he was believing that there could have been a pause today because [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=209.48s)]
*  of, you know, that Israel has continued to say this is not, you know, this is not going [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=213.8s)]
*  to be the end and they are going to continue their efforts until Hamas is completely destroyed. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=222.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I don't have the text of the ceasefire that was signed by both parties [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=223.88s)]
*  in front of me. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=227.4s)]
*  All we have is what's been reported. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=228.4s)]
*  And I've tried to make good notes because this has been very interesting to me as to [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=229.4s)]
*  what operational or what tactical opportunities and advantages Israel has had to essentially [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=232.96s)]
*  give up in order to get these hostages back, because I felt like even Netanyahu's face [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=239.4s)]
*  and body language when he announced this was very reluctant. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=244.28s)]
*  They probably feel like they're giving up more on the battlefield than we even realize [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  because they probably got them to the negotiating table to give up hostages to begin with because [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=251.4s)]
*  of the pressure they put on them. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=255.96s)]
*  For example, in the original in the original reporting, it was they were not going to surveil [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=257.44s)]
*  may have the North and South throne, but they're not going to surveil half of Gaza at all for [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=262.2s)]
*  the four days. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=266.36s)]
*  And the other half of Gaza, they would they would cut surveillance, I think, during the [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=267.64s)]
*  day, like from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=271.08s)]
*  And so these are things that Israel probably was relying on. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=274.08s)]
*  They may have stuck by that 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=278.04s)]
*  And now Hamas is saying, oh, wait, we saw surveillance drone, so you're not honoring it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=280.32s)]
*  I think there's a lot going on here to where Hamas is realizing they're not going to use [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=284.28s)]
*  hostages to buy their lives back. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=288.08s)]
*  Israel is going to go kill them and they should. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=290.2s)]
*  So, well, Alicia, you know, earlier today, one of the big things that we saw with today, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=293.12s)]
*  yesterday, the hostage release went very smoothly. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=298.24s)]
*  Today, there was this big pause. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=300.44s)]
*  And from a human standpoint, tactically and everything that Joey says is absolutely correct, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  we don't know behind the scenes what happened. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  But this was a stark reminder that Hamas is still in control and there are a lot of innocent [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  lives there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=312.16s)]
*  Earlier today on Fox and Friends Weekend, a former Taliban negotiator, he says, though, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=313.16s)]
*  because as we all know, that Hamas continues to win the information war, they continue [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  to have these sympathizers, that they will continue to release the hostages because they're [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  good at getting good press. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=328.04s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=329.24s)]
*  One thing that Hamas is really good at actually is PR, is making people feel bad, making people [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=331.24s)]
*  forget that they are the ones that caused all of this is what you see. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=338.24s)]
*  And so I think that would be highly unlikely that they would do something like execute [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=343.04s)]
*  hostages because they're much better and much more thoughtful. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  I think you'll see an efficient transfer. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=350.68s)]
*  It's in Hamas's best interest right now to make an efficient transfer. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=352.64s)]
*  And you know, one thing that I think is not getting as much attention, for every one innocent [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=357.36s)]
*  civilian hostage that's being released back to Israel, they're getting about three criminals [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=361.68s)]
*  being released, Palestinian criminals. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=366.56s)]
*  And we're not just talking about petty theft. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=368.16s)]
*  The people who were released today, they had been throwing stones, they had stoned people, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=370.04s)]
*  they were attempting stabbings. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=374.52s)]
*  They are getting three times as many criminals back to Palestine as innocent civilians. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=376.04s)]
*  But that shows you how much the Israelis respect the lives of their civilians. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=380.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=384.48s)]
*  And Hamas knows it more than anything. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=385.48s)]
*  And don't forget, Hamas has been under unrelenting pressure as Israel has responded to the attack [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=387.40000000000003s)]
*  of October 7th. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=393.32s)]
*  They need this ceasefire. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=394.76s)]
*  But when they agreed to release some of the hostages in piecemeal, piece by piece, the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=396.92s)]
*  Israel and all of Israel's allies got to see this moment and feel this moment of relief, [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=402.44s)]
*  of a little bit of hope, right? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=408.76s)]
*  And then we also build on that with a little bit of anticipation for the next group of [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=410.68s)]
*  people to come. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=414.92s)]
*  And that's exactly the moment when Hamas decided that they were going to put everything on [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=416.0s)]
*  pause and take that away and take away that possibility, which again then turns and applies [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=419.88s)]
*  more pressure on Israel to figure it out. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=425.68s)]
*  So Hamas definitely trying to send the message that, yeah, we need this ceasefire, but we're [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=428.6s)]
*  also still in control. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=432.72s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=434.32s)]
*  Joe, so you have young children, I have young children. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=435.32s)]
*  Watching those videos of the little boy and little girl who's going to be reunited with [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=438.88s)]
*  her father tonight, it just warms our heart. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=442.28s)]
*  You'd have to remind yourself of the terror that she had and those who missed her. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=444.88s)]
*  But that's 26 Israelis who have now been returned, 15 Thai foreign nationals have been returned, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=450.2s)]
*  zero Americans. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=455.76s)]
*  When the president was asked about the status of the American hostages yesterday, he said [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=456.76s)]
*  he didn't have an update on them. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=461.84s)]
*  He had no idea. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=463.32s)]
*  Earlier today, he was asked about the American hostages, and this is what he had to say. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=464.32s)]
*  Mr. President, when will the hostages be released? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=469.68s)]
*  I'm hopeful you'll see something soon. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=476.12s)]
*  So he has no update on the status of them. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=479.36s)]
*  He's hopeful maybe we'll see some of them soon. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=481.76s)]
*  Where's the urgency for American lives? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=483.96s)]
*  When you see the president, he's in Antucat at a $34 million estate owned by a billionaire [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  hedge fund boss, the optic is not very good. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=492.08s)]
*  It doesn't look like he's truly on top of the situation. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=495.28s)]
*  He uses the word urgency. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=497.4s)]
*  There should be some urgency here. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=499.23999999999995s)]
*  And what if we listened, by the way, to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Ilan Omar or Rashida Tlaib [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=500.88s)]
*  who are calling for an immediate ceasefire just days after October 7th? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=506.4s)]
*  None of these hostages would be freed right now. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=512.3199999999999s)]
*  But at least here we have 49 days of bad news, horrific news, all the accounts, the videos [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=515.28s)]
*  of people that were slaughtered, beheaded, kidnapped. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=520.3199999999999s)]
*  Now we have relatively good news. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=523.44s)]
*  But we'll talk about the children for a moment. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=525.5600000000001s)]
*  And I look at my kids differently every day as a result of this thinking, well, what if [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=527.44s)]
*  they went through something like this? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=531.0s)]
*  Abigail Idan, she celebrated a birthday yesterday. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=533.2s)]
*  She turned four years old. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=536.4000000000001s)]
*  She is still a hostage being held. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=538.2800000000001s)]
*  And even if she gets freed, she is now going to go home to a home without a mother and [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=540.5200000000001s)]
*  father who were murdered in front of her on October 7th. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=546.24s)]
*  So even if they get freed, it's like going from one hell to another. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=549.76s)]
*  But at least we're seeing some folks, finally, and particularly children, getting freed. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=553.8s)]
*  And again, after seven weeks of just horrible news, we're finally turning a corner and [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=558.48s)]
*  reporting some good stuff, thankfully. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=562.48s)]
*  Well, and Joey, just quickly, the New York Post actually says the first hostage, their [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=564.12s)]
*  headline was, the first hostage being released brings fresh proof that Hamas must be destroyed. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=568.72s)]
*  In it they said, without a doubt, Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad see Biden administration [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=574.08s)]
*  support for Israel as soft. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=578.92s)]
*  They want to make Israel agree to a permanent ceasefire or at least to greatly extend this [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=580.8399999999999s)]
*  one so they can resupply as much as possible. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=585.1999999999999s)]
*  The central fact of this war, Hamas and P.I.J. must be eradicated or the words never again [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=587.88s)]
*  have no meaning left. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=593.5999999999999s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=594.5999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, real quick. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=595.5999999999999s)]
*  I mean, this was my concern when this was first announced, when they announced that [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=596.5999999999999s)]
*  for every 10 hostages released, they'd extend the ceasefire by a day. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=600.0799999999999s)]
*  And they didn't stipulate if all the other parts of it, like the we don't surveil, we're [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=604.52s)]
*  not, in all of that we're a part of it. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=608.72s)]
*  But what if Hamas says, hey, here's a mom and a daughter, or here are two family members, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=610.52s)]
*  we're going to release them. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=614.5400000000001s)]
*  Then Israel says, nope, we're going to bomb you instead. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=615.9s)]
*  That's going to be tough for Israel to keep up if Hamas tries that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=618.52s)]
*  Well, this will continue to unfold and we'll be covering it here. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDHsOfDF9uY&t=621.9200000000001s)]
