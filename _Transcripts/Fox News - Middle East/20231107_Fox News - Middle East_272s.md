# This all started with Barack Obama: Sen. Katie Britt
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s)
*  Here in the U.S., a leaked memo revealing what State Department staffers really think [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=0.0s)]
*  of the White House's response to the conflict in Israel. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=4.72s)]
*  It reads, quote, when Israel supports settler violence and illegal land seizures or employs [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=7.86s)]
*  excessive use of force against Palestinians, we must communicate publicly that this goes [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=13.88s)]
*  against our American values so that Israel does not act with impunity. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=19.6s)]
*  GOP Alabama Senator Katie Britt joins us now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=24.2s)]
*  Senator, thank you for coming in for us. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=27.36s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  You're welcome. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  I really appreciate it. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  What's your reaction to that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=31.880000000000003s)]
*  They're not standing with the president. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=32.88s)]
*  Listen, it seems like they are following Barack Obama, and it's completely and totally unacceptable. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=33.88s)]
*  This is what happens when you have weakness in the White House, when you have a weak commander-in-chief. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=40.88s)]
*  We see what's happening overseas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=45.24s)]
*  We see what's happening at home. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=46.64s)]
*  And here you have people in the State Department. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=48.44s)]
*  We've seen the protesters on the street, but to see that we have them in the State Department [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=50.36s)]
*  is alarming and unacceptable. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=55.2s)]
*  We have to stand firmly with Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=58.34s)]
*  Those people calling for a ceasefire need to realize there was a ceasefire. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=60.580000000000005s)]
*  It was October 6th. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=64.54s)]
*  And Hamas has chosen this path. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=66.28s)]
*  And their path is brutality. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=68.62s)]
*  It is completely and totally beyond comprehension. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=71.06s)]
*  What I saw when I was in Israel two weeks ago. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=73.92s)]
*  And anyone who thinks that they are not going to do this again not only is wildly misled, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  but isn't listening to Hamas. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=82.06s)]
*  They said that they will continue the attacks, just like October 7th, over and over and over [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=83.30000000000001s)]
*  again until they eradicate the Jewish people and the State of Israel. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=88.34s)]
*  And we must stand firm with Israel. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=92.42s)]
*  This is unacceptable. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=93.89999999999999s)]
*  Tell me about your trip. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=94.89999999999999s)]
*  I know Lindsey Graham led this group. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  He did. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=98.22s)]
*  He was bipartisan. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=99.22s)]
*  What did y'all do and what did you see? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=100.22s)]
*  Yeah, Senator Graham did an incredible job. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=101.22s)]
*  He wanted to make sure that people knew both here and abroad that we firmly stand with [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=103.86s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=108.17999999999999s)]
*  But what we saw was unthinkable. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=109.17999999999999s)]
*  Not only did we meet with the families of hostages, which will just absolutely rip your [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=111.14s)]
*  heart out. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  And we need to remind people there are still 200. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  And 40 hostages overseas there in Gaza that Hamas has. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=118.18s)]
*  And we have to make sure that we do everything we can to get them back safely. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=123.94000000000001s)]
*  But also watching the footage, we met with Israeli Minister of Defense. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=127.62s)]
*  We met with everybody over there, the Prime Minister and others. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=133.66s)]
*  And then we watched the footage. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=137.18s)]
*  These sick terrorists are barbaric. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=138.86s)]
*  We watched them murder children in front of their parents. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=142.14000000000001s)]
*  We watched them burn parents alive in front of their kids. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=145.1s)]
*  Rape women pulled their clothes off. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=149.26s)]
*  Bash men's head with sledgehammers. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=151.34s)]
*  It is absolutely unthinkable that anyone could behave like this. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=153.94s)]
*  We must firmly stand with Israel and eradicate Hamas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=158.06s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  Now, you also are doing a book tour this week to talk about your journey. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=162.29999999999998s)]
*  And you grew up in a very small town in Alabama. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=167.18s)]
*  And you have two children back at home, 13 and 14. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=169.94s)]
*  We were talking during the break about living in Washington. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=172.64000000000001s)]
*  Your kids are back home. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=174.96s)]
*  But they supported you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=175.96s)]
*  And that's the title of your book, right? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=176.96s)]
*  That is. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=178.28s)]
*  So my children are why I am doing this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=179.28s)]
*  That's why I'm serving in the United States Senate. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=181.36s)]
*  That's what pushed me to do this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=183.28s)]
*  It's the next generation. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=184.52s)]
*  And that's what this book is about. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  My kids, when I tried to tell them, you know, I don't know if I should run, my son set me [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=187.98s)]
*  down first, then followed by my daughter. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=192.28s)]
*  And when I tried to tell her it was a really hard thing to run for the U.S. Senate, she [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=195.12s)]
*  looked back at me and said, well, mama, doesn't God call you to do hard things? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=198.74s)]
*  And I think right now that message is more important than ever. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=204.24s)]
*  Reaffirming the values that this nation made this nation so great. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=208.5s)]
*  Those of faith, family and freedom. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=211.86s)]
*  Telling life's lessons. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  So a lot of times we see the peaks of people's lives, and particularly in a social media [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=215.38s)]
*  era. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=219.86s)]
*  And I, in this book, talk about my valleys because I believe that's where God carves [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=220.86s)]
*  you up. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=224.66000000000003s)]
*  And if you were honest about how you got there, you're more prepared to walk forward and to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=225.78s)]
*  serve his purpose for you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=230.01999999999998s)]
*  And each of us has a different purpose, but we're called to be in the arena. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  And it is my hope that this book inspires the young and the young at heart to have a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=235.82s)]
*  new lease on life and to be engaged because we need them. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=240.17999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=242.94s)]
*  What a beautiful message. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=243.94s)]
*  You're raising your kids to follow the Lord. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=244.94s)]
*  And I think that's beautiful. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=247.01999999999998s)]
*  The book is called God Calls Us to Do Hard Things, Lessons from the Alabama Wiregrass, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=248.32s)]
*  which is a small little town where she's from close to Doven, Alabama. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=253.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  All right, Senator, thank you so much. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=259.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=260.06s)]
*  And in order to get to the mountain, you got to go through the valleys. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=261.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=262.78000000000003s)]
*  And every generation is called to do hard things. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  I think we see in front of us what ours is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=265.5s)]
*  And it's time to step up. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=267.5s)]
*  Our country needs prayer. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=268.5s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=269.5s)]
*  And strong senators. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=270.5s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=271.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Z5v9Q-IJ0s&t=272.5s)]
