# Only reason there is a potential cease-fire is Trump's message, ex-national security adviser argues
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM)
*  It was very important for the parties to know that the Trump administration stood behind [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=0.0s)]
*  the agreement that we negotiated and that President Biden put forward. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=4.7s)]
*  And I both appreciate and applaud the very good work that Steve Witkoff did, working [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=9.78s)]
*  closely with us, with Brett McGurk, in helping to get this over the line. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=14.94s)]
*  Well, that's Secretary of State Antony Blinken there praising the Trump administration for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=20.22s)]
*  its work on the Israel-Hamas agreement. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=23.900000000000002s)]
*  And also making it clear the Biden administration was responsible for the framework of that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=26.1s)]
*  deal. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  All this as we learn, a vote to approve the ceasefire for hostages deal could happen as [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=31.580000000000002s)]
*  soon as tomorrow. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Robert O'Brien is a former national security adviser. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=37.72s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=40.32s)]
*  Thank you so much, Robert. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=41.32s)]
*  What can you tell us about this deal and whether or not this will eventually fully go through? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=43.1s)]
*  Well, Sandra, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=48.88s)]
*  What we have to figure out is, is Hamas really going to say yes? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=51.900000000000006s)]
*  I mean, we've had we've been at the threshold of a deal for many, many times over the past [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=55.26s)]
*  year and every time Hamas walks away from the deal. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=60.82s)]
*  And so we'll see if the pressure that President Trump has brought on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=64.42s)]
*  And look, the only reason there's a deal, let's be clear about this, and it was nice [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=68.08s)]
*  of Tony Blinken to acknowledge it, is because President Trump sent a message that there'd [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=71.25999999999999s)]
*  be hell to pay on a true social post if the hostages were not released. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=75.38s)]
*  So that's why we may have a deal. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=79.82s)]
*  We have to see if Hamas is going to actually fulfill its part of the bargain. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=82.5s)]
*  So far it hasn't, but they've got until Sunday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=85.78s)]
*  So let's see if they do. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=88.06s)]
*  I hope they do because the families are desperate for these hostages to get home. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=89.06s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=93.14s)]
*  You touched on it just a bit, but credit for the deal and why we are so close or at the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=94.14s)]
*  point that we are right now. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  I asked John Kirby about that last night on Fox Watch. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=100.74000000000001s)]
*  The bottom line was getting the deal, getting the hostages home, getting the war to end. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=105.94s)]
*  And both President-elect Trump and certainly President Biden shared that goal and made [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=110.5s)]
*  sure that their teams also shared that outcome. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=114.86s)]
*  Am I right if I say it sounds like you're giving the president-elect's team a lot of [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=117.14s)]
*  credit for getting this deal over the finish line? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=121.02s)]
*  We're not focused too much on the credit. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=123.94s)]
*  I think, again, as the president said, I mean, we approach this as one team, a team of Americans [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=125.26s)]
*  to try to get Americans back home with their families. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=130.58s)]
*  We approach this as one team, said John Kirby. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=133.42000000000002s)]
*  Want to get your thoughts on that, Robert? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=136.1s)]
*  Well, listen, for a year now, since October 7, a year and a year and a half, Hamas killed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=139.62s)]
*  30 Americans in that attack on October 7. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=144.78s)]
*  They then took a number of American hostages. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=147.3s)]
*  They killed Hirsch Goldberg-Polin with a Marine Expeditionary Unit off the shore. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=149.94s)]
*  They had no fear of America. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=154.38s)]
*  They knew that the worst that would happen to them if they killed Americans is that they'd [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=156.22s)]
*  be sent to tea with Tony Blinken, which, I mean, that may be a punishment, but it certainly [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=158.86s)]
*  isn't going to deter them from taking hostages or killing Americans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=162.98000000000002s)]
*  And it's only when Donald Trump entered the scene, when he won the election, and Hamas [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=167.16s)]
*  realized that they're going to end up like Baghdadi if they don't let these hostages [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=170.6s)]
*  go. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=174.36s)]
*  And I warn the Hamas leaders, both inside and outside Gaza today, you better get these [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=175.36s)]
*  hostages home quickly, because when Donald Trump takes over, if you don't, you're going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=180.56s)]
*  to end up like al-Baghdadi running down a tunnel with a Belgian Malwa dog coming after [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=185.0s)]
*  you if you harm another American. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=189.16s)]
*  So you better fulfill the deal, and not just the first part of the deal, but the entire [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=191.96s)]
*  deal. Let all the Americans come home. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=196.36s)]
*  And otherwise, you're not going to be having tea with Tony Blinken. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  You're going to be facing Delta Force and SEAL Team Six, who are going to come for our [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  hostages. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=206.64000000000001s)]
*  And that is the red line that President-elect Trump has drawn. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=207.4s)]
*  There will be held to pay if these hostages are not back by Inauguration Day. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=210.36s)]
*  This was President Biden when he stepped up to talk about this deal getting done [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  yesterday afternoon. Watch. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=220.96s)]
*  Who is the books credit for this, Mr. President, you or Trump? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=222.76s)]
*  Is that a joke? Oh, thank you. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=229.48s)]
*  Yeah, that was our own Jackie Heinrich, who was able to get that question fired off right [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=233.2s)]
*  there before he departed the room. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=236.79999999999998s)]
*  So so obviously that discussion will continue and perhaps even a debate on that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=238.88s)]
*  But meantime, to your point, it is about the hostages. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=243.88s)]
*  And phase one of this deal couldn't come soon enough for the world that has been praying [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=246.51999999999998s)]
*  for these hostages to come home. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=251.32s)]
*  Robert, what do you see that looking like? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=253.0s)]
*  And how how confident are you that this could happen as soon as Sunday, for example? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm hoping it'll happen by Sunday because frankly, it's a good deal for Hamas. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=262.84s)]
*  Again, the Biden folks put together a deal that was tremendous for Hamas to get a lot [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=266.32s)]
*  of Palestinian killers and terrorists out in exchange for innocent Israelis who are [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=270.03999999999996s)]
*  taking hostage. But I've been to that hostage square in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem where [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=274.4s)]
*  they protest. I've talked to the hostage families. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=279.56s)]
*  I've been to the massacre site of where many of the hostages were taken at the music [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  festival. And those families are desperate. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=286.4s)]
*  So I'm hoping it works out. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  I hope they'll come home. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=290.6s)]
*  But again, we just have to wait and see, Sandra, if Hamas will live up to its word [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=292.32s)]
*  and send them home. If again, if they don't, it's going to be very bad for Hamas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=299.0s)]
*  I can tell you that. Robert, always appreciate when you can join us on the program. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=302.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KEYr57w5_MM&t=306.24s)]
