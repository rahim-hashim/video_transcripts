*  uh... and we are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=157.86s)]
*  has there been anything uh... about the initial attack or the response that has [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=159.22s)]
*  uh... surprised [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=163.5s)]
*  uh... anybody in our government [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=164.74s)]
*  uh... obviously we weren't you know there's there's some things that we're [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=168.46s)]
*  not gonna know about uh... [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=171.82000000000002s)]
*  however uh... it was [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=173.46s)]
*  in many ways we expect we understood what iran's capabilities are you [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=175.46s)]
*  understand for the most part what israel's capabilities are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  uh... and so that would say there any major surprises that's our job not to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=181.62s)]
*  be completely caught off guard to sort of understand the situation in front of [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  us [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=188.22s)]
*  uh... and then calibrate accordingly [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=188.86s)]
*  and provide maximum [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=190.54000000000002s)]
*  decision space to the president united states [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=191.98000000000002s)]
*  uh... to keep america safe so i wouldn't say we were really surprised by any [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=194.22s)]
*  dynamic of the back and forth it's been ongoing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTOumKYpVKY&t=197.42s)]
