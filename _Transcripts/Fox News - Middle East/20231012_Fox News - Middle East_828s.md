# Biden won't utter these words: Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4)
*  Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State and Fox News contributor, so glad to have you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=0.0s)]
*  and all of your CIA experience, all of it, coming to bear with us this hour. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=4.76s)]
*  Thank you, Harris. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=9.84s)]
*  First, I want to start with... [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=10.84s)]
*  Great to be with you this morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=11.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=12.84s)]
*  What Jackie was just saying, because I think it's important, I understand that they can't [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=13.84s)]
*  tell us everything. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=17.72s)]
*  You led the CIA, so you wouldn't want us to know everything anyway. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=18.84s)]
*  It helps the enemy. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=21.68s)]
*  But what do we need to know that you think we're not being told at this point from the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=22.68s)]
*  administration? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=26.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, it took them too long to get on the front foot. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=27.8s)]
*  The fact that we're in this place, the fact that deterrence against the Iranian regime... [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=33.08s)]
*  And Harris, we shouldn't make any mistake about it. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=37.28s)]
*  This is the Iranian regime that is at war with Israel today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=38.8s)]
*  They lost the front foot and we lost deterrence. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=42.96s)]
*  This is where we find ourselves today with Americans dead, eerily reminiscent of Afghanistan. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=45.92s)]
*  We need to know that the administration... [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=51.84s)]
*  We need to know that this administration is serious. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  You were saying they won't tell us about how many Americans there. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=55.68s)]
*  Harris, I remember the work and the reporting you did when they wouldn't tell us about how [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=58.12s)]
*  many Americans were trapped in Afghanistan too, hoping that would just wander off the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=61.04s)]
*  news cycle. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=64.76s)]
*  This is fundamentally indecent what happened. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=66.36s)]
*  This was barbarism. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=68.24s)]
*  This was Iranian barbarism. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=69.48s)]
*  They won't utter those words because it puts them in a place where they have to act. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=71.22s)]
*  And the truth is the world needs to react. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=74.84s)]
*  We need to take this on board in a way that recognizes that what is happening here is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=76.76s)]
*  historic, that the fact that Hamas, the wholly owned subsidy of Iran, has now killed not [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=81.88s)]
*  only thousands of Israelis, but dozens of Americans requires a United States serious [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=86.52s)]
*  response. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=92.19999999999999s)]
*  And I think the president is right. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  He doesn't need to tell us what he's doing to get those Americans released. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  But he damn well better be getting every asset put in place. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=97.84s)]
*  So we're prepared to do that alongside our Israeli partners. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=101.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, it has crept up to 25 dead Americans and U.S. nationals at this point. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=103.96s)]
*  I remember a time when former President Trump said if Iran put its hands and killed one [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=110.0s)]
*  American, they would feel it mightily. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=115.04s)]
*  A paraphrase there, his words much stronger than mine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=118.12s)]
*  We have 25. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=121.28s)]
*  It is the response that is public and there should be one strong enough to indicate that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=123.2s)]
*  this president might feel the same way about the people who want to kill us, terrorists. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=130.44s)]
*  Harris, not at all. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=135.4s)]
*  This is how we find ourselves in this place. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=137.92s)]
*  American failed leadership. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  We did make very clear. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=143.32s)]
*  I communicated, I wrote about this in my book, I communicated directly with Qasem Soleimani [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=144.32s)]
*  and Ayatollah. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=148.48s)]
*  We said, if you kill an American, if you touch an American, we're not going to come after [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=149.48s)]
*  your proxies, whether they be in Lebanon or Syria or Iraq or in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=152.64s)]
*  We're coming after you, the perpetrator of the crime against Americans. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=157.48s)]
*  And this administration can't say that because they've underwritten this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  They gave hundreds of millions of dollars to the Palestinian Authority terrorists themselves. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=164.86s)]
*  They gave billions of dollars in sanctions relief to the Iranians, allowing them to ship [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=169.34s)]
*  four million barrels a day of oil around the world and profit from that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=173.46s)]
*  This administration failed in their Iran policy and now they've got to figure out how to avoid [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  what we know is coming next. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=182.06s)]
*  A continued Iranian effort to undermine not only Israel but the United States of America [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=184.02s)]
*  and the very Abraham Accords that had built out stability and peace in the region. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=189.06s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=193.1s)]
*  A lot to get to with you today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=194.1s)]
*  I do want to get to what Jackie just reported. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=195.5s)]
*  And we're thinking 16,000 Americans still on the ground in Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=199.06s)]
*  Can we team just scroll all the countries that are going in to get their own? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=203.64s)]
*  We saw something similar to this when we vacated and abdicated all of our responsibility for [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  lives on the ground in Afghanistan under this administration. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=213.06s)]
*  When you see this, look at foreign governments mounting rescue efforts to Israel, Nigeria, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=216.58s)]
*  Switzerland. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=222.94000000000003s)]
*  Just look at all those countries. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  And in fact, I could talk for another minute or so and it will continue to scroll. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=225.94s)]
*  What in the world are we doing with our name not on that list? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  I don't need to know every detail of how they're going to do it. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=233.86s)]
*  We have the best special forces in the world. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=236.5s)]
*  I know how they're going to do it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=238.66000000000003s)]
*  What I want to know is where are we on the scroll? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=240.38000000000002s)]
*  It's remarkable, Harris, the absence of the United States, not only getting our own folks [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=245.7s)]
*  home, but we've always been the one with the assets, the resources. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=249.78s)]
*  You're right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=252.54s)]
*  The best special operators on the face of the planet. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=253.54s)]
*  We've always been the one that helped other nations get their injured, their sick, their [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  people back to their country as well. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=259.34s)]
*  Look, this administration has underreacted to the moment. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=261.53999999999996s)]
*  I'm glad they're providing armaments to Israel. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  That's fantastic. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=266.86s)]
*  I credit them for that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=267.86s)]
*  But where were they on October 7th? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=268.94s)]
*  Where were they in October of last year? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=271.62s)]
*  They didn't invite Prime Minister Netanyahu to the White House. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=275.06s)]
*  These are all symptomatic. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=277.9s)]
*  This is symptomatic of a failed relationship with our partner and ally in the region. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=279.97999999999996s)]
*  And make no mistake, the whole world's watching this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=284.38s)]
*  The Gulf Arab states could see we weren't partnering with Israel as closely as we did [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=286.82s)]
*  in the Trump administration, and so they began to hedge their bets. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=290.85999999999996s)]
*  And what has happened today is the result of Iranian activity. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=293.85999999999996s)]
*  It is they who should be held accountable. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=297.7s)]
*  But the Biden administration's policies set the conditions and the context against what [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=300.06s)]
*  again, set the context for what's happening today. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=304.62s)]
*  I want us to hear from Americans on the ground, including a former congresswoman from Texas, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=307.7s)]
*  Maya Flores now, about what it's like to be there and want to get home. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=314.54s)]
*  I know the administration and Jackie just reported this to others, some Americans who [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=318.26s)]
*  don't want to come home. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=322.06s)]
*  We heard that in Afghanistan, too. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=323.06s)]
*  But what about the thousands of people who do? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=325.46s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=327.82s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=328.82s)]
*  First time I did it was in 2021, when I conducted the very first successful overland rescue [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=330.82s)]
*  of Americans. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=338.86s)]
*  But here it is the second time doing the Biden administration's work, because they have no [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=340.32s)]
*  plan, they have no strategy to get these Americans out who are trapped in these church groups [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=343.62s)]
*  that have been left behind. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=348.06s)]
*  I hope that them being home now or them actually getting out and to be in a safe space has [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=349.06s)]
*  given them confidence that Americans won't be left behind and that at least those of [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=354.7s)]
*  us who are elected officials will stand up when it's needed. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=358.46s)]
*  And if we have Maya Flores, let's roll it. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=362.26s)]
*  Let's see what she's tweeted or Xed or whatever we're calling it these days. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=367.46s)]
*  I am glad you made it home safe. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=373.21999999999997s)]
*  This was a Twitter feed, an ex feed where she was talking with people who had not made [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=375.34s)]
*  it and were finally getting home from other countries, I might add. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  My family is currently abroad in Israel and was also told that there are no plans in place [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=384.92s)]
*  to evacuate United States citizens. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=389.56s)]
*  So with fresh reporting today from Jackie, they're taking a look at the issue. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=392.26s)]
*  Those families should be told before anybody, we are coming to get you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  This is pretty straightforward. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=405.5s)]
*  I remember when we had tens of thousands of people stranded around the world during COVID, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=406.92s)]
*  we moved heaven and earth to get them home. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=413.48s)]
*  We did that every time and always in this administration always underplays it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=415.12s)]
*  They always underreact. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=418.36s)]
*  They always that they're part of us an understanding that is just about the absence of leadership [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=419.58000000000004s)]
*  and protecting the American people and our sovereignty. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=425.06s)]
*  You know, here's we've now got a land war in Europe, a land war in the Middle East. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=427.36s)]
*  We've got thousands of people streaming across our southern border every day. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=433.20000000000005s)]
*  The United States is more at risk today than it has been in an awfully long time. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=437.92s)]
*  In each case, it's a set of policies that deliver these outcomes. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=441.64s)]
*  It did not have to be. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=444.96s)]
*  We have agency here. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=446.88s)]
*  We could have done so much better. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=447.96s)]
*  When I watch the horrific images come out of the Middle East, these babies that were [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=450.12s)]
*  killed, these grandmothers that were taken hostage, the United States needs to stay the [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=454.16s)]
*  course. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=459.76s)]
*  It is going to be difficult in these coming weeks to watch what's happening both in Israel [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=460.76s)]
*  and the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=463.68s)]
*  But we all need to remember October 7th for a long time. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=465.28s)]
*  We need to make sure that we not only wipe Hamas off the face of the earth, but we respond [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=467.96s)]
*  for the to the primary actor, the Iranian regime that you shouldn't forget held hostages [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=472.91999999999996s)]
*  in 1979 for a bunch of days. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=477.64s)]
*  And in the end, it took Ronald Reagan to get them home. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=481.52s)]
*  We need that kind of leadership to make sure we get our Americans out of Israel, our Americans [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=483.52s)]
*  that are held hostage back to freedom. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=487.56s)]
*  And we once again build out a stable and peaceful and prosperous Middle East. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=489.74s)]
*  Look, and what we showed you previously, it was representative from I can't remember which [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=493.64000000000004s)]
*  state. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=499.92s)]
*  I'm going to ask my team, Corey Mills. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=500.92s)]
*  He was from Florida. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=504.38s)]
*  He was talking about how he has gone in and brought 32 Americans home. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  When you have current sitting lawmakers and of course willing, not just willing to go [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  there, but able to get to 32 people and you know you have at least 17 and he's not special [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  forces on the ground with a geared kit. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=521.02s)]
*  It is not only unacceptable. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=524.62s)]
*  It is Afghanistan all over again. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=526.42s)]
*  And remember, we were broken over that. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=529.54s)]
*  We said it wouldn't happen again. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=532.12s)]
*  Under this man's watch, it's happened twice. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=533.96s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken just moments ago, Secretary Pompeo met with survivors and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=536.74s)]
*  victims of families of the Hamas massacre. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=541.9s)]
*  Now remember, he's on the ground today. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=544.34s)]
*  He was at a donation center earlier this morning. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=546.06s)]
*  He's in Tel Aviv. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=549.26s)]
*  Here is part of an emotional exchange with Antony Blinken and families. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=550.5s)]
*  We are survivors from the music raid. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=557.38s)]
*  We were lots of friends. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=560.46s)]
*  Yes, we lost a lot of our friends, close friends, lots of family members. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=563.46s)]
*  There are a lot of people that we know that are kidnapped and now in Gaza. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=572.18s)]
*  We went through horror, really. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=577.14s)]
*  I'm just like, I'm 24 and I never imagined something like this would happen ever in a [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=580.9399999999999s)]
*  dance and a music festival. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=587.3s)]
*  We celebrated love and we danced and it was amazing. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=589.38s)]
*  Then the rocket started and gunshots everywhere. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=594.9s)]
*  We managed to escape, but there were a lot of friends that didn't and there were a lot [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=598.86s)]
*  of friends that are kept captive now in Gaza. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=604.78s)]
*  And we were saved by miracles, but there are friends that we love that we were and that [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=611.4599999999999s)]
*  aren't. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=619.38s)]
*  I know. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=620.38s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=621.38s)]
*  We are with them. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=623.78s)]
*  It's not enough. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=625.22s)]
*  We've got to help them. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=626.22s)]
*  Even when they don't ask, we have to be ready. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=628.02s)]
*  I mean, this is family. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=630.42s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=632.42s)]
*  Harris, I was listening to that and we had both grief and horror and love singing in [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=635.42s)]
*  the background, tough, resilient people in Israel living in their rightful homeland, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=641.42s)]
*  the Jewish people. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=645.5799999999999s)]
*  The United States has a responsibility as an evangelical Christian. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=646.5799999999999s)]
*  I know the importance of Jerusalem and that place. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=650.98s)]
*  They're also great partners and they're wonderful human beings. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=654.14s)]
*  We have a responsibility to help them get this right. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=657.22s)]
*  We'll do our part in the short run. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=660.26s)]
*  I'm confident the Biden administration is now getting that piece right, but this is [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=661.94s)]
*  going to take a sustained effort. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=665.58s)]
*  It's going to take a sustained effort over years. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=667.14s)]
*  This threat is not going away. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=669.66s)]
*  This is the hard work of deterrence. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=671.74s)]
*  And when the Biden administration called the crown prince of Pariah and refused to bring [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=673.5s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu to the United States, those are signals to the bad actors in the [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=677.94s)]
*  world to do precisely the kind of horrors that we have seen over this last week. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=682.26s)]
*  Those are connected. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=686.54s)]
*  We have to get this right. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=687.7s)]
*  We can absolutely do it. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=688.78s)]
*  The American people will support government officials who do. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=689.78s)]
*  And when we get it right, good things will happen all across the world and we'll be more [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=692.42s)]
*  safe. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=695.78s)]
*  I have to let you go, but I have to ask this because you brought up Saudi Arabia and that [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=696.78s)]
*  45 minute phone call that Saudi Arabia had with Iran. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=701.3399999999999s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=705.78s)]
*  That they are united in supporting the Palestinians. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=707.4599999999999s)]
*  And I understand that because they're caught in the gap between fighting forces now and [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=710.5s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=715.5s)]
*  So I, and they can't get out. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=716.5s)]
*  What do you make of 45 minutes? [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=719.34s)]
*  I wonder if our presidents had a conversation about that six billion dollars that's that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=721.22s)]
*  long. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=725.3000000000001s)]
*  I hope so. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=727.34s)]
*  I hope that six billion dollars never sees the light of day. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=728.34s)]
*  I hope no more money goes to the Iranian regime. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=730.38s)]
*  I hope they begin to enforce actual sanctions. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=732.58s)]
*  As for the Gulf states, we've put them in a very difficult position because we negotiated [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=735.34s)]
*  with the Iranians for the first two and a half years of this administration. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=740.14s)]
*  We were cutting deals with them to allow them to have nuclear weapons. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=743.1800000000001s)]
*  If you sit across the Strait of Hormuz or you sit in the region, you say, you know what, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=746.24s)]
*  if the Americans aren't going to help us fight against the regime that wants to kill us too, [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=750.5600000000001s)]
*  I got to figure out a way to hedge. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=755.4s)]
*  Look, I am very confident that the leaders in the Gulf states all want to normalize relationships [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=757.2s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=763.52s)]
*  I'm certain of that. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=764.52s)]
*  The timing, it was always uncertain, but we delivered four of them. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=765.5600000000001s)]
*  They understand Israel is going to exist in this moment. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=769.5600000000001s)]
*  What I'm watching is what they do. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=774.32s)]
*  People see statements. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=776.12s)]
*  They're trying to find their way through this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=777.12s)]
*  What we should look for is the actions that each of these countries take. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=778.72s)]
*  I'm convinced that over time these people that live in the region will see the Jewish [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=781.5600000000001s)]
*  people, the Israelis, they will come to see them as good friends, good partners, good [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=786.5600000000001s)]
*  business colleagues in the same way that the Abraham courts did. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=789.92s)]
*  It will take a little time. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=793.72s)]
*  We can get there, but it's going to take the United States demonstrating its commitment [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=795.36s)]
*  to Israel to help them find their way there. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=798.88s)]
*  God bless you for your optimism and your leadership. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=801.0s)]
*  Thank you, Harris. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=804.48s)]
*  Bless you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=805.52s)]
*  We need that. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=806.52s)]
*  Those songs, the Hebrew songs that they were singing, we know that from every faith. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=807.52s)]
*  We know what a hymnal sounds like as Christians. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=811.04s)]
*  Yes ma'am, we do. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=813.84s)]
*  You and I both do. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=814.84s)]
*  Amen. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=815.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvwMRD5ula4&t=816.84s)]
