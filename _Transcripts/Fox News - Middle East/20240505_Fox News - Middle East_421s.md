# ‘THIS IS NOT A THING’: Dem defends Biden’s plan to welcome Gaza refugees
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs)
*  Are joining me now from the House Democratic congressman Jim Himes ranking member of the House Intel committee congressman great to have you with us [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to start where I did with the senator on what's unfolding in Israel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=6.12s)]
*  I mean Hamas taking credit for a shelling that has caused Israeli casualties [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=9.9s)]
*  Closing an aid crossing was that the whole purpose? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=14.32s)]
*  I mean, it doesn't sound like they are reliable negotiators or you know [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=16.8s)]
*  Good faith partners in any of this trying to get the hostages home [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, of course they're not good faith negotiators they're terrorists [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  Right and and you know, they will do whatever they need to do to advance their own interest now in any negotiation [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=30.04s)]
*  Particularly a negotiation like this, you know people have interests even if they are terrorists and obviously Hamas has an interest [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=36.08s)]
*  In ceasing at least temporarily the obliteration of their military capability [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=42.76s)]
*  So, you know, you never you never sound too optimistic about any negotiation in the Middle East [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  But you know if we can get whatever it is a temporary break in the fighting so that the hostages can be released [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=52.2s)]
*  That's the thing that never gets mentioned here [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=58.2s)]
*  That I think would be a good step in the right direction and Shannon if you'll give me just one minute, you know [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=60.84s)]
*  I work very closely with Marco Rubio. We're both on the gang of eight [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=65.36s)]
*  I don't know that I've ever seen him quite as over caffeinated this morning [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=68.16s)]
*  But he said that you never asked Democrats on the topic of abortion where they should be baloney [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=71.12s)]
*  Malarkey Shannon as you know prior to the Dobbs decision in the Supreme Court Democrats and most of America supported [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=76.60000000000001s)]
*  The concept of Roe v. Wade and the concept was that you could have an abortion up to the point of viability [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=83.22s)]
*  And states could decide you know what that was and so, you know again [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  I'm not quite sure if Marco just had too much coffee this morning [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  But I would say the notion that we're extremists on this topic is just madness [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=95.74s)]
*  But I have asked a number of Democrats because there are multiple states in this country that do allow abortion [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=99.74s)]
*  Until a due date that's factual and I've asked Democrats whether they're okay with that and many of them have had a very hard time [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=105.1s)]
*  Answering that question for me [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=111.76s)]
*  Yeah, but Shannon here's the thing right, you know, the you know, if an abortion occurs [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=114.36s)]
*  Prior to natural birth it doesn't occur because mom says oh I change my mind [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=120.12s)]
*  It occurs because there is the rarest the absolute [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  rarest of medical events that puts the life of the mother in danger or the life of the child in danger, you know to have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=128.2s)]
*  Marco Rubio go on national television and say the Democrats are extremists that believe you should be able to kill a child on the I mean [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=134.72s)]
*  Frankly, that's what's wrong with our politics and you know that and I know that you know again [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=140.66s)]
*  Those situations where a mother has carried a baby to term and something happens in the last week [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=145.06s)]
*  That is the most horrendous of situations [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=150.34s)]
*  And if a doctor says you're going to die if you deliver that that is the most horrendous and you know personal of situations [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  But it's also vanishingly rare and and you know and I know based on what the people of Kansas did and their plebiscite about [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=159.46s)]
*  About abortion that in this country most Americans believe as most Democrats believe that [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=168.14s)]
*  You know, this is a decision up to the point of viability [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=174.22s)]
*  That should be made by a woman and her doctor not by a bunch of guys wearing ties and suits in national legislatures [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=176.74s)]
*  Well, I will say the gutmucker Institute which has been aligned with Planned Parenthood. So clearly not a pro-life organization [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=183.1s)]
*  They document this and say there are actually thousands of late-term abortions third term or third trimester abortions every year [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=188.66s)]
*  And so people do have to have a conversation about the fact that that does happen [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=195.5s)]
*  Yeah, that's right and again most of those late abortions are medically related [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=200.94s)]
*  I mean if if if you're if the idea is that there are women out there who carry a child for seven months and you know [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=205.62s)]
*  Needless to say I have not carried a child [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=213.3s)]
*  But if you've carried a child for seven or eight months and the idea is that lots of women then say oh guess what? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=215.3s)]
*  I don't want to do this. That's just not what happens and okay [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=220.5s)]
*  I don't I haven't actually looked at the gutmucker numbers thousands Shannon as you know, this is a country of some 330 340 million people. So [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=223.82s)]
*  Again, I all I'm all I'm saying is that you know for Marco Rubio to say that nobody ever asks people [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=231.58s)]
*  Democrats in particular where they on abortion nonsense [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=237.62s)]
*  Democrats are generally where the American people are which is where the world was before the Dobbs decision that until the point of viability [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=240.82s)]
*  It this is a decision to be made between a woman and her doctor [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=248.1s)]
*  Well, we'll see because states are now hammering this out there is a patchwork that is very very diverse across this country [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=251.34s)]
*  But let me get back to the Middle East because I want to make sure that we get you on this [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=257.42s)]
*  There are a number of senators who are now worried about the fact that the administration seems to be according to numerous reports [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=260.98s)]
*  The considering the idea of bringing people here from Gaza a number of senators who are worried about [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=266.94s)]
*  The guardrails on that I've written to the president saying this with more than a third of Gazan supporting the Hamas militants [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=272.38s)]
*  We are not confident that your administration can adequately vet this high-risk population [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=278.3s)]
*  For terrorist ties and sympathies before admitting them to the US now this comes on the heels of an inspector general report from DHS [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=283.21999999999997s)]
*  Saying they really blew it repeatedly with Afghan vets. Excuse me vetting Afghan refugees saying this [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=290.62s)]
*  DHS may have admitted or paroled individuals into the US who pose a risk to national security and the safety of local communities [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=296.65999999999997s)]
*  They admit there was a lot of trouble with doing this with the Afghan refugees. Are you [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=303.62s)]
*  Confident you can tell the American people that people coming from Gaza will be appropriately vetted before they take up residence here [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=308.14s)]
*  Well, what I what I can tell you is that this is not a thing, right? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=315.06s)]
*  The only way that people can apply for refugee status is if they go where they are [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=319.16s)]
*  Where they are and begin a very lengthy process of vetting [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=324.14s)]
*  And then once they're vetting and vetted in whatever location and they are they are further vetted by DHS and the federal government and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=328.14s)]
*  others and then they are admitted and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=334.66s)]
*  While you know a number of Republican senators and over caffeinated [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=336.58s)]
*  Florida senators may want to be selling an awful lot of fear right now [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  I would challenge you to to come up with examples where refugees who have been vetted have come to this country and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=343.5s)]
*  Committed acts of terrorism and the reason that's a very hard thing to do is because it hasn't happened, right? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=351.14s)]
*  So now no process is perfect [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=356.9s)]
*  But the point is it's not a thing because there's no capacity in Gaza right now to vet people on the ground and [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=358.79999999999995s)]
*  While we will continue to admit refugees from around the world as is our international legal obligation [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=365.66s)]
*  It is a very strong vetting process now [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=371.38s)]
*  I understand lots of people have an interest in painting Joe Biden is weak and generating a lot of fear [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=374.26000000000005s)]
*  but the reality is it's really really hard to find examples of vetted refugees who have come to this country and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=378.82000000000005s)]
*  Committed an act of terrorism or even a crime [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=384.66s)]
*  No, no [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=386.74s)]
*  I think it is fair to say that we've covered a number of cases where people have come here on paroles and vettings and have [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=387.38s)]
*  Committed crimes now you can quibble on the issue of terrorism [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=392.6s)]
*  But DHS itself says we miss the mark on a lot of Afghan refugees [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=395.2s)]
*  So it's up to them and we wish them the best the administration says no announcement on that yet [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=399.24s)]
*  So we don't even know and have details on a potential program congressmen. We appreciate your time. Thank you [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=403.76s)]
*  Thank you, Shannon. I'm Steve juicy [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ppIWJC1wuGs&t=409.28s)]
