# Kayleigh McEnany: This could be another Afghanistan moment
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0)
*  Kenny McEnany is an outnumbered co-host. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=0.0s)]
*  She is here with me now. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=1.92s)]
*  And at the top of the show, we were talking to Edward Lawrence. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=2.92s)]
*  He was reporting from the White House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=5.4s)]
*  And it is a federal holiday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=6.88s)]
*  But President Biden, and he has nothing on his schedule to come out. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  We do know that John Kirby, the national security spokesperson, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=12.36s)]
*  will be on Martha's show at 3 p.m. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=15.32s)]
*  But is it untenable to think that Biden could be silent again today? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=17.92s)]
*  It is untenable, especially as we're learning American hostages likely in the scenario, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=22.76s)]
*  nine Americans killed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=27.44s)]
*  We need to hear from the president. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=28.919999999999998s)]
*  We didn't hear from him until late afternoon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=29.96s)]
*  The attack happened at 6 30 a.m. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=32.0s)]
*  But when Americans are involved, when Americans have been killed, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=34.24s)]
*  to hear from the commander in chief and saying no uncertain terms, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=37.36s)]
*  I'm going to reiterate my support for Israel. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=41.16s)]
*  And I am going to say you must not harm an American hostage. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=43.8s)]
*  I want to hear from him or from the administration. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=47.32s)]
*  Have you sent FBI special forces, as Robert O'Brien suggested you do? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=49.56s)]
*  Have you sent the special forces hostage team over to the region? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=53.4s)]
*  We don't know the answer to that question. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=58.12s)]
*  I would imagine at the very least, I imagine that you'll see a photo released today [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  of the president in the situation room or on the phone with somebody doing something like that. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  So I just want to show this call for number one. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=67.64s)]
*  What Peter Ducey was describing are these crises around the world, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=70.64s)]
*  and every president has them. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=73.4s)]
*  This is not new, but this is like an urgent crisis. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=74.8s)]
*  But he's got a lot of things going on. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=78.32s)]
*  Afghanistan, of course, Iran, China. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=79.92s)]
*  There's problems in Ethiopia and other places in Africa, Ukraine and now Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=83.03999999999999s)]
*  So that's a lot on his plate. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=87.64s)]
*  And this from the Fox News poll saying that 58 percent of those polled [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=88.88s)]
*  disapprove of the president on foreign policy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=94.52s)]
*  Now, a lot of elections are never necessarily hinge on foreign policy. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=96.72s)]
*  But how do you think that this plays into the overall question about Republicans [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=102.0s)]
*  and Democrats going into 2024? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=106.2s)]
*  Well, if there are American hostages at play, this could be another Afghanistan moment. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=107.88s)]
*  And you're exactly right. Typically, the economy frames approval ratings. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=111.92s)]
*  But as Axios has said, it is impossible to deny the blunder of Afghanistan, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  the fall of Afghanistan and how it affected polling. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  He was at 49 percent in August of 2021. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=123.04s)]
*  One month later, he was at 43 percent. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=125.64s)]
*  Now he's in the 30s. People saw chaos. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=127.6s)]
*  And this adds to the general feeling of chaos. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=130.2s)]
*  You see chaos on the southern border. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=131.8s)]
*  People aren't liking how they're feeling economically. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=133.32s)]
*  And then you look overseas and you see Ukraine, you see China playing these war [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=135.44s)]
*  games, essentially in the South China Sea. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=139.08s)]
*  And China is watching this. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=140.68s)]
*  Taiwan is probably looking more tempting today than it did at 6 a.m. on Saturday. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=142.48s)]
*  And we know that Russia is paying attention as well. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=147.11999999999998s)]
*  The other thing is, is that the candidates now on the Republican side, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  they have an opportunity then to talk about foreign policy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  Some of them don't have specific foreign policy experience. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=155.83999999999997s)]
*  But as we were at the debate, we asked the question, the farther you get from [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=159.56s)]
*  September 11th, the closer you are to September 10th. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=163.56s)]
*  Here's Ron DeSantis in Iowa on Sunday. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=166.2s)]
*  And he was talking about this issue watch. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=169.88s)]
*  If I can tell you this, I wouldn't have slept through those attacks if I were in [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=173.36s)]
*  the White House. I'd have been up at two in the morning and we would have been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=177.88s)]
*  doing what we need to do to protect this country. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=181.2s)]
*  Now, the White House is not going to like that because in a moment of crisis, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=185.0s)]
*  if you have Americans held hostage, you want to make sure that everybody is [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=188.68s)]
*  rallying around the president. But we are in a competitive situation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=191.88s)]
*  So how does a candidate deal with that? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=195.44s)]
*  Look, the best position candidates to deal with this are Ambassador Haley, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=197.36s)]
*  who has a foreign policy record and former President Trump. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=200.4s)]
*  Look, I was there with Ambassador Robert O'Brien, with John Radcliffe, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=203.12s)]
*  with President Trump on September 20, 20 of 2020, when we were celebrating [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  peace accords between Bahrain, United Arab Emirates, Israel. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=212.64000000000001s)]
*  First time has happened since 1994. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=216.88000000000002s)]
*  That's September of 2020. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=218.84s)]
*  Former President Trump should be out there saying often September of 2023 [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=220.24s)]
*  looks a whole lot different. We're not celebrating peace. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  We are looking at war in Israel, something that didn't happen on my watch. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=227.07999999999998s)]
*  So Ambassador Haley, President Trump uniquely positioned on this issue. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  When you see something like this and you think back to the crises that you had [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=233.72s)]
*  to deal with as press secretary, and of course, I had some as well, to me, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  this is on a scope and scale that it feels very overwhelming, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  especially because of the Iranian connection. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=243.72s)]
*  And the White House is going to push back a lot on this particular issue [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=246.16s)]
*  of the six billion dollars. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=250.2s)]
*  But in almost in a way, it feels like they're protesting too much [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=252.0s)]
*  and making too much of a deal of it in terms of making it more so [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=254.48s)]
*  that people are going to keep talking about it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=258.48s)]
*  Yes. Andrew Bates was on Twitter. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=260.24s)]
*  He's in the press shop with essentially a fact check. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  They've all been out there on this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=264.52s)]
*  But the question they're bringing the six billion to light. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=265.84s)]
*  Yes, we're talking about it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  And then there's the 60 billion, as John Radcliffe told me yesterday, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=269.52s)]
*  60 billion in unenforced sanctions that have freed up Iran to sell oil. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=272.2s)]
*  If I'm President Biden, I'm not only in front of a camera today, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=277.52s)]
*  I'm announcing new sanctions on Iran. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=279.84s)]
*  I am there talking tough and saying you enable this in no uncertain terms. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=282.16s)]
*  And we haven't heard that from him yet. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=286.4s)]
*  I know he's being cautious. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=287.44s)]
*  You have to make sure the intelligence is there. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=288.36s)]
*  Everyone I have asked said Iran is behind this. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=290.12s)]
*  Of course, we have the Wall Street Journal report. Indeed. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=292.2s)]
*  OK, yes, I know. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=294.2s)]
*  And what I thought was interesting is that the reporters had more information [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=295.12s)]
*  in 24 hours than apparently the intelligence on all sides [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=297.52s)]
*  had in the months leading up to this. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=300.92s)]
*  Kayleigh, we'll see you on Outnumber then. Yes. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=302.68s)]
*  OK, great. Thank you so much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=monU7vJFZF0&t=304.2s)]
