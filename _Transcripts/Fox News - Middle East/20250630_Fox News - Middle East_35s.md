# John Cusack makes SHOCKING comment on Iran #foxnews #shorts #iran #news #middleeast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g)
*  While our president is working on the Abraham Accords, the actor, John Cusack, said this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=0.0s)]
*  on X, Iran will surely rush to get a nuclear weapon and they should get one. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=5.8s)]
*  It's the only way to deter U.S. and Israel from bombing every country in the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=11.4s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=16.12s)]
*  Are you kidding me? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=17.12s)]
*  I mean, this is great. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=18.12s)]
*  I mean, I think Iran is hiring press agents. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=19.12s)]
*  Yeah, you'd be one of them. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=21.96s)]
*  But that just shows you the anti-American propaganda. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=23.68s)]
*  There's a segment of our population that are buying it, that agree with it. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-sUBsgo92g&t=27.24s)]
