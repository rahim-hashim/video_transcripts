# U.S. troops attacked 14 times in one week
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A)
*  Fox News Lord right now we start at the White House. President Biden is expected to formally [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=0.0s)]
*  take questions today in a news conference for the first time since Hamas' brutal attack [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=4.58s)]
*  on Israel nearly three weeks ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=8.86s)]
*  So it comes as the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, confirms at least 33 Americans were [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  killed by the terrorist group. Ten Americans are still missing answers. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=17.42s)]
*  Here at home, families of American hostages still being held captive in Gaza are lobbying [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  on Capitol Hill today, demanding that lawmakers do more to bring their loved ones home. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=25.5s)]
*  And we just spoke to some of them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=30.54s)]
*  And speaking of Capitol Hill, I am in Washington this morning as the sun comes up. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=32.5s)]
*  The big news, Louisiana Congressman Mike Johnson has emerged as the new frontrunner in the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=37.52s)]
*  race for House Speaker. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=42.6s)]
*  We could see a vote starting at noon today in that building behind us. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=44.64s)]
*  Meanwhile, we have live team coverage. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Mark Meredith is down the street from me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=52.88s)]
*  He's at the White House. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=54.8s)]
*  Harris Trey Yankst is on the ground in southern Israel with the very latest. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=55.8s)]
*  Trey? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=60.14s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=63.14s)]
*  The Israelis continue their strikes against the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=64.14s)]
*  I do want to tell you a little bit about last night as we were along the border watching [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  these flashes of light, both tank fire and airstrikes into Hamas and Islamic Jihad positions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=70.67999999999999s)]
*  We could see Israeli authorities and soldiers near the border. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=76.34s)]
*  There was there was some level of commotion, small arms back and forth and flares being [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=81.12s)]
*  fired into the air. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  We've learned today that two Hamas militants tried to infiltrate through the Zakeem Beach [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=86.36s)]
*  area into southern Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=90.74000000000001s)]
*  So it gives you a sense 19 days into this conflict. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=93.06s)]
*  This is still both a ground and air conflict. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=96.02000000000001s)]
*  Just last hour, Hamas fired a long range rocket north of the city of Haifa. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=99.02000000000001s)]
*  This sits in the northern part of Israel, so they're still able to maintain their ability [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=104.34s)]
*  to fire rockets toward major population centers despite the thousands of airstrikes that are [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=108.44s)]
*  taking place along the Gaza Strip and the continued attempts for infiltration. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=113.42s)]
*  I do want to draw your attention to the north, though, along the border with Lebanon, more [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=117.78s)]
*  anti-tank guided missile attacks into Israeli territory. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=121.78s)]
*  The Israelis striking more Hezbollah positions, both command centers and launch points, trying [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=125.58s)]
*  to hit as many of those cells as possible. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=130.06s)]
*  And then overnight in the West Bank, the Israelis say that they struck a group of militants [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=132.51999999999998s)]
*  in the refugee camp of Jenin, killing three of them that were throwing explosive devices [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=136.62s)]
*  at Israeli soldiers. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=141.72s)]
*  So we really are looking at a three front situation here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=142.96s)]
*  The Israelis bracing for what could come next and the entire country uncertain about when [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=145.82000000000002s)]
*  that ground invasion into the strip will be decided. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=150.62s)]
*  Guys back to you. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=154.0s)]
*  Hey, Trey, is there a sense that the Prime Minister Netanyahu has to get the go ahead [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=155.0s)]
*  from President Biden to do anything? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  Because I hear that his right is very frustrated. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=163.38s)]
*  They can't figure out why they're waiting. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  Can you get a sense of the politics there? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=168.58s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=172.26s)]
*  We could talk about the politics of the Americans and also the other regional players in all [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=173.26s)]
*  of this. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=178.34s)]
*  According to reports, the United States is urging the Israelis to not immediately enter [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=179.34s)]
*  Gaza and move forward with this ground operation, despite the staging here in southern Israel [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=184.26s)]
*  of thousands of infantry troops, tanks and APCs that are ready to take the battle to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=188.76s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=193.18s)]
*  This is for two reasons. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=194.18s)]
*  One has to do with the hostages that haven't yet been freed. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=195.54s)]
*  The other has to do with the plan for the future and who will take care of Gaza once [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=199.6s)]
*  Hamas is destroyed. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  And that's a real concern because you have more than two million civilians and the death [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  toll in Gaza is rapidly rising. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=211.88s)]
*  More than 5700 people have been killed, according to local authorities. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=214.2s)]
*  I do want to read you, though, just a statement we received this morning by Israel's national [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=217.56s)]
*  security adviser that gives us some insight on what's taking place. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=222.0s)]
*  He says, I'm pleased to say that Qatar is becoming an essential party and stakeholder [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=226.18s)]
*  in the facilitation of humanitarian solutions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=231.34s)]
*  Qatar's diplomatic efforts are crucial at this time. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=233.9s)]
*  So clearly the Qataris are working behind the scenes, trying to ferry messages between [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=237.1s)]
*  the Israelis and Hamas and get as many of those civilians that are being held inside [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=240.98s)]
*  Gaza to safety. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=244.85999999999999s)]
*  Trey, the people you talk to that serve the country and the IDF, what are they saying? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=246.26s)]
*  Do they want to go in? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  They do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=252.96s)]
*  The vast majority of soldiers that I've been texting with and staying in touch with along [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=254.96s)]
*  the border say they're ready to take the battle to Hamas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=258.76s)]
*  They saw the massacre that took place on October 7th. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=261.72s)]
*  They understand the trauma that Israel has faced on what's being called the country's [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=264.6s)]
*  darkest day. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  And so they're ready to not just degrade the capabilities of this organization in the strip, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  but completely eradicate Hamas from the map. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=275.92s)]
*  They want to get rid of the group that caused the pain and the suffering of their people. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=278.29999999999995s)]
*  And so they're ready. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=285.17999999999995s)]
*  They're ready to go and they're waiting for those orders. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=286.17999999999995s)]
*  And that's part of the calculation the Israeli political echelon has to make in all of this, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  understanding that each and every day that goes by, you have soldiers that have this [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=293.21999999999997s)]
*  adrenaline here in the South. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=296.73999999999995s)]
*  They're ready to go. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=298.02s)]
*  And some of that will die down as the days pass. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=299.46s)]
*  You know, Trey, I'm just curious. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=302.58s)]
*  Obviously these folks are still healing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=305.02s)]
*  They're preparing for war. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  But there's protests happening all across the country, all across the world, in fact, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=309.76s)]
*  of people that don't support them. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=314.92s)]
*  And I'm just curious, do they feel the support there on the ground or do they see what's [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=317.32s)]
*  happening all across the world where there's a lot of folks that are supporting Hamas? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=323.2s)]
*  They absolutely see the support. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=330.59999999999997s)]
*  We were just at a hospital, and we'll bring you that story later, about newborns amid [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=332.18s)]
*  the war who are being delivered in a reinforced maternity ward. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=336.62s)]
*  We actually held a one hour old baby, just a bright moment amid this really dark story. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=341.26000000000005s)]
*  But they see the support. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=346.82000000000005s)]
*  And one man actually said, tell the people in New Jersey, his family was from New Jersey, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=348.46000000000004s)]
*  we see the support and thank you for sending sending all this love and actual goods to [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=352.82000000000005s)]
*  the soldiers on the front lines. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=357.34000000000003s)]
*  But they also see the protests that are taking place across the world. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=359.26000000000005s)]
*  And remember, this is probably the most complex story on Earth to cover. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=362.02000000000004s)]
*  Because people see the images from inside Gaza. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=366.62s)]
*  Save the Children says more than 2000 people under 18 have been killed since this war [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=368.98s)]
*  erupted inside the strip. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=373.02000000000004s)]
*  And many of those are innocent civilians that are caught amid the crossfire. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=374.98s)]
*  So it's an incredibly emotional and complex story to cover. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=377.90000000000003s)]
*  And the Israelis understand that they've been dealing with this for years. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=381.46000000000004s)]
*  The communities here along the border have lived under rocket fire. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=384.66s)]
*  They've raised their children in bomb shelters in many cases. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=387.26000000000005s)]
*  And so they understand what's taking place, not just here on the ground, but the reaction [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=390.70000000000005s)]
*  from around the world. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=394.5s)]
*  That's sad, Steve. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=395.8s)]
*  Indeed. Trey, thank you very much for the live report from southern portions of Israel. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=398.36s)]
*  All right. Meanwhile, also in the Mideast, Iranian backed militias are mounting new [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=403.72s)]

*  Wow. Mark Meredith is live at the White House with more. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=412.4s)]
*  Is there a response yet, Mark, from the White House? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=415.52s)]
*  Lawrence, there is. Good morning to all of you and Steve. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=419.6s)]
*  Welcome back here to Washington. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=421.96s)]
*  U.S. officials say they are closely watching these developments, these recent attacks, both [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=423.53999999999996s)]
*  rocket and drone attacks on U.S. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=427.62s)]
*  forces serving in the Middle East, calling them not only troubling but of growing concern. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=429.34s)]
*  And while these attacks are being carried out by third party groups, they believe the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=433.9s)]
*  Iranians have their fingerprints all over them. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=438.14s)]
*  We've been learning about these attacks and more details, including just last night as the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=440.78s)]
*  Pentagon released new details with at least 24 service members injured over the last few [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=444.53999999999996s)]
*  days in these attacks taking place both in Iraq and in Syria. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=449.38s)]
*  While new U.S. troops have been killed, at least one American contractor died after [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=452.66s)]
*  suffering a cardiac incident, basically panicked after these drone attacks were being launched [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=456.86s)]
*  at the base they were at. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=461.56s)]
*  Now the U.S. is warning Iran directly and the militias involved to tread carefully. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=462.8s)]
*  The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=468.16s)]
*  We do not want this war to widen. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=471.8s)]
*  But if Iran or its proxies attack U.S. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=474.48s)]
*  personnel anywhere. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=478.24s)]
*  Make no mistake, we will defend our people. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=480.52000000000004s)]
*  We will defend our security swiftly and decisively. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=484.24s)]
*  Today, we expect President Biden to offer his latest reaction to the developments in the [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=489.14000000000004s)]
*  Middle East. He's welcoming the prime minister of Australia here to the White House. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=493.04s)]
*  There will be a news conference in the noon hour on Tuesday. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=496.46000000000004s)]
*  The president spoke with Saudi Arabia's crown prince to talk about efforts to keep this [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  conflict from growing any larger, from widening any more than it already has. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=503.54s)]
*  Back here in Washington, more drama overnight up on Capitol Hill. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=507.38000000000005s)]
*  House Republicans have selected another speaker, doesn't it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=510.90000000000003s)]
*  But it's unclear if he's going to have the votes to win the gavel officially. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=514.0600000000001s)]
*  Mike Johnson of Louisiana won the most votes overnight after multiple rounds of balloting. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=517.5s)]
*  He is 51 years old. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=522.5400000000001s)]
*  He served in the House since 2017. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=524.22s)]
*  He's the former chair of the Republican Study Committee. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=526.34s)]
*  And while I said there's no guarantee that he's going to get the gavel, he does appear to [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=528.82s)]
*  be a little bit closer than some of those candidates who've come before him. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=531.98s)]
*  We'll look to see what happens on the House floor a little bit later on today. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=534.9599999999999s)]
*  Meantime, this photo just coming into our newsroom, coming from the governor of California [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=538.24s)]
*  as he shakes hands with the president of China, President Xi Jinping. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=542.64s)]
*  This was a meeting that took place today in Beijing. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=545.88s)]
*  Governor Newsom is on a weeklong tour of China. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=548.6s)]
*  He was in Hong Kong on Monday. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  And it's interesting in this conversation with President Xi, we're told that the governor [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=553.12s)]
*  talked about climate change efforts to develop more economic relationship between California [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=556.52s)]
*  and China. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=561.5799999999999s)]
*  But some Republicans have slammed Newsom's visit as delusional given the ongoing state [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=562.5799999999999s)]
*  of affairs between the U.S. and China. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=567.2199999999999s)]
*  Steve, Ainsley, Brian and Lawrence, back to you guys. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=569.3399999999999s)]
*  Right, and how bad California is doing. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=571.3399999999999s)]
*  He feels like he wants to talk solar panels with the Chinese president. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=574.18s)]
*  Thanks, Mark. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=577.38s)]
*  Looking very presidential, right? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=578.38s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=579.38s)]
*  Well, he looks good. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=580.38s)]
*  He's a handsome man. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=581.38s)]
*  But in terms of the reverse side of his baseball card is the issue. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=582.38s)]
*  I would just bring up one thing. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=585.5s)]
*  It is so maddening that we are not hitting back at the Iranian-sponsored militias that [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=587.06s)]
*  are lining up our guys. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=593.2399999999999s)]
*  They're not telling us when these attacks take place. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=594.68s)]
*  We find out about it days later. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=597.0799999999999s)]
*  We have all those weapons and assets in the area, and we're not allowing it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=599.16s)]
*  Knocking a drone out of the sky that's about to kill you is not being on the front foot. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=603.2399999999999s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=608.2399999999999s)]
*  It's so crazy, because I remember back in 2018, you got in Syria, you got the Wagner [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=609.2399999999999s)]
*  group that are striking a JSOC post. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=616.4s)]
*  Mattis gets on the phone, calls his counterpart. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=619.24s)]
*  He says, are you guys striking us? [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=621.16s)]
*  And of course, his Russian counterpart says, no, we're not doing it. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=622.66s)]
*  Okay. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=625.4599999999999s)]
*  Mattis gets back on. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=626.4599999999999s)]
*  He calls Dunford. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=627.4599999999999s)]
*  He goes, you know what? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=628.4599999999999s)]
*  Annihilate them. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=629.4599999999999s)]
*  And they took out 250 to 300 forces in the Wagner group. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=630.4599999999999s)]
*  That is a response to something. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=633.92s)]
*  It seems like, Ainsley, the position of the White House is just posture. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=635.36s)]
*  We don't want to fight. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=639.06s)]
*  We don't want to fight. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=640.3s)]
*  They're attacking us, and we're saying we don't want to fight. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=641.52s)]
*  We give you $900 billion to defend America and the free world, and you sit there in a [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=643.86s)]
*  crouch, in the fetal position. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=648.66s)]
*  Well, yesterday, Jackie Heinrich was talking with John Kirby, and she said, you know, you've [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=650.26s)]
*  said in the past Iran wasn't involved in all of this in Israel. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=654.86s)]
*  He said, that's not what I was saying. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=657.34s)]
*  He said Iran is certainly complicit. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=659.26s)]
*  He said, without them, there is no Hamas. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=661.22s)]
*  Without them, there is no Hezbollah. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=663.6s)]
*  20 were hit, 20 of our men were injured in Syria. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=665.14s)]
*  Four were injured last week in Iraq. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=668.82s)]
*  This is the first we're hearing about this. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=670.64s)]
*  These attacks were U.S. military bases. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=672.66s)]
*  We saw the map of that in the Middle East, and they were conducted by rockets, and they [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=674.5s)]
*  were conducted by drones, Steve. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=678.2199999999999s)]
*  They're not in fear of America. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=680.3s)]
*  No, they're not. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=682.54s)]
*  They are not. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=684.54s)]
*  And one of the other things that Kirby said was that any sort of a ceasefire only helps [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=685.54s)]
*  Hamas at this point. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NwFbo-hSw0A&t=692.42s)]
