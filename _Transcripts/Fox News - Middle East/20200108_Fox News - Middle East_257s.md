# Mike Huckabee: 'Little dog' Iran not worth war
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso)
*  Meanwhile, let's bring in Mike Huckabee Fox, who's contributor, former governor of Arkansas, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=0.0s)]
*  former Republican presidential candidate. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=3.84s)]
*  He joins us right now from down in Florida. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  Governor, we've had a number of military guests on who have said if that, if that 15 or 20 [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=7.84s)]
*  missiles was Iran's response, President Trump wins this round. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  You know, I think people need to look at this sort of in the context of an old fairy tale [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  I grew up with, the three bears. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  There was one bowl of porridge that was too hot, one that was too cold, one that was just [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=27.08s)]
*  right. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=31.159999999999997s)]
*  For a while, the U.S. strategy toward the Middle East, specifically toward Iraq, was [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=32.16s)]
*  too hot. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=36.92s)]
*  We wanted to go in, do nation building, build schools. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=37.92s)]
*  We thought we could create a democracy. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=41.019999999999996s)]
*  So we went all in. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=42.8s)]
*  We put military boots on the ground. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=44.4s)]
*  We thought we were fighting for freedom. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  It turned out that they didn't want it that badly after all. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=48.12s)]
*  Then the Obama administration came. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=51.32s)]
*  Theirs was too cold. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  It was let's appease everybody. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=54.32s)]
*  Let's be half hearted in what we're doing and let's give Iran a bunch of cash and maybe [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  they'll be nicer to us if we buy them off. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=61.68s)]
*  I think this president has taken the right approach. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=64.44s)]
*  It's measured, it's targeted, it's specific. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=66.84s)]
*  The media will never give him credit for the fact that he has been very thoughtful and [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=69.72s)]
*  careful but taking out Soleimani was an important act of getting rid of a monster. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=74.16s)]
*  We ought to be proud of this president for what he's done and the manner in which he's [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=81.82000000000001s)]
*  done it. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=84.62s)]
*  Even if people say this is a win for the president or they're shaking in their boots [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=85.62s)]
*  because it's obvious they targeted, many people are saying they targeted these bases where [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=90.22s)]
*  Americans are but didn't hit anyone. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=95.98s)]
*  There are no casualties and they have the ability to be able to take people out if they [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=97.9s)]
*  want to. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=101.18s)]
*  We still can't forget who we're dealing with, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=102.22s)]
*  We can. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=106.54s)]
*  This is a 40 year regime that has been saying death to Israel, death to America. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=108.06s)]
*  Israel is the little Satan. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=112.30000000000001s)]
*  America is the great Satan. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=113.54s)]
*  They threatened us for 40 years. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=115.5s)]
*  We finally have a president who takes that seriously and doesn't just disregard it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=117.34s)]
*  Let's look at it this way. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=122.42s)]
*  This is a president who is like the big dog. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=123.62s)]
*  He knows Iran is not worth a war. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=125.66s)]
*  They're not. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=128.62s)]
*  They're not that big. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=129.62s)]
*  They're not that important. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=130.62s)]
*  The pressure he's put on them economically is crumbling them from within. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=131.62s)]
*  But the little dog, Iran, keeps barking and sniffing and tries to just harass the big [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=136.08s)]
*  dog. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=141.66s)]
*  But the truth is the big dog isn't taking the bait. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=143.06s)]
*  But one day when the little dog gets out of hand, the big dog will bite back and it's [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=145.96s)]
*  going to be all over. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=150.78s)]
*  So far we've had dogs and bears in your appearance. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=151.78s)]
*  And let's keep it up with that analogy because Lawrence O'Donnell tweeted this while the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=155.38s)]
*  missiles were still in the air. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=159.98000000000002s)]
*  Trump wagged the dog. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=161.46s)]
*  Now the dog is wagging Trump. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=162.78s)]
*  We continue with Joy Reid. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=164.66s)]
*  Good patient diplomacy and strong alliances got us to the brink of peace and in just a [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=166.7s)]
*  few years Trump's impulses have brought us to the edge of war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=170.94s)]
*  And Michael Moore, suddenly a critic of the president, okay he's always been, Trump will [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=174.57999999999998s)]
*  use any form of attack to escalate the war he has started. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=178.02s)]
*  The war is meant as an episode of the Unreality Show, a distraction from impeachment. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  Not a lot of support. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=186.18s)]
*  There won't be any. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=189.02s)]
*  These people couldn't give Donald Trump credit no matter what he did. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=190.3s)]
*  If they were all given an opportunity to sit in the White House Situation Room and watch [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=194.34s)]
*  on Sulimani live they would say the video quality was not good enough. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=200.34s)]
*  So there's never going to be a time when they acknowledge him. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=204.5s)]
*  But I think a lot of people may be recognized that President Trump truly does not want war. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=207.66s)]
*  He is exactly who he presented himself to be as a candidate and as a president. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't want war. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  But he's not going to let Americans just get killed and him look the other way and act [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=221.28s)]
*  like it didn't happen. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=225.18s)]
*  I think we want a president who fights for America but doesn't get us into somebody else's [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=226.22s)]
*  fight. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=231.78s)]
*  He has been totally consistent with that and we ought to be grateful. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=232.78s)]
*  And we know too that if we get out the Russians get in. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=236.98s)]
*  Vladimir Putin on the ground in Syria yesterday taking a bow. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=240.14s)]
*  He restored Assad to power and brought peace to Damascus. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=243.9s)]
*  So we can leave but it doesn't mean other players aren't going in. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=247.78s)]
*  And I'm not sure we're too comfortable with that. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=250.7s)]
*  Governor Huckabee thanks so much. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=253.3s)]
*  Thank you guys. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3zsCvwu6Zso&t=256.0s)]
