# The Biden admin gave Iran ‘the green light’: Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ)
*  For reaction to that, Mike Pompeo, former secretary of state and CIA director, now Fox News contributor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran has a one million dollar bounty on his head and the Biden administration just renewed [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=5.2s)]
*  your security protection, Secretary Pompeo, in January. So obviously all of this hits close to [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=11.36s)]
*  home. What do you make of the word of this imminent strike? Well, Martha, it's great to be with you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  I think what we can see is the risk is pretty significant. It sounds like they have pretty [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=25.2s)]
*  specific intelligence about a relatively imminent attack. They may know more than they've even [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=30.08s)]
*  led on about both timing and the nature of that attack. I haven't seen the intelligence, obviously. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=34.64s)]
*  But, you know, Martha, as a policy matter, what I think this suggests is we just we've lost the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=39.44s)]
*  bubble. We've lost deterrence. The Iranians have already attacked Israel once on October 7th through [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=43.76s)]
*  their proxy Hamas. They're continuing to fire on American interests in the region now over a hundred [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=48.96s)]
*  times since October 7th. And so what we're talking about in the next 24 or 48 hours is just a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=53.76s)]
*  continuation of a failed policy to actually protect Israel. And so when I hear President Biden say [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=60.0s)]
*  he's prepared to defend them, you know, last week he told them they couldn't continue to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=65.2s)]
*  destroy Hamas. And so they've really told the Iranians this is green light, even [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=69.92s)]
*  even his statements today, which says what's your what's your response is? Don't. Well, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=74.8s)]
*  he said don't multiple times and don't isn't a national security policy. It's not even a deterrent. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=79.04s)]
*  This is frankly don't from President Biden suggests don't do anything that would draw us in and then [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  we'll accept it. This is really dangerous stuff, Martha. I mean, my mind goes back to the minor [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  incursion in Ukraine. That was the warning at that time. Right. And I find it very interesting, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=95.68s)]
*  this reporting from Axios that Iran sent a message to President Biden through several Arab [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=103.28s)]
*  countries this week warning if the U.S. gets involved, U.S. forces will be attacked. And they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=108.72s)]
*  they use some colorful language to say basically don't mess with us and we won't mess with you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=116.08s)]
*  And this builds on the White House saying after the Damascus attack, we had nothing to do with [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=121.28s)]
*  that. Right. And the people who were taken out are people who want to take out U.S. forces [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=126.72s)]
*  in the Middle East. We could have said nothing or we could have said something supportive. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  It looks like our posture is very, very, very careful with Iran and what we say and do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=136.64s)]
*  Very careful. And Martha evinces weakness and fearfulness. Your point's exactly right. It does [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=145.6s)]
*  sound like the minor incursion language in Afghanistan and we know how that ended. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=151.44s)]
*  And we shouldn't forget when the Iranians say, well, you stay out of this. We'll leave you out. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=155.92s)]
*  They've not left us out. They fired at Americans. We've had folks killed working in the Red Sea. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=161.04s)]
*  We have Americans held hostage inside of Gaza today. I pray that they're still alive, but those [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=166.4s)]
*  are Americans being held by Iranians. They haven't left us out of this. And you can't leave the United [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=170.56s)]
*  States out when you're attacking our friend and ally in Israel. And so the fact that we've lost [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=175.84s)]
*  this capacity to deter that we let the Iranians even make statements and leak statements like, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=180.24s)]
*  hey, we've told we told the Americans to stay out of this. That that evinces a weakness that [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=184.32s)]
*  is a green light for a regime that has made very clear their intention to destroy the little Satan [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=188.48000000000002s)]
*  in Israel and the great Satan in America. So what's different after the Qasem Soleimani hit, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=193.36s)]
*  there was a pause. Everyone expected a severe retaliation for that hit. It came in the form [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=200.08s)]
*  of a of a missile strike and no Americans were killed, thankfully, but there were Americans who [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=206.88000000000002s)]
*  had some brain injuries as a result of that. Overall, it was seen as as I guess not as forceful [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=212.88000000000002s)]
*  as it could have been. What has changed now and what kind of strike do you expect we're going to [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=221.04s)]
*  see here? Let me take the second one first, Martha. I don't know the nature of the strike. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  It won't surprise me if it's a strike that has some level of ambiguity so that the Iranians [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=231.92s)]
*  won't unite the whole world against them. So think maybe could be a cyber strike, could be a [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=236.88s)]
*  strike through a proxy, could be some mechanism by which the Iranian hand won't be completely seen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=241.28s)]
*  On the other hand, they may just decide to come over the top and launch missiles directly [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=246.64s)]
*  from Iran into an Israeli asset somewhere in the world. Second, you asked what changed. What [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=250.48s)]
*  changed was American leadership. There was no doubt that the United States stood with Israel. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=257.12s)]
*  President Trump didn't have to go out every day and say, hey, where were the Israelis? Where were [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=261.68s)]
*  the Israelis? They could see it in our actions, right? Recognition of the rightful homeland of [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=264.56s)]
*  the Jewish capital, the movement, acknowledging that the Golan Heights were part of Israel. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  All the work that we had done made very clear where America stood. And when you're out having [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=274.48s)]
*  to just reiterate in the time of crisis that you're with an ally, that suggests somehow that in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=279.2s)]
*  the minds of the Gulf Arab states, frankly, probably in the Israeli leadership minds and [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=284.32s)]
*  certainly in the minds of the Ayatollah, mind of the Ayatollah, they are very worried if America [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=288.88s)]
*  will walk away if it's not an American interest that is harmed in this strike. So if Iran is [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=293.36s)]
*  sensing wobbliness, how emboldened are they? Maybe they see this as a moment where they do [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=298.08s)]
*  want to go further than they may have gone in the past. They don't want there to be an Israel. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=304.56s)]
*  This is a very real risk. You know this, Martha, we've talked about this. Getting deterrence back [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=312.88s)]
*  once you've lost it is incredibly difficult and it requires resolve. And you can't at every turn [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=318.64s)]
*  be talking about the fact that you're fearful of escalation. When you begin to talk about, well, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=324.48s)]
*  we're not going to do anything to the Iranians, we're out of this game. They view that as a green [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=328.96s)]
*  light. And so you're right, continued aggression. Think about the fact that we've told Israel, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=332.96s)]
*  hey, you have to be way more careful when in fact we know the Israelis are fighting in a way [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=337.2s)]
*  that is as careful as combat can be conducted. Those are the kinds of things that the perception [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=341.52s)]
*  from the Iranians grows, that they can move about the cabin freely, and the risk to the United [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=346.64s)]
*  States continues to increase as well as with a wide open southern border, who knows who the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=351.12s)]
*  Iranians may have moved inside of our country as well. Just very quickly, and I'm just thinking [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  about our U.S. servicemen and women on the ground in these areas who are always under threat [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=359.52s)]
*  by Iranian proxies. How do you think they read that when they hear the president say, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=364.71999999999997s)]
*  or the White House convey, you know, we don't have anything to do with this. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=369.44s)]
*  We're not in the middle of this. We're backing off essentially. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=373.68s)]
*  You know, if it were one of my family members or someone that I loved and I heard a president say, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=378.56s)]
*  we're not in this, but I knew my son or my daughter was actually in it, stationed somewhere [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=383.84s)]
*  in the Middle East or on a ship out in one of the seas, I would be both troubled and concerned [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=388.56s)]
*  that the commander-in-chief wasn't doing everything he needed to do to deter the Iranians from coming [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=394.24s)]
*  after my son, my daughter, my cousin, my brother, my family member. It's a real risk, Martha, that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=398.88s)]
*  I think every service member can see, and I'm happy that General Kurila is on the ground in [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=403.92s)]
*  Israel coordinating with the Israelis. I think that's a good thing for the Biden administration [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=408.96s)]
*  to have done, but man, I fear it may just be way too late, and that weakness has already been [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=412.72s)]
*  demonstrated. Let's hope not. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Fox News contributor, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=417.12s)]
*  always good to see you, sir. Thank you very much for joining me today. Yes, ma'am. Thank you, Martha. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOGxWgMWuDQ&t=422.32s)]
