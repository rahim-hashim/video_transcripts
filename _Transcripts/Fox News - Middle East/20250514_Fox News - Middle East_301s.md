# Trump envoy gives emotional gift to hostage released by Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc)
*  Home sweet home. Eden Alexander's toasting to his freedom in his first social media post [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=0.0s)]
*  after spending 600 plus days in Hamas captivity. You can see him wearing the Star of David [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  necklace there. We've learned it was gifted to him by special envoy Steve Woodcoff. It [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=11.86s)]
*  belonged to Woodcoff's late son, Andrew, and he reportedly told Eden, you would be doing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=16.5s)]
*  a great honor to my son if you keep wearing it. Meanwhile, Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  Doran Spielman joins us right now. Great to see you, sir. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=26.54s)]
*  Nice to see you too, Brian. First off, your thought about the release. I mean, it was [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=29.76s)]
*  pretty dynamic. It's almost as if Israel wasn't really involved in this that much, right? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=32.88s)]
*  Look, him coming home, like Steve Woodcoff said he's one of their children, every Israeli [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=37.68s)]
*  looks at Eden Alexander as if their own son was brought home. This is so emotional. And [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  to see that gift that Woodcoff gave him shows, I think, the understanding of the United States [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=47.08s)]
*  and the American people. He understood the suffering. His son wore that necklace and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=51.96s)]
*  And he gave it to Eden Alexander to say, I know what you've been through. I know that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=56.84s)]
*  you were in those dungeons underneath Hamas. You're going to make it through this because [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=61.2s)]
*  he's going to need that necklace, not for today, for the next five years. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=65.88000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, they have to kind of put a time limit on it. If we don't get the rest of the hostages [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=69.12s)]
*  out, they'll believe 23 is still alive. We're going to start taking Gaza, more and more [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  land every single day. Where is that at now? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=76.04s)]
*  That's the only reason this deal came through. I know that the administration is saying that [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=79.4s)]
*  they're afraid of Trump. They're not afraid of Trump. Hamas is not afraid of Trump. They're [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=82.56s)]
*  afraid of Trump giving the green light to Israel to take over the Gaza Strip because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=85.8s)]
*  Hamas cares about two things, killing Israelis and surviving. The only thing that's going [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  to stop that is if Israel pushes them to the end. It's the only way, Brian, we're going [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=94.56s)]
*  to get those hostages home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=98.56s)]
*  How do you feel about Israel's role in this trip? It's really about the Gulf States. Some [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=99.56s)]
*  say Israel feels kind of left out. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=103.24s)]
*  I think we are left out. I think the fact that the president's not visiting us, we have [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=106.12s)]
*  to understand the U.S. and Israel, we're not just allies. We actually share common values. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=109.84s)]
*  What I wrote about in my book, we share the foundations of the Bible. These countries [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=113.72s)]
*  that are coming and going, they're opportunistic. In fact, Qatar, where the president is right [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=117.82s)]
*  now, they house Hamas' leaders and they teach an ideology that says that there was no Bible [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=122.76s)]
*  in Jerusalem. Muhammad was the first person in Jerusalem. I face this every day in the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  city of David, attacks by Qatar, by Hamas. And so the very foundational values of the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=131.24s)]
*  United States are rejected by Qatar. We have to be extremely careful with what we're doing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=136.32s)]
*  here. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=141.07999999999998s)]
*  So, we're going to start with the untold story of the rediscovery, the ancient city [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=142.08s)]
*  of David in Jerusalem. Where do you go to get your new news? And where do you go, archaeologically? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=144.28s)]
*  And what do you discover? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=151.28s)]
*  I go seven stories underneath the ground. In Jerusalem, we're outside the walls of the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=153.96s)]
*  old city. We found the actual city. We dig deep beneath the ground, down to the bedrock [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=157.88000000000002s)]
*  of Mount Moriah, which is the actual mountain Abraham used to bound Isaac. And that's where [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=162.68s)]
*  we uncovered right now the pilgrimage road. It's unbelievable. The place where Jews, non-Jews, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=166.98000000000002s)]
*  early Christianity, they walked up to the Temple Mount. And there, Brian, we found actual [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=172.34s)]
*  coins that say on them, for the freedom of Zion. And the problem is, for Qatar and for [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  Hamas, those coins that said for the freedom of Zion were minted 600 years before Muhammad. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=182.22s)]
*  So how can you be teaching a whole generation of Palestinians, of Hamas, people on campuses [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=187.70000000000002s)]
*  in the United States, that Jews are colonialists in their land when we have proof that they're [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=192.92s)]
*  not? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. And people don't want to hear that. But they do want to read your book. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=197.32s)]
*  And here's an excerpt from it. And I'll read it if it's okay. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=200.72s)]
*  On October 8th, this is your reflection in the aftermath. The day after the Amass massacre, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=203.72s)]
*  I was in military uniform, standing on the southern border with Gaza, on an empty highway [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  near the Israeli city of Sturdot. Silence hung heavily in the air. The road was a graveyard [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=211.92s)]
*  of hundreds of abandoned vehicles overturned, smashed in light poles, burned out metal frames, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=217.88s)]
*  left as the grim remnants of chaos. The ground was littered with what remained of disrupted [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=222.44s)]
*  lives. Backpacks, baby bottles, scattered belongings left behind in panic. I stood by [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=227.04s)]
*  one of the wrecked cars with a fellow soldier who had driven south with me. The weight of [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=231.76s)]
*  what had happened pressed down on me. Hearing those remarks, you put them down in black [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=235.8s)]
*  and white. What should people know about that day? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  You have to know, if somebody comes to erase your history, like Hamas came to erase Israel, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=242.52s)]
*  if they deny the Holocaust, if they deny the foundations of the Bible, the next thing you're [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=247.56s)]
*  going to do is to try to erase you. As I stood on that street, I realized I had already [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=252.24s)]
*  started writing the book. Why didn't I wake up? Why didn't I realize where this would [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=256.92s)]
*  lead? We should have known. The United States, what's happening on campuses here and in hallways [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=260.72s)]
*  and in Israel, we are facing an existential threat to our identity, Brian. And if we don't [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=265.2s)]
*  stand up now, and that's what I did in this book, it's a roadmap back to the truth of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=271.0s)]
*  our foundations that are grounded in the archaeology in Jerusalem. If we stand up for that, then [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=276.24s)]
*  we can ultimately win. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=280.24s)]
*  And if we win this, don't speak his name of it. By the way, we are winning. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=281.24s)]
*  Thank God. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=283.72s)]
*  And there's a huge pushback everywhere. Thanks so much. Congratulations. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=284.72s)]
*  Thank you very much, Brian. Great to see you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=287.44s)]
*  Meanwhile, keep fighting. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wMfI6ScyVqc&t=289.24s)]
