# Israel releases footage of the arrival of U.S. weaponry
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU)
*  Chief National Security Correspondent Jennifer Griffin is live for us at the Pentagon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=0.0s)]
*  Jen, that sounds like a lot on its way. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=5.62s)]
*  What else can you tell us? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=8.82s)]
*  Well, Harris, first of all, U.S. intelligence officials are still saying they do not have [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=10.06s)]
*  any concrete evidence linking Iran to the Hamas terror attack. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=14.66s)]
*  They obviously are looking very closely. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=19.86s)]
*  There's obviously been a great intelligence vacuum in recent days in the lead-up to this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=22.82s)]
*  But U.S. intelligence officials still say they cannot concretely link Iran to this attack. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=28.98s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told reporters on his way to the NATO Defense Ministerial [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=34.62s)]
*  in Brussels that he offered U.S. personnel to help rescue Israeli and American hostages [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=39.06s)]
*  and added the Defense Department has the ability to rapidly deploy other resources into the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=44.58s)]
*  region if necessary. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=50.22s)]
*  When I spoke to Minister Galan on Sunday, I offered our assistance, our special operators, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=52.22s)]
*  the help of our special operators, our intelligence community in planning and developing intelligence. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=59.22s)]
*  A Defense Department official clarified U.S. military liaisons were already on the ground [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=67.98s)]
*  in Israel and attached to the U.S. embassy before Hamas invaded. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=73.06s)]
*  Special operations personnel were already on the ground in Israel as part of their jobs [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=77.98s)]
*  at the embassy or in support of unit-to-unit bilateral training agreements between U.S. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  and Israeli special operations. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=86.98s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Ministry released this footage of a direct weapons shipment from [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=89.18s)]
*  the U.S. landing at Nevatim Air Base in southern Israel yesterday. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=93.66s)]
*  President Biden promised additional military assistance, including ammunition and interceptors [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=98.18s)]
*  for the Iron Dome. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=102.62s)]
*  U.S. defense officials have told Fox News that this is not because Israel is running [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=103.97999999999999s)]
*  out of ammunition, but because the U.S. is trying to deter a broader conflict from happening. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=108.38s)]
*  Boeing accelerated the delivery of 1,000 smart bombs to Israel after the Hamas attacks. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  We stand ready to move in additional assets as needed. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=120.38s)]
*  Let me say again to any country, any organization, anyone thinking of taking advantage of this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=123.25999999999999s)]
*  situation, I have one word. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=130.66s)]
*  Meanwhile, the USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group is now on station in the Eastern [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=134.3s)]
*  Mediterranean and will be joined by the USS Eisenhower carrier strike group, which will [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=140.3s)]
*  be leaving Norfolk, Virginia on Friday in a previously scheduled deployment to the region. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=145.38000000000002s)]
*  Secretary Austin held a third phone call with Israel Defense Minister Yoav Galant reiterating [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=150.82000000000002s)]
*  U.S. support. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=156.58s)]
*  Quote, my focus is on making sure we can do everything we can do to help contain this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=157.58s)]
*  to the point where it doesn't spread throughout the region and also do everything we can to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=162.26s)]
*  support Israel in its efforts. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=166.5s)]
*  Austin told reporters en route to meet NATO defense ministers in Brussels. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=168.89999999999998s)]
*  Harris. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=173.85999999999999s)]
*  General Jack Keene, retired Army four-star general, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  also chairman of the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=180.29999999999998s)]
*  I welcome you in focus today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=183.45999999999998s)]
*  General, first of all, I don't know if you could hear Jennifer's reporting, but there [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=186.1s)]
*  is now an imminent situation that we're told about a ground war. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=190.85999999999999s)]
*  Can you walk us through strategically what that could look like and what the implications [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=195.62s)]
*  are? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=200.9s)]
*  Yes, certainly, Harris. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=201.9s)]
*  What's happening here is we have four major adversaries in the world, China, Russia, Iran [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=205.62s)]
*  and North Korea in that order. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=212.01999999999998s)]
*  And we have, and all of them, interesting enough, have stepped up their aggression in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=214.57999999999998s)]
*  recent years. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=218.9s)]
*  Why do you think that's happening? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=219.98000000000002s)]
*  They perceive the United States is weak and has gotten weaker and possibly even in decline. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=221.74s)]
*  At least, that's something President Xi and Putin both believe. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=227.9s)]
*  And then we have three geographic areas in the world that contain our vital interests. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=232.34s)]
*  One is Europe. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=237.1s)]
*  And Russia has started a war in Europe to defeat Ukraine, take ownership of it, and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=238.58s)]
*  indicated many times that they intend to expand. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=244.5s)]
*  We cannot let Russia win that war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=247.84s)]
*  All of this is connected. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=251.24s)]
*  In the Pacific, President Xi is telling us that if Taiwan doesn't voluntarily reunify, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=253.44s)]
*  that he will take it by force. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=261.48s)]
*  And he's told his forces to be ready by 27. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=263.44s)]
*  He is threatening war in the Pacific, which would be catastrophic in terms of the war [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=266.5s)]
*  itself and the implications for mankind and the economy. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=272.6s)]
*  Now we have Iran. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=277.36s)]
*  And let's stop fiddling around with it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=278.36s)]
*  Iran has started a war in the Middle East using its proxies, in this case Hamas, possibly [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=280.16s)]
*  expand with Hezbollah and Syria and others. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=285.8s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=289.0s)]
*  To destroy the state of Israel. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=290.0s)]
*  Israel must win this war. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  Strategically, the alternative is absolutely unacceptable or reset the entire table in [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=296.64000000000004s)]
*  the Middle East if Israel lost this war. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=302.48s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=306.0s)]
*  That means if Israel needs our help militarily, and they have never asked for our troops since [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=307.0s)]
*  1948, not one time, they've asked for our equipment and our munitions, but if they need [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  our help, then we give them whatever it needs for them to win, period, because the alternative [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=317.24s)]
*  strategically is absolutely unacceptable. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=323.56s)]
*  These three regions of the world are related to each other as are our adversaries who are [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=327.04s)]
*  absolutely attempting to take advantage of the United States. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  All right, I want to ask something that's pretty probably obvious to our viewers as [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=336.96s)]
*  you're talking. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  And I wanted to ask it immediately when you said if Israel needs our help, they've never [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  asked for troops before, but we would be there. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=347.46s)]
*  What does that mean for the fight in Ukraine? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=350.64s)]
*  Because they would love nothing more than for us to do even more to help them win that [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=353.28s)]
*  war against Russia. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=358.24s)]
*  How does the United States balance what it has? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=359.96s)]
*  I mean, clearly our relationship with Israel is far more important than special and special [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=362.48s)]
*  both diplomatically, strategically, all of it with Israel. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  They are family. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=374.20000000000005s)]
*  What is Ukraine in all of this scenario? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=375.56s)]
*  Well, certainly it emphasizes, I think, the significance of making certain that Russia [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=378.6s)]
*  is defeated in Ukraine. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=385.16s)]
*  Can we do both? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=386.84000000000003s)]
*  And they don't expand beyond that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=387.84000000000003s)]
*  Yes, we can do both. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=389.72s)]
*  Look at it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=391.56s)]
*  Zelensky's got owns now 83 percent of his territory. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=393.56s)]
*  He's defeated half of the Russian's combat forces and we haven't provided a single troop [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  to that effort. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=402.47999999999996s)]
*  We've just provided weapons. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=403.47999999999996s)]
*  That's a heck of a return on investment. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=405.28s)]
*  We're going to help Israel here and we're going to do it with support and obviously [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=407.76s)]
*  also with moral support. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=412.24s)]
*  And that's very good. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  And I applaud the president for providing that kind of moral support. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  But if they need more than that, my point is we have to give it. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=418.52s)]
*  We cannot let Israel lose this war because implications in the Middle East are catastrophic [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=423.24s)]
*  and it is catastrophic for Israel. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=429.71999999999997s)]
*  So my other question has to do and I'm sure viewers who are watching carefully and they [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=431.79999999999995s)]
*  do. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=436.2s)]
*  I mean, the American public is paying attention. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=437.2s)]
*  They know what's at stake here. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=439.74s)]
*  When you hear our reporter, Jennifer Griffin, say, oh, no, no, no, there's no there are [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=442.7s)]
*  no markings of Iran that the Pentagon can prove on this. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=447.4s)]
*  And then they hear me say this thing's got oven mitts that say Iran on them and they're [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  using them in Syria and Lebanon to make sure that those guys are part of the game, too. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  And then you say there's no mistake about it. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=460.53999999999996s)]
*  Iran is in this game. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=463.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, does the Pentagon not see it? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=464.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this is an absurdity in my view. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=468.96s)]
*  I mean, they're trying to find a piece of information. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=470.84s)]
*  What are they trying to find? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=473.35999999999996s)]
*  I mean, this is an order that somebody gave or eased up on a conversation. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=475.36s)]
*  And this is an organization that Jake Sullivan admitted broadly is complicit and provided [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=479.36s)]
*  training, financing and support to support IRGC leaders visit Hamas on a regular basis. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=485.0s)]
*  They visit Hezbollah on a regular on a regular basis. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=492.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, the next words out of their mouth after he said they're broadly complicit and [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=495.48s)]
*  should have said and we should make the assumption that Iran is heavily involved in the planning, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=501.08s)]
*  preparation and coordination and green light of this war. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=506.64s)]
*  That should have been made even without having eavesdropped on a piece of evidence that suggests [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=511.0s)]
*  that they took action. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=518.48s)]
*  We know they took action. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=520.64s)]
*  Let's make the assumption that they've done that. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=522.32s)]
*  And I think that's that's what we expect from our leaders to draw conclusions, strategic [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=525.0799999999999s)]
*  conclusions from what's happening right in front of us and inform the American people. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=530.92s)]
*  Look at the Israelis are very, very complimentary to the administration over their support to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=535.16s)]
*  them, as they should be. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=540.52s)]
*  But when you hear the the Israeli ambassador, UN said, but we have our fundamental differences. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=542.1999999999999s)]
*  You know what that fundamental difference is? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=548.5999999999999s)]
*  It's all over Iran. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=550.68s)]
*  They believe the United States is appeasing Iran has had the wrong strategy in dealing [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=553.16s)]
*  with one since its administration took over. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=557.48s)]
*  And they know full well that Iran is completely complicit in using Hamas to try to destroy [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=560.72s)]
*  Israel. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=567.68s)]
*  That's a fact. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=568.68s)]
*  And they know Hezbollah, if they come into the war, has the same mission statement. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=569.68s)]
*  And who is telling them to do that? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=574.0s)]
*  Iran is telling them to do that. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=576.12s)]
*  We got to put the facts on the table and draw some conclusions here about what is really [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=577.68s)]
*  happening and educate the American people. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  I understand why they don't want to say that, because that implies what are we going to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=586.3599999999999s)]
*  do about it? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=590.4399999999999s)]
*  And it implies, well, we must have we must take some action. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=591.4399999999999s)]
*  But, you know, General, for those of us who and of course, you served, I'm just the child [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=595.3199999999999s)]
*  of somebody who was gifted, who served. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=602.28s)]
*  But look, I mean, if you say it or you don't say it, it doesn't change the fact. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=604.7600000000001s)]
*  If it's Iran, eventually we are going to have to do something. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=610.8000000000001s)]
*  Maybe by naming it, we can begin to decide what that something is going to do. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=614.6s)]
*  Again, I'm not looking at it from 37,000 feet with your experience, but you don't change [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=618.6s)]
*  the fact just because you can't find a piece of paper that says Iran's guy did this. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=624.6800000000001s)]
*  There are plenty of things that we may know to be true without that. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=630.08s)]
*  I mean, we've been at war before. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=635.24s)]
*  We know. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=636.84s)]
*  Look, sooner or later, we're going to have to make a decision about what's happening [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=637.84s)]
*  in Lebanon and Syria. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=641.48s)]
*  And I want to get your thoughts on that. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=643.32s)]
*  You open up another front in this war. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=644.82s)]
*  And does that then potentially do what you said, which is they've never asked for our [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=647.64s)]
*  boots on the ground before? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=652.0400000000001s)]
*  And I don't want to use that term because they're human beings in those boots. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=653.0400000000001s)]
*  Our troops, our soldiers, our Navy, everybody. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=657.58s)]
*  But do you think that could tip us? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=660.0200000000001s)]
*  Well, that would be Israel's call. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=662.38s)]
*  Look, there's 130,000 rockets and missiles that Iran has provided to Hezbollah. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=666.0600000000001s)]
*  And they've done, created this arsenal over a number of years. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=673.4200000000001s)]
*  And in most recent years, they're giving them advanced missiles. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=676.34s)]
*  So they have greater range, greater lethality and greater precision than anything that Hamas [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=680.6400000000001s)]
*  has. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=685.82s)]
*  They can reach all of Israeli cities. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=686.82s)]
*  If they are able to overwhelm the air defense systems and their air power, their fighter [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=690.26s)]
*  jets and their cruise missiles and their artillery cannot destroy all the launchers and the infrastructure [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=695.98s)]
*  that supports them. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=703.0600000000001s)]
*  And they're beginning to take significant casualties on a regular basis, it's reasonable [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=704.46s)]
*  that they would ask the United States for help. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=710.4200000000001s)]
*  And what kind of help would we provide them? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=713.1s)]
*  We would give them air support. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=714.8199999999999s)]
*  We're not talking about troops on the ground, air support. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=717.16s)]
*  And we would and it would be significant. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=720.04s)]
*  We're moving it into the region. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=722.8199999999999s)]
*  We brought a couple of fighter squadrons in the region. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=724.2s)]
*  We already have significant capability in the region. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=726.84s)]
*  And we would use cruise missiles, et cetera, to do that. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=730.28s)]
*  I'm sure we've shared all the intelligence we have on where those launches are, where [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=732.84s)]
*  the infrastructure is compared to what they have. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=737.48s)]
*  And they probably have a pretty good feel for what they got to do. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=740.8s)]
*  But if the Israelis can't do it by themselves and they ask, I cannot imagine an American [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  president saying no to that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=748.76s)]
*  So yes, we could get into this. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=750.72s)]
*  Hopefully we don't have to get into it. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=752.52s)]
*  And the Israelis can deal with this by themselves. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=754.32s)]
*  But we got to be prepared to do it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=756.5600000000001s)]
*  And I'll take it at face value. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=758.5s)]
*  That's why we're moving all the ships in there and the support in there, not just to show [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=760.4s)]
*  a force to deter, but to convince them that we would come to Israel's aid. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=765.5600000000001s)]
*  I would have said those words publicly in the president's speech yesterday. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=771.64s)]
*  I wouldn't have just said, don't do it. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=775.88s)]
*  And we have this capability here. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=778.92s)]
*  I would have told them I would use it. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=781.12s)]
*  Deterrence has two factors to it, Harris. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=783.72s)]
*  Factor one is the capability. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=786.48s)]
*  And that capability we just put in the region and some of it's already there. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=788.0600000000001s)]
*  Factor number two, you have to convince your adversary that you're going to use it. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=792.12s)]
*  And I would have used those words. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=797.48s)]
*  If you come into this war and the Israelis need help, then the United States is going [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=799.84s)]
*  to come and help them and we will destroy you. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=805.08s)]
*  And I would have said words to that effect, whatever words he's comfortable saying, but [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=809.24s)]
*  much more specific. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=813.36s)]
*  So they there's no you don't want your adversary to have any doubt about it. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=815.4s)]
*  If you're really using it as a deterrence and he's using that word, that's why the forces [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=820.5600000000001s)]
*  are there. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=825.2800000000001s)]
*  You're talking to make the commitment that you'll help that you'll help. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=826.2800000000001s)]
*  You're talking about the USS Gerald Ford that arrived yesterday and then reports that the [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=829.5999999999999s)]
*  Eisenhower is on its way now. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=834.0s)]
*  And you know, I wrote down what you said. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=836.2399999999999s)]
*  It's brilliant. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=838.0s)]
*  Deterrence has two factors, capability. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=840.04s)]
*  And I wrote in conviction to use it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=842.0s)]
*  I want to point to and I thank you for that because it really does speak to kind of the [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=844.56s)]
*  empty word. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=850.52s)]
*  Sometimes we hear politicians say as they try to search to find the words that will [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=851.52s)]
*  be less incendiary. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=856.4s)]
*  Everything is on fire right now. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=858.3s)]
*  I want everybody to look to the left of their screen. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=859.44s)]
*  Israel is fighting back against these terrorists. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=862.36s)]
*  That is Gaza. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=865.08s)]
*  And we just saw, General, a huge amount of black smoke go up in the center of that city. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=866.24s)]
*  And it's dissipating a bit now. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=873.3000000000001s)]
*  What are they hitting them with? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=875.4000000000001s)]
*  What can they do during the daytime? [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=876.82s)]
*  And then how does that change at night? [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=879.12s)]
*  Well, what's taking place here in terms of fires is two things. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=881.32s)]
*  The Israelis are still attempting to suppress the rockets and missiles that are still in [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=887.4s)]
*  the Gaza Strip area. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=892.3199999999999s)]
*  And obviously they're very good at hiding and protecting those missiles and launchers [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=893.72s)]
*  except when they're going to use them. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=898.6s)]
*  So that's you see fighter jets attack helicopters, work in that target. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=900.48s)]
*  But then it seems that the Israelis have just about told everybody they're going to go into [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=906.28s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=911.22s)]
*  So they're using pre-assault fires, military terminology, to prepare and help prepare a [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=912.3s)]
*  pathway for them to move ground forces in. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=920.02s)]
*  And they obviously have some pretty good intelligence on what's in there and where it is. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=923.9799999999999s)]
*  And that's what those pre-assault fires are targeting. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=929.5s)]
*  That black smoke, they probably hit something that dealt with either ammunition or fuel [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=932.3199999999999s)]
*  to get that is likely a military target that they hit. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=938.64s)]
*  And this ground force moving into Gaza, this is going to be very different than anything [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  they've done before, which normally I use the term hard and fast. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=949.52s)]
*  A lot of firepower, get it over with a week, 10 days, three weeks at the outset and get [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=954.1600000000001s)]
*  out of there. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=961.8000000000001s)]
*  This time they've changed the mission. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=964.6s)]
*  The mission before was to set Hamas and Islamic Jihad back a number of years. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=967.5799999999999s)]
*  Now the mission is to eliminate them as a political entity, which means they have to [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=973.7399999999999s)]
*  bring have to have somebody else to run Gaza at some time, likely to fatah on the West [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=978.9s)]
*  Bank. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=984.6999999999999s)]
*  Well, we'll see. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=985.6999999999999s)]
*  But the military operation is very different because they want to destroy the entire Hamas [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=986.9799999999999s)]
*  network. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=993.5s)]
*  That means the leaders, the fighters, all of their military infrastructure, the tunnel [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=994.6s)]
*  complexes. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=998.5600000000001s)]
*  That means neighborhood by neighborhood, block by block, building by building very systematically [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=999.8000000000001s)]
*  will likely take weeks and months. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=1005.32s)]
*  And you have to have patience. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=1007.6s)]
*  And the United States leaders have to have patience. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=1009.4000000000001s)]
*  And the international leaders have to have patience in dealing with this. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=1012.24s)]
*  This is a much longer and much more complicated operation. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=1016.44s)]
*  General Keene, thank you. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfqkgE65EU&t=1021.24s)]
