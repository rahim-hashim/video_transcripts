# Senator calls for immediate deportation of Hamas supporters
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM)
*  Meanwhile, Senator Tom Cotton demanding DHS Secretary of my work is take control of America's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=0.0s)]
*  borders before the open policies allow Hamas supporters to bring the conflict on U.S. soil, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=4.36s)]
*  saying, quote, I write to urge you to immediately deport any foreign national, including any, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=10.08s)]
*  especially any alien on a student visa that has expressed support for Hamas and its murderous [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  attacks on Israel. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=20.84s)]
*  These fifth columnists have no place in the United States. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=22.56s)]
*  This is really interesting, Bill, because a lot of people are saying let's not take [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=27.64s)]
*  our eye off the border. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=31.0s)]
*  We've seen Griff Jenkins and others reporting at the border. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=32.44s)]
*  There are people coming over the border from Iran. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=35.84s)]
*  Currently, we are getting reports of that. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=39.24s)]
*  So this is obviously an important part of the ongoing story that is happening there [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=41.86s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=45.56s)]
*  Some of the things that you wonder about now, because these terrorists learn and they adjust [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=46.56s)]
*  and they have made adjustments. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=51.1s)]
*  of 9-11 and how they infiltrated America and kept quiet. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=53.44s)]
*  It appears that these Hamas terrorists did the same thing in Gaza, operating perhaps [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=58.12s)]
*  in small groups and not communicating with any sort of electronics, but really face-to-face [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=62.68s)]
*  communication. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=66.92s)]
*  That border has been open for two years, Sandra, and the imagination runs wild as to whether [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  or not those folks are here now. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=72.24s)]
*  And if they are, are they planning and plotting and doing it in a way where we would not be [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=75.4s)]
*  able to detect them? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-XgZ3ez7RM&t=79.68s)]
