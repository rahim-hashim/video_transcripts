# Reporter presses Secretary Blinken on $6 billion to Iran amid Hamas attacks
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg)
*  In my meetings with the Prime Minister, with President Herzog, with the ministers in Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=0.0s)]
*  newly formed national emergency government, we discussed in detail what Israel needs to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=6.96s)]
*  defend itself, its people, and how the United States can help to meet those needs. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=11.64s)]
*  We're delivering on those needs as we speak, and we will work closely and swiftly with [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=16.6s)]
*  Congress to meet them as they evolve. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=21.92s)]
*  This afternoon, I met with families of American citizens that Hamas has killed or taken hostage. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=26.04s)]
*  The enormity of their anguish, their loss, is immeasurable. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=34.92s)]
*  For the families of the missing, there's an unrelenting agony of not knowing the fate [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=43.04s)]
*  of their loved ones, something that I don't think most of us can truly understand, truly [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=48.76s)]
*  contemplate if you're not in their shoes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=53.92s)]
*  No one should have to endure what they're going through. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=57.300000000000004s)]
*  There are so many families like them. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  The United States is one of more than 30 countries where family members, friends, entire communities [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=62.92s)]
*  are being forced to go through this wrenching experience because of Hamas' disdain for [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=70.04s)]
*  human life and basic human dignity. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=75.16s)]
*  We're doing everything we can to secure the release of the hostages, working closely [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=80.64s)]
*  with our Israeli partners. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=84.16s)]
*  I brought with me to Israel our Deputy Special Representative for Hostage Affairs, Steve [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=85.62s)]
*  Gillen, who joined my meetings with the families and will stay on the ground here to support [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=90.16s)]
*  the efforts to free their loved ones. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=95.4s)]
*  I also had a chance to see up close the genuinely inspiring solidarity of the Israeli people [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=98.8s)]
*  in the wake of Hamas' attacks. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=105.52s)]
*  I visited one of the many sites where citizens have swiftly organized efforts to collect, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=108.67999999999999s)]
*  to sort, to distribute donations to those in need, including many families who have [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  been displaced from the South. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=117.88s)]
*  I had a chance to meet with some of the volunteers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=118.88s)]
*  Several of them dual-U.S. Israeli citizens. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=122.75999999999999s)]
*  One young couple told me how they narrowly escaped with their own lives when Hamas terrorists [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=126.44s)]
*  attacked the Supernova Music Festival. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=131.56s)]
*  They told me about their friends who were not fortunate, who were killed at that festival. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=134.96s)]
*  Others taken hostage or still missing. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=142.08s)]
*  In our time here in Israel, everywhere we've gone, we've met people who've been touched [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=147.96s)]
*  in one way or another by Hamas' bloody hand. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  A loved one, a friend, a classmate, a neighbor, a colleague. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=156.96s)]
*  Killed, maimed, missing. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=162.96s)]
*  We encountered a nation knit together by grief, but also a nation united in resolve. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=166.96s)]
*  The United States shares that resolve. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=173.96s)]
*  We stand shoulder to shoulder with the people of Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=177.44s)]
*  From here, I'll go on to Jordan, where I'll meet with His Majesty King Abdullah and with [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=181.8s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority President Abbas. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=185.84s)]
*  And then over the coming days, we'll visit with leaders in Saudi Arabia, the United Arab [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=188.44s)]
*  Emirates, Egypt, and Qatar. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  Across each of these engagements, we'll continue pressing countries to help prevent [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=196.04s)]
*  the conflict from spreading and to use our leverage with Hamas to immediately and unconditionally [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=199.68s)]
*  release the hostages. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=206.68s)]
*  We'll also discuss how we can continue to make real our affirmative vision for a region [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=208.28s)]
*  that's more peaceful, more prosperous, more secure, more integrated. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=214.68s)]
*  And in fact, that is the choice. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=220.4s)]
*  And the choice in some ways has been made even more stark by the actions of Hamas on [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=223.16s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=229.08s)]
*  One path forward is a region that comes together, integrated, normalized relations among its [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=231.44s)]
*  countries, people working in common purpose, common benefit, more peaceful, more stable. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=239.76s)]
*  Then there's the path that Hamas has shown in stark, clear light. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=249.76s)]
*  Terror, destruction, nihilism. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=256.76s)]
*  The choice could not be more clear. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=262.72s)]
*  We know the choice that we're making, our partners are making. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=265.68s)]
*  We have work to do to carry it through. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=270.12s)]
*  In all that I did today, I was supported by an exceptional team here in Israel. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=276.2s)]
*  It's been doing crucial work in incredibly difficult conditions, led by remarkable chargé [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=280.04s)]
*  d'affaires, Stephanie Howitt. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=285.2s)]
*  Stephanie's doing an extraordinary job. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=288.68s)]
*  We also look forward to welcoming our future ambassador, Jack Lew, to Israel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=291.0s)]
*  As many here know, Hamas launched this attack on Simchat Torah. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=295.36s)]
*  This is the day that Jews celebrate finishing the reading of the Torah. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=300.8s)]
*  This Saturday, Jews around the world will chant the first words of the book of Genesis. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=304.8s)]
*  They'll read that in the beginning there was darkness and then there was light. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=309.2s)]
*  That the first person was alone until a partner joined them. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=317.0s)]
*  I'm standing here today alongside our Israeli friends and all those who reject terror to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=324.08s)]
*  help find the glimmers of light even in this moment of deep darkness and to make clear [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=331.8s)]
*  that as long as there's the United States, Israel will never be alone. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=337.8s)]
*  With that, happy to take some questions. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=344.36s)]
*  First question goes to Sean Tandon with AFP. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=347.42s)]
*  Thank you Mr. Secretary, good evening. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=351.84s)]
*  Can I just ask you to begin with Prime Minister Netanyahu has shared what are very gruesome [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=354.52s)]
*  photos. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=361.4s)]
*  He said that he shared them with you. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=362.4s)]
*  I know they're very disturbing to look at but I wanted to see first of all what your [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=363.4s)]
*  reaction was to those. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=367.79999999999995s)]
*  If I may, well understanding and acknowledging the great suffering that's been experienced [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=369.64s)]
*  by Israelis. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=374.52s)]
*  There was a lot of concern in some quarters about the situation in Gaza as well. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=375.52s)]
*  People looking for food in light of the cutoff. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=379.84s)]
*  Was that discussed at all in terms of the humanitarian situation in Gaza? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=383.88s)]
*  Was there any call for easing some of these conditions or for restraint as we expect a [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=386.52s)]
*  ground offensive? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=392.4s)]
*  If you'll allow me just one thing that's been reported just recently. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=393.4s)]
*  There was a report in the Washington Post that the United States and Qatar have decided [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  to slow down or suspend the access that Iran has to the $6 billion that's been put in a [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=403.76s)]
*  special account. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=408.72s)]
*  Could you say if this is accurate and if it is could you explain whether this is a slowdown [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=409.72s)]
*  or something more formal than that? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=414.52000000000004s)]
*  Thanks very much. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=416.0s)]
*  Great. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=417.0s)]
*  Thanks Sean. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=418.0s)]
*  So we did see photographs, videos that the Israeli government shared with us. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=419.44000000000005s)]
*  Some I think has actually already been seen in public media. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=427.24s)]
*  Others were new to me and I think new to our team. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  It's hard to find the right words. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=439.52s)]
*  It's beyond what anyone would ever want to imagine much less actually see and God forbid [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=442.88s)]
*  experience. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=453.24s)]
*  A baby, an infant, riddled with bullets. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=456.44s)]
*  Soldiers beheaded. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=463.71999999999997s)]
*  Young people burned alive in their cars or in their hideaway rooms. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=466.88s)]
*  I could go on but it's simply depravity in the worst imaginable way. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  It almost defies comprehension. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=489.12s)]
*  As I've been saying to me in the most immediate future harkens back to ISIS and some of the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=493.32s)]
*  very things we saw when it was on its rampage that thankfully was stopped. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  So I think for any human being to see this it's really beyond almost anything that we [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=511.04s)]
*  can comprehend, digest. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  And I just add that when you see this you try to imagine, maybe not try, you can't [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  help but imagine yourself, your family, your loved ones, your friends in that situation, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=537.96s)]
*  in that predicament. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=549.6s)]
*  And maybe the best word for it for me is overwhelming. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=552.5600000000001s)]
*  I think what it's done is as I said united a country in profound grief but also united [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=561.28s)]
*  a country in resolve. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=571.0s)]
*  And it's imperative that the rest of us share that resolve. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=573.8s)]
*  I said this earlier. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=579.44s)]
*  This is a moment for moral clarity. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=583.0s)]
*  This is a moment where everyone needs to make clear that there is revulsion, disgust, and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=587.64s)]
*  a determination, a determination not to allow this to go forward. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=604.1999999999999s)]
*  So images are worth a thousand words. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=611.92s)]
*  These images may be worth a million. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=618.36s)]
*  On the Mediterranean situation in Gaza, I think it's first important to remember a [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=624.56s)]
*  fundamental issue that makes this complicated. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=632.04s)]
*  Hamas continues to use civilians as human shields. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=636.76s)]
*  Something that's not new, something that they've always done. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=641.3199999999999s)]
*  Intentionally putting civilians in harm's way to try to protect themselves or protect [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=645.0799999999999s)]
*  their infrastructure or protect their weapons. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=651.4s)]
*  So that's one of the basic facts that Israel has to deal with. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=655.9599999999999s)]
*  And of course civilians should not be used in any way as the targets of military operations. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=660.8399999999999s)]
*  They are not the target of Israel's operations. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=668.1999999999999s)]
*  We did discuss ways to address the humanitarian needs of people living in Gaza, to protect [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  them from harm while Israel conducts its legitimate security operations to defend itself from [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=676.4399999999999s)]
*  terrorism and to try to ensure that this never happens again. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=681.56s)]
*  We also talked about possibilities for safe passage for civilians who want to leave or [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=686.12s)]
*  get out of the way in Gaza. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=692.68s)]
*  And that's a conversation, a discussion that we will pursue in the coming days, including [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=694.68s)]
*  with some of the countries that we'll be visiting. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=700.2399999999999s)]
*  So this is important and this is an area for focus. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=702.56s)]
*  With regard to the $6 billion first, again, it's always worth repeating the facts because [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=709.88s)]
*  unfortunately the facts get lost along the way. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=716.4799999999999s)]
*  The money that Iran accrued in bank accounts, in this case in South Korea, for the sale [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=721.16s)]
*  of its oil was done pursuant to an arrangement established by the previous administration, [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=729.1999999999999s)]
*  the Trump administration. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=735.0s)]
*  None of the funds that have now gone to Qatar have actually been spent or accessed in any [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=736.92s)]
*  By Iran indeed, funds from that account are overseen by the Treasury Department, can only [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=745.16s)]
*  be dispensed for humanitarian goods, food, medicine, medical equipment, and never touch [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=751.48s)]
*  Iranian hands. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=759.16s)]
*  We have strict oversight of the funds and we retain the right to freeze them. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=761.42s)]
*  Next question goes to Gil Tamary with Channel 13. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=769.16s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you very much. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=773.28s)]
*  Gil Tamary, Channel 13, Israel. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=775.72s)]
*  The President compared rightfully Hamas' horrendous massacre to ISIS. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=778.24s)]
*  Can you provide assurance to Israel that the Biden administration will not attempt to halt [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=784.56s)]
*  Israel's effort until the goal of eliminating Hamas from Gaza is completely achieved, regardless [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=790.64s)]
*  of how long it may take? [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=799.0s)]
*  And with your permission, second question, if Hezbollah opens a second front in the north, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=801.0s)]
*  can we expect that if needed the U.S. will use its military assets in the region to fight [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=808.8s)]
*  against Hezbollah together with the idea? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=815.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=821.4399999999999s)]
*  With regard to the first question, the President's been very clear, I've been very clear, we [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=823.2s)]
*  stand with Israel. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=830.2s)]
*  We stand with Israel in its determination to defend its people, defend its country. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=831.76s)]
*  We stand with Israel in its determination to do everything possible to ensure that what [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=836.94s)]
*  happened on Saturday never happens again. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=841.46s)]
*  And in that determination, we are of course, as you know, providing assistance as requested [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=845.6400000000001s)]
*  by Israel for its efforts. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=852.24s)]
*  That will continue, and we're working closely with Congress to make sure that Israel has [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=853.9s)]
*  what it needs to do what it must. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=858.74s)]
*  With regard to the second front, as I mentioned earlier, it's our determination and that [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=862.6s)]
*  of Israel as well that there not be a second front or a third front. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=871.02s)]
*  And we are working as hard as we can, working with other partners in the region to try to [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=877.58s)]
*  ensure that that's the case. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=885.74s)]
*  The President has also been very clear, President Biden, he's been very clear that no one, state [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=888.38s)]
*  or non-state actor, should try to take advantage of this moment. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=896.42s)]
*  And he's backed up that warning with the deployment of our largest carrier group, the [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=901.98s)]
*  Gerald R. Ford, as well as again making sure that Israel has what it needs and that we [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=912.82s)]
*  also have appropriate assets in place. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=921.12s)]
*  Beyond that, I'm not going to speculate on future events. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=923.62s)]
*  For the next question, Ed Wong with the New York Times. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=927.54s)]
*  Thank you, Secretary Blinken. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=934.54s)]
*  Many people have likened the horrendous violence by Hamas to the attacks of 9-11 in the U.S. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=936.4599999999999s)]
*  As you know, the U.S. earned lots of goodwill after those attacks and there were many expressions [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=943.4599999999999s)]
*  of solidarity for the U.S. from around the world. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=951.3399999999999s)]
*  Soon afterwards, the U.S. squandered that goodwill when it began its invasion of Iraq. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=954.5400000000001s)]
*  And now, decades onward in retrospect, many people think that the most lasting consequences [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=959.0600000000001s)]
*  of 9-11 were the two wars that many Americans deemed were disasters in hindsight. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=964.6600000000001s)]
*  And so I wonder what lessons might you have for Israel as a friend of Israel looking back [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=971.26s)]
*  at the aftermath of 9-11. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=979.5s)]
*  Second, I wonder whether your team has an assessment of what Hamas' goals were in carrying [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=982.4599999999999s)]
*  out the attacks and whether it has gotten any closer to those goals with these attacks. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=989.98s)]
*  Thanks, Ed. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=997.5799999999999s)]
*  First let me say this with regard to 9-11. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1000.1s)]
*  If you look at this in proportion to the size of Israel's population, this is the equivalent [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1004.14s)]
*  of 10 9-11s. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1009.5s)]
*  That's how big and how devastating this attack has been. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1013.98s)]
*  And of course, each of these situations is very different and it's important to keep [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1019.7800000000001s)]
*  that in mind. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1030.46s)]
*  Of course, we're always trying to draw the lessons from past experience, as they may [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1032.82s)]
*  or may not be applicable to what we or our partners are doing now. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1037.4s)]
*  And of course, we are in very close conversation with Israel about the work it's undertaking, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1042.2800000000002s)]
*  as I said, to make sure it can defend itself, defend its citizens, and to the best of its [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1048.8000000000002s)]
*  ability ensure that this doesn't happen again. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1054.1200000000001s)]
*  Those are the objectives. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1058.3600000000001s)]
*  Again, I'll leave the operational details to Israel and simply say again that as we [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1060.64s)]
*  have these discussions, we're looking at past experiences, including many past experiences [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1069.64s)]
*  more immediate to this challenge, including in Gaza and including in the region. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1075.4s)]
*  With regard to the goals of Hamas, I think that is a question that we have to consider [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1082.96s)]
*  mostly on which I could speculate but not give you any kind of clear definitive answer. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1090.28s)]
*  There are a number of possible explanations. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1097.52s)]
*  We have not heard from them what their goals are. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1100.24s)]
*  And I have to tell you that in many ways, the simplest explanation may be the most compelling. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1103.4s)]
*  This is pure evil. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1114.8s)]
*  There may be second or third order interests. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1118.58s)]
*  For example, I've noted this before, we've been engaged, as you know, in trying to support [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1123.1399999999999s)]
*  and advance the possibility of normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia and other [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1129.22s)]
*  countries that do not yet have normalized relations with Israel. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1134.5s)]
*  Something that is very challenging, very difficult, but also very possible, and something that [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1139.1799999999998s)]
*  would have a profound effect on the region, on the countries in question, and on the region, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1145.9s)]
*  a region that's been in turmoil for so many decades that through normalization, through [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1151.38s)]
*  greater integration, then has a path to much greater stability, much greater peace, much [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1156.22s)]
*  greater opportunity for everyone in the region. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1164.38s)]
*  Now who opposes normalization? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1167.7800000000002s)]
*  Hamas, Hezbollah, Iran. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1170.3400000000001s)]
*  I think that speaks volumes as well. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1175.02s)]
*  And the final question goes to Christine Renawi with Al-RB News. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1178.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1185.26s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, did you discuss with Netanyahu the need for Israel to commit to international [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1188.66s)]
*  law on their war in Gaza, and any more details about the humanitarian corridors in Gaza? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1196.42s)]
*  And following on my colleague's question, the spokesperson of the White House retracted [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1204.38s)]
*  President Biden's claim of seeing pictures of beheaded children. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1214.18s)]
*  But today you mentioned in your press conference about the babies slaughtered and the woman [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1221.5800000000002s)]
*  raped. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1228.18s)]
*  Did you see the evidence of that? [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1229.1000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1231.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1232.34s)]
*  To the first part of your question, I think you've heard the President address this. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1234.34s)]
*  I've also addressed it in different ways, which is to say this. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1237.9399999999998s)]
*  For democracies like the United States, like Israel, it's vitally important that we respect [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1243.26s)]
*  and follow international law, humanitarian law, the law of war as applicable, and that [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1253.82s)]
*  it's a standard that we hold ourselves to, and it's a standard that we look to, including [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1262.58s)]
*  if and when we fall short of it. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1270.3s)]
*  So this is something that motivates both of us, and of course it's what distinguishes [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1272.3799999999999s)]
*  us and other democracies around the world from terrorist organizations like Hamas, which [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1276.4199999999998s)]
*  have absolutely no regard for the rule of law, for humanitarian, for the United States, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1284.6599999999999s)]
*  for the United States' rules and rights, for any basic standards of human decency. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1292.62s)]
*  On the contrary, as we were discussing just a few minutes ago, they quite literally and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1299.62s)]
*  deliberately target civilians, and not just target civilians, target them in the most [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1304.3s)]
*  inhumane ways possible, and at the same time use them as human shields. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1313.82s)]
*  That's a profound distinction between our countries and a group like Hamas. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1322.34s)]
*  When it comes to the photographs, the videos, I describe what I saw today. That doesn't [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1330.9399999999998s)]
*  mean it's the entire universe. We had an opportunity to see some of the photographs [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1336.1399999999999s)]
*  and videos. Unfortunately, there are many, many, many others, and every day the world [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1341.4599999999998s)]
*  is seeing new evidence of the depravity and the inhumanity of Hamas, depravity and inhumanity [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1349.46s)]
*  directed at babies, at small children, at young adults, at elderly people, at people [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GxeUjO23vgg&t=1356.46s)]
