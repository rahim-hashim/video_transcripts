# ‘No evidence’ Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire will hold, says Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0)
*  All right, let's bring in Mike Pompeo, former secretary of state, former CIA director and a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=0.0s)]
*  Fox News contributor. Mr. Secretary, the NATO secretary of general, Secretary General Mark Ruta [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=4.0s)]
*  warns not to be naive following this Hezbollah deal. Listen to what he said. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=10.72s)]
*  And I welcome it, but let's not be naive. Hezbollah is still there, Iran is still backing Hezbollah. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=15.52s)]
*  So it is good that it is there, but now it has to be implemented. Let's see what happens, whether [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=23.36s)]
*  they will keep to the deal, the Hezbollah people. So as you know, Mr. Secretary, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=28.32s)]
*  Hezbollah does not have a particularly stellar record when it comes to upholding their end of a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=32.88s)]
*  bargain. Well, John, good to be with you. Not a particularly stellar record is great diplomatic [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=36.88s)]
*  speak. You might well work at the State Department one day. No, they've been horrific. They have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  violated every promise they've made, every agreement. They have always rearmed. There's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=48.96s)]
*  no reason to think that they will behave any differently, that their end aims, the destruction [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=52.88s)]
*  of Israel has changed in any fundamental way. So this will be about implementation, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=58.08s)]
*  about monitoring. Can the Israelis return to the north safely, their homes in the north safely? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=62.56s)]
*  And then will the Lebanese Armed Forces have the capability to do what they had promised [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=68.24s)]
*  they would do along with the United Nations was enforce these restrictions on Hezbollah. There's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=72.72s)]
*  no evidence in play that suggests that they will be able to do that over the long run. And the [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=78.08s)]
*  Israelis have reserved their right properly to return to conflict in the event that they violate [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=82.56s)]
*  those fundamental understandings that they've now set forth. Which is one of the reasons why [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=87.6s)]
*  a lot of people believe that the only way to really end the Hezbollah conflict and to end [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  the Hamas conflict as well is to seriously put the screws to Iran and the regime there and Tehran. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=96.0s)]
*  What do you think President Trump will do on that front when he takes office on the 20th? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=102.56s)]
*  John, I don't want to predict exactly what he'll do, but I know what we did. And there's no reason [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  to think that those same set of policies won't be implemented. They worked. Hezbollah was more [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=114.4s)]
*  broke. They had less money. Hamas didn't invade Israel on our watch. Iran was on its back foot. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  It was almost broke by the time we left office in January of 2021. And our partners in the region [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=127.28s)]
*  trusted us. The Israelis trusted that the United States would be with them. Our partners in the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=133.52s)]
*  Emirates and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia knew that we understood they were a force for good, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=137.92000000000002s)]
*  and they were working against Iran and on behalf of their own people and as an ally of the United [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=142.88s)]
*  States trying to deliver peace in the region. That's what became the Abraham Accords. I think that [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  model will be the one that President Trump and his team ought to pursue. And I'm confident that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=152.64s)]
*  the team that he's building will do that with great excellence. One of the three principles for [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=157.12s)]
*  the ceasefire deal with Hezbollah that the Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu laid out was to separate [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=161.44s)]
*  Hezbollah from Hamas and really isolate what's left of the Hamas leadership in Gaza. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=166.64s)]
*  Already Hamas is saying, well, maybe we should get back to the table here and talk about a [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=173.11999999999998s)]
*  ceasefire. I would assume that any ceasefire with Hamas is going to be very favorable to Israel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  I'm going to guess that the Israelis wouldn't sign it if it wasn't. Frankly, John, foremost [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=185.83999999999997s)]
*  amongst that is to get back those hostages. We shouldn't forget as we approach Thanksgiving [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=190.32s)]
*  here in the United States that there are still Americans held hostage in Gaza being held by the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=194.96s)]
*  Iranians through their proxy Hamas. I hope that they'll get to a peace agreement, but it has to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  be one that is more than just a ceasefire. It has to actually deliver a structure which can provide [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=205.36s)]
*  certainty for the nation of Israel and for the United States that this conflict won't rise again. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=211.60000000000002s)]
*  And the fact that we're talking about this after the election, when President Trump is about to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=216.08s)]
*  take office, it shouldn't surprise anyone. I want to ask you about one other issue, and that is the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=220.4s)]
*  appearance of drones, a number of them over bases in the UK, which also house U.S. military forces, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  drones that one senior U.S. official said, quote, the drones do not appear to be those of hobbyists. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=233.36s)]
*  This follows drones appearing over Langley Air Force Base in Eastern Virginia, the Norfolk Naval [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=239.28s)]
*  Station in Virginia as well. Any idea who or what is behind this? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=243.44s)]
*  I've seen this reporting. I couldn't tell you who, but I am confident it is an adversary force. That [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=251.04s)]
*  is, this isn't just some, to your point, they call it a hobbyist. This isn't someone just checking [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=257.84s)]
*  things out and playing around to see if they can make their little remotely pilot aircraft do its [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=262.4s)]
*  function. I am sure that there are nefarious actors behind this. I couldn't tell you which ones [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=267.12s)]
*  we need to get to the bottom of it. Not only do the Brits need to do that in the United Kingdom, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=272.0s)]
*  but we've had this. Don't forget, we had a Chinese spy balloon that flew over the country for a while [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=275.76s)]
*  just a couple years back. It seems like a long time ago. But these are serious incidents. These [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=280.24s)]
*  are putting at risk our soldiers, our sailors, our airmen and Marines, and we need to get to the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=285.6s)]
*  bottom of it. It's very unlikely that some random person would just be flying these things around [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=290.08s)]
*  significant and serious British and U.S. security facilities and that there have been no repercussions [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=296.32s)]
*  only increases my view that it is likely a bad actor. Quickly, before we leave, Mr. Secretary, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  I wanted to get your quick reaction to Keith Kellogg being named as a special envoy for Ukraine [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=309.12s)]
*  and Russia. He is going to likely be tasked with what some Ukrainian generals are already referring [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=313.68s)]
*  to as World War III and putting an end to it. Tough task, but a man quintessentially suited to [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=319.92s)]
*  work on this. I had the chance to work alongside Keith when he was working at the White House and [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=329.04s)]
*  with the vice president as the then vice president's national security advisor. I've gotten to know Keith [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=333.92s)]
*  well. I am confident that he is thinking about this problem in exactly the right way. He understands [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=338.64s)]
*  President Trump's mission, which is to create the conditions for successful peace in the region, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=343.68s)]
*  and I wish Keith all the best as he moves through what will be a very complicated, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=349.12s)]
*  very difficult challenge, but one that I wish the Biden administration had taken with sufficient [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=352.24s)]
*  seriousness to impose real costs on Russia. So the outcome for the West, for Europe, for the United [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=357.04s)]
*  States, and for the people of Ukraine, we're not the one that we've suffered these last, now, goodness, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=363.52s)]
*  almost three years. Mr. Secretary, good to have you with us today. Happy Thanksgiving to you and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=368.72s)]
*  your family. Thank you, John. Happy Thanksgiving. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1WQSVFk7C0&t=373.52s)]
