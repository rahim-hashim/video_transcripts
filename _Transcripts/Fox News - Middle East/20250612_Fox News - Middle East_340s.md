# Iran's chilling warning to Israel: 'HARSH PUNISHMENT'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ)
*  Sheila Nazarian, to you, it is interesting when you talk about the fact that there is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  an effort possibly underway to win hearts and minds in Iran, in the home country of [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=4.64s)]
*  your parents. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=9.46s)]
*  I don't think you need to win the hearts and minds of the Iranian people. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=10.46s)]
*  One of my friends whose mother lives in Iran, she called him and said, tell Mr. Trump we're [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=13.46s)]
*  ready for his bombs. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  The people of Iran want to be set free. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=18.14s)]
*  But I do want to comment a little bit about negotiations and having talks with Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  Every person in the U.S. and elsewhere that is of Iranian descent understands this government [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=25.54s)]
*  will shake your hand in diplomacy with their right hand and will be enriching uranium in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=30.4s)]
*  secret with their left hand. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=35.1s)]
*  This democratic, the Democrats thinking that the Iranians believe what we believe and think [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=38.34s)]
*  the way Americans believe is naive and it's narcissistic. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=45.14s)]
*  The Iranians do not understand negotiation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=48.64s)]
*  They see it as a weakness. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  They love to talk. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=54.0s)]
*  They love these delays. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=55.04s)]
*  And meanwhile, they're continuing to enrich uranium. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=56.44s)]
*  The only language this Iranian regime understands is force. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=59.08s)]
*  It is the only language they respect and they will listen to. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=63.42s)]
*  An overwhelming power like what Israel did tonight is the only way to achieve peace in [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=66.74s)]
*  that region. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=73.12s)]
*  And I want to say one more thing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=74.53999999999999s)]
*  Iran is not Iraq. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=76.03999999999999s)]
*  The American people look at Iraq and they say we got rid of Saddam Hussein and somebody [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=77.82s)]
*  worse came in. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=82.1s)]
*  Maybe the people of Iraq are not ready for democracy. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=83.17999999999999s)]
*  The people of Iran are ready for democracy and they're hungry for it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=86.08s)]
*  And I hope that the weakening of this regime in Iran by what Israel has done tonight will [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=90.44s)]
*  allow them to rise up and take the beautiful country back. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  We are blessed to have both rabbis, Mence and Cooper with us tonight. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=98.83999999999999s)]
*  Rabbi Cooper, it's kind of when you hear Sheila Nazarian, it's interesting when you look at [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=102.08s)]
*  the political chessboard in the Middle East, there are all kinds of scenarios and one right [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=107.42s)]
*  now wonders which one the Israelis are actually going for. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=114.66000000000001s)]
*  I don't think that the Israelis know exactly where the bottle is looking to stop spinning. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=118.66000000000001s)]
*  I just came back from Syria where I met with the president of Syria early this week, the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=123.86000000000001s)]
*  new president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=128.14000000000001s)]
*  And there's an acknowledgement among the Syrian people that it was the Israelis defeating [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=129.58s)]
*  and pummeling Hezbollah and the Iranian missiles that opened the gates wide open for this new [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=134.48s)]
*  regime. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=141.48s)]
*  There's no question that across the region Arab leaders and I think many people in the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=142.48s)]
*  Arab streets are hoping that Israel will finish the job so that everyone can get on with the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=148.2s)]
*  rest of their lives and pursue a more positive life for themselves. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=154.84s)]
*  As for the Israelis, this is an existential threat and you know Trace, I'm listening very [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=160.86s)]
*  carefully to all the experts. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=165.86s)]
*  I spoke to my two daughters who live in Jerusalem at 3.30 in the morning Jerusalem time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=167.82s)]
*  You know there are eight grandchildren, there's a great grandson, you know that first alarm [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=173.82s)]
*  went off a kind of here's what you have to get used to. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=179.42000000000002s)]
*  This is real on the human level, it's very, very tough. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=183.52s)]
*  The Israelis are incredibly resilient but they're still human. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=187.5s)]
*  So if Bibi went all the way on this, it's because he and the establishment felt there [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=191.44s)]
*  was no other choice. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=197.88s)]
*  And as Aaron mentioned before, they've been anticipating this moment for years. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=199.44s)]
*  Rabbi Mutz? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=205.44s)]
*  Alright, I got three things to tell you, to talk about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=206.92000000000002s)]
*  One, what's this, by the way, that what you're looking at is nighttime Jerusalem, this is [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=210.64s)]
*  old film, this is not going on right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=215.16s)]
*  It's pretty safe. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=217.82s)]
*  Yeah, from a few hours ago, you're exactly right, go ahead. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=218.82s)]
*  Alright, why do we say that Israel has to go back to negotiations with Iran? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=221.02s)]
*  I don't hear anybody saying, Russia, we gotta put pressure on Russia and Ukraine. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=224.9s)]
*  No, Israel's finally doing something right. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=228.85999999999999s)]
*  Oh, we gotta go and get Israel back to the, stop it, stop it, stop being an hypocrite. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=231.82s)]
*  Second thing, Jennifer Griffiths spoke about the proxies can attack. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=237.26s)]
*  We have 1800 marches coming in this country as a rebellion against the democracy of our [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=242.02s)]
*  president. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  You have no idea what one loan sold, what one proxy can do. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=251.10000000000002s)]
*  America, wake up, these people are coming after you. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=254.88s)]
*  God bless us, nothing will happen. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=258.24s)]
*  Last but not least, Tim Kaine, seriously? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=260.76s)]
*  The reason why Israel attacked, he doesn't get it. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=263.8s)]
*  Like Sheila said, are you kidding me? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=266.72s)]
*  They played a game. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  As we say in Yiddish, they schlep, they drag it out. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=271.73999999999995s)]
*  They get the missiles, they get the bombs, and then they go, we're out of negotiations. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=275.82s)]
*  No. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=280.46s)]
*  Now is the time, get it done. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=281.46s)]
*  This is good for the world. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=284.15999999999997s)]

*  I just want to put in this breaking news. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  Reuters reporting Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Israel will receive harsh [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=289.14s)]
*  punishment that's in quotes following an attack on Friday targeting Iran's nuclear program [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=294.73999999999995s)]
*  and killing several military commanders. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=299.96s)]
*  The Zionist regime, Israel, unleashed its wicked and bloody hand in a crime against Iran this [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=302.36s)]
*  morning and revealed its vile nature with this attack. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=308.24s)]
*  The Zionist regime has prepared a bitter fate for itself, which it will definitely receive, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=312.08s)]
*  Khamenei said in this statement to Reuters. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FujnH2NOOZQ&t=318.04s)]
