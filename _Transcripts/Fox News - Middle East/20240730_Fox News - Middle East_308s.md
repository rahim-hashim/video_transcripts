# Iran working to influence US elections to keep Trump out of office: US intel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=0.0s)]
*  The State Department is warning Americans to flee Lebanon as the conflict escalates [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=3.12s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=8.16s)]
*  When we're talking about the safety and security of the American citizens and especially American [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=9.76s)]
*  citizens living in the region, as it relates to the whole country, that continues to be [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=14.64s)]
*  a level three for reconsidered travel and for southern Lebanon that continues to be [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=18.56s)]
*  a level four for do not travel. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=23.28s)]
*  And that is because what we're talking about is safety. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=24.96s)]
*  And right now, yes, the safe thing for American citizens to do would be to make appropriate [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=28.36s)]
*  plans. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=34.68s)]
*  I misspoke. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=35.68s)]
*  I meant Hezbollah when I said Hamas. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=36.68s)]
*  But regardless, Dan Hoffman is a former CIA station chief who served in Moscow, Iraq and [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=38.08s)]
*  Pakistan is a Fox News contributor and joins me now. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=42.4s)]
*  Dan, Israel is vowing swift and harsh revenge, but the Biden administration, the Biden Harris [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=45.96s)]
*  administration is cautioning Israel not to retaliate and not to get to escalatory. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=52.84s)]
*  What do you make of the Biden Harris administration trying to tie Israel's hands on yet a second [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=60.28s)]
*  front in this war for their existence? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=64.64s)]
*  Well, Israel and Hezbollah have been trading cross-border attacks since the war in Gaza [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=68.4s)]
*  began. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=75.12s)]
*  And if Israel doesn't respond, then they lose deterrence. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And look, 60,000 Israelis have been forced to flee their homes in northern Israel. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=81.04s)]
*  For that matter, 100,000 Lebanese have had to leave southern Lebanon. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=86.2s)]
*  And so it's really for all practical purposes a war zone. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=89.84s)]
*  But Israel needs to respond. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=93.2s)]
*  Otherwise, Hezbollah will ratchet up the attacks that they've been launching against Israel [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=95.0s)]
*  and gain the benefit in doing so. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=99.2s)]
*  Do you see this weekend's attack as an instigator of a broad regional conflict? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=101.2s)]
*  And what could that mean for the U.S.? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=106.66000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think we're in a broad regional conflict. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=110.72s)]
*  And if you look at the extent to which Iran's proxy Houthi terrorists have disrupted the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=113.0s)]
*  commerce and freedom of navigation in the Red Sea, they launched a drone in Haifa, in [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=119.96s)]
*  Israel, and the Israelis in Tel Aviv, I should say. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=126.84s)]
*  And Israel responded by launching a reciprocal attack on Yemen's port of Hudaydah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=129.51999999999998s)]
*  Again, that's Israel seeking to restore escalation dominance. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=136.16s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing right now in the Middle East. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  I wish I could say that things looked better, but we've got a nuclear threshold Iran supporting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=142.84s)]
*  these proxy terrorists and the war in Gaza with Israel trying to round up Hamas fighters [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  and eliminate their capability to launch future terrorist attacks. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  And it's a very dicey situation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=158.74s)]
*  We all know Iran is at the center of this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=161.58s)]
*  We're also at the center of something happening here in our country. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=163.52s)]
*  U.S. Intel agencies warning that Iran is trying to influence our election to keep Trump from [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=167.16s)]
*  winning. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=172.88s)]
*  Here's part of what was learned at an unclassified briefing. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=173.88s)]
*  Quote, the IC has observed Tehran working to influence the presidential election, probably [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=176.24s)]
*  because Iranian leaders want to avoid an outcome they perceive would increase the tensions [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=180.84s)]
*  with the U.S. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=185.08s)]
*  Tehran relies on vast webs of online personas and propaganda mills to spread disinformation [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=186.08s)]
*  and have been notably active in exacerbating tensions over the Israel-Gaza conflict. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=192.12s)]
*  What anti-Trump tactics, Dan, and information should the average American be on guard for [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  coming out of Iran? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=204.08s)]
*  First of all, it's important to remember that Iran has played a role in our information [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=208.12s)]
*  space since the war in Gaza began, an increased role where they have been seeking to put out [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=212.04000000000002s)]
*  lines in favor of Hamas and have even been reportedly, according to the director of national [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=218.5s)]
*  intelligence, funding some of the protests that were taking place in the United States [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=225.5s)]
*  and seeking to sow division in our country. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=230.62s)]
*  So look, Americans need to look at their news very carefully. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=233.62s)]
*  Look at the source of the news. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=237.54s)]
*  That's important. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=238.9s)]
*  And on the ground, I've always said if you see something, say something. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=240.46s)]
*  The Iranians aren't just interested in the public relations and propaganda and disinformation. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=244.57999999999998s)]
*  They're also a terrorist state, and they are seeking to launch terrorist attacks worldwide. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=250.73999999999998s)]
*  And certainly, I wouldn't put it past them in the United States. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  Remember that it was during the Trump administration that we took out Iran's IRGC, Iran Revolutionary [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=259.82s)]
*  Guard Corps, Commander Qasem Soleimani in January of 2020. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=266.02s)]
*  And there's no doubt that the Iranians would like to get revenge for that. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=271.6s)]
*  They've been trying for a while. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=274.5s)]
*  There's also the matter of do we trust the Biden-Harris administration to fully go after [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=275.7s)]
*  Iran in this endeavor, one, because they've demonstrated sort of a reception or receptiveness [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=280.86s)]
*  to Iran, but also this ultimately hurts their primary opponent. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  You have to ask the question, are they going to go full bore after the Iranians in this [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=290.14000000000004s)]
*  capacity? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S16k1wau84o&t=293.90000000000003s)]
