# US at greatest risk of an attack today in its history: Rep. Wilson
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg)
*  The United States says it will send a second carrier strike group to the Eastern Mediterranean [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=0.0s)]
*  as Israeli forces prepare their ground offensive in Gaza. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=4.2s)]
*  For more on the U.S. response, we are joined by Republican congressman from South Carolina [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  and a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Joe Wilson. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=11.6s)]
*  Congressman, thank you for joining us this afternoon. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=14.6s)]
*  The U.S. has already delivered shipments to Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=17.76s)]
*  They're continuing to be delivered to the country. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=20.48s)]
*  How much time do you think the U.S. has before there's going to need to be a congressional [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=25.060000000000002s)]
*  appropriation here and additional money to help Israel? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  Well, actually, we have the funding in place, and it should be movement of funds without [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=33.64s)]
*  any delay at all. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=40.64s)]
*  And I agree very much with Senator Tom Cotton, and that is despite him being a Harvard graduate, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=43.24s)]
*  he is very correct that everything's on the table to promote peace through strength. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=49.28s)]
*  We've got plenty of intelligence coming from the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=56.24s)]
*  saying that Iran was involved very specifically in the details of this attack for years trying [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=61.56s)]
*  to plan it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=68.0s)]
*  What we've heard from the administration is that Iran has generally supported Hamas throughout [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=69.0s)]
*  its existence, but refuses to say or go that far and say that there has been that specific [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  level of planning. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=81.14s)]
*  From what you've seen, what involvement did Iran have specifically in this attack? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=83.2s)]
*  Hey, Rich, we need to be real, and we need to be clear to the American people. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=89.72s)]
*  Hezbollah, Hamas truly is Iran. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=95.48s)]
*  It is Ra'esi. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=100.12s)]
*  They do believe in death to Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=101.46000000000001s)]
*  They are working on that now, killing all Jewish people, not just the people of Israel, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=104.2s)]
*  and death to America. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=109.58s)]
*  Then, sadly, we can see the collusion and approval by war criminal Putin. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=111.34s)]
*  Hamas has sent its emissaries there in March. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=116.3s)]
*  They had emissaries there in September. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=119.94s)]
*  They actually conducted the invasion on Putin's birthday. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=124.26s)]
*  There's such collusion of the dictators around the world, and we need to be prepared to stop it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=128.46s)]
*  I want to talk about that China angle here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=133.78s)]
*  This was reported in Axios earlier today. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=135.66s)]
*  It's essentially saying that by not condemning Hamas specifically, that China is looking [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=137.9s)]
*  to score points with the Arab countries. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=143.98000000000002s)]
*  That's an analysis that was featured earlier today in Axios. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=147.3s)]
*  Do you think that's an accurate portrayal? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=150.76s)]
*  What about the China angle here? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=152.32s)]
*  It's an axis of dictators of Putin, Xi, Ra'esi. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=155.36s)]
*  Actually, to me, the actions of Iran, we know Iran has tried to assassinate different officials [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=161.38s)]
*  of Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=169.02s)]
*  They've launched missiles against UAE. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=170.66s)]
*  Actually, the best thing that can occur for our long-time Arab allies is that Iran no [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=174.74s)]
*  longer have the capacity to destabilize the Middle East. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=183.06s)]
*  We need to restore the relationships that we've had with Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=187.72s)]
*  I just a couple of weeks ago was in Riyadh. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=191.20000000000002s)]
*  I've been visiting with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Jerusalem. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=193.36s)]
*  I was in Turkey, Turkey, a member of NATO. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  We've got to restore our relationships with the countries that are so meaningful to have [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=201.0s)]
*  stability, which is so helpful to them and to the United States and to the civilized world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  And just very quickly, what about the domestic threat to the United States here and violence [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=213.16s)]
*  within the U.S., the possibility of it? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=216.88s)]
*  Well, Rich, I over 110 times on the House floor have warned that the global war on terrorism [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=218.88s)]
*  is not over, that it's actually moving from the appeasement in Afghanistan to come to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  America to affect American families. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=231.0s)]
*  We've never been at greater risk of an imminent attack than we are today in the history of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  our country. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=239.4s)]
*  Congressman, thanks so much for joining us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c9pEmby6nOg&t=240.4s)]
