# 'USELESS': Ret. Brig. Gen. Spalding says Biden's strikes in Syria will not deter Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA)
*  Want to go to Brigadier General Rob Spaulding right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=0.0s)]
*  His take on all of this, war without rules is his latest, it makes you think about where [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=4.48s)]
*  we stand. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=8.64s)]
*  Now, General, let me ask you a little bit about these attacks on U.S. soldiers, are [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=9.64s)]
*  beefing up the number boots on the ground, 900 more troops. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=14.06s)]
*  Now, this does appear to be very much an escalating conflict. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=17.96s)]
*  Can you think it stay that way or be contained? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=22.56s)]
*  Well, I guess as long as we're not going after who's starting it, which is really Iran, I [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=26.8s)]
*  mean, I cannot believe that we think that we're going to deter Iran by hitting proxies [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  in Syria. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  They're just going to continue to further up the ante. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  We, you know, if you go back to when we bombed General Qasseem Soleimani, they got the message [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=44.72s)]
*  really fast. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=51.24s)]
*  And so you're going to have to go after Iran if you want to de-escalate the situation. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=52.24s)]
*  You can't basically expect that they really care about you hitting their proxies. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=56.28s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=60.96s)]
*  But we seem to care about hitting Iran directly. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=61.96s)]
*  I can understand some of those concerns. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=66.08s)]
*  But Israel is clearly agitated to the point of wanting to take action itself against Iran. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=69.84s)]
*  How likely is that? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=76.42s)]
*  Well, probably very likely if this continues. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=78.52000000000001s)]
*  And I think I would not blame them. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  Quite frankly, I cannot fathom why we wouldn't go after Iran, you know, particularly as a [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=84.36s)]
*  message to say stop. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=90.6s)]
*  And the only way that you're going to give them that message is if you threaten directly [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  the Iranian leadership. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=97.88s)]
*  They will not respond to this type of proxy attack. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=99.52s)]
*  This is going to be a useless effort that doesn't really stop them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  You know, again, go back to General Qasseem Soleimani. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=108.11999999999999s)]
*  They got the message right away and de-escalated. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=112.24s)]
*  So if you want to de-escalate, you have to go after the Iranian leadership in a real [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=115.8s)]
*  way. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=120.11999999999999s)]
*  Make them feel threatened. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=121.11999999999999s)]
*  Let me ask you, it's an insular issue, but it was one I did want to raise with you. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=122.11999999999999s)]
*  A lot of federal government officials here in this country, General, have been talking [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=129.4s)]
*  about crypto firms not helping terrorists out. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  But there must be more financial transparency. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=140.2s)]
*  They're looking at funding for terrorist groups. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=142.56s)]
*  We know that this Hamas attack back on October 7th was largely financed through untraceable [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=144.28s)]
*  crypto funds. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=151.32s)]
*  What do you make of that and what we can do to stop that, if we can stop that? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=153.48s)]
*  Well, I'm going to just go ahead and say, and people are going to be unhappy with this, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=159.23999999999998s)]
*  I'm not a fan of crypto in terms of national sovereignty. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  I think the only one that should be coining currency in the country is the federal government. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=167.56s)]
*  It's how we maintain our federal republic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  I understand kind of the novelty or the other nature of using a distributed currency, but [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=176.68s)]
*  ultimately it's going to be used by people that want to keep off the radar, which means [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=182.84s)]
*  it's going to facilitate terrorism and criminal behavior. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=187.72s)]
*  General, do you think Hamas appreciated the magnitude of the response it's seeing now, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=191.12s)]
*  the ten-hundred-fold response on the part of Israel, our actions against these surrogates [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=196.2s)]
*  acting on Iran's behalf, Saudi Arabia then knocking down a Houthi rebel missile coming [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=202.04s)]
*  from Yemen? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  They're distinct and different, I grant you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  But it does make you wonder about the wisdom or their strategy then, unless they were envisioning [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  this would create a global jihad. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=218.6s)]
*  Of course, Khomeini himself thought that was something that would happen after 9-11 and it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=221.28s)]
*  did not. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=227.04s)]
*  So I'm just wondering what you make of it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=227.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'll take you back to the beginning of your broadcast where you talked about who's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=231.68s)]
*  benefiting from this, and that's Putin. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=234.72s)]
*  Through their relationship, so is China. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=238.72s)]
*  So this is part of a broader effort. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=240.72s)]
*  It's the second Cold War. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=243.04s)]
*  This is expanding. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=245.12s)]
*  It will expand into Asia next. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=246.64s)]
*  And the idea here is to overwhelm and eventually bankrupt the United States, the same as we [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=248.96s)]
*  eventually did to the Soviet Union. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=254.07999999999998s)]
*  So we've been taking a very bad approach to this, and quite frankly, we need to reassess, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=255.76s)]
*  understand the global situation, and prepare for a long fight. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=261.52s)]
*  You know, General, a lot has been said and second-guessed about the wisdom of Hamas's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=266.32s)]
*  early attacks and what the upside could be to the butchery and just the audacity of it. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=271.44s)]
*  And that there now is concern that they're in for a major beating, but they're then trying [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=278.16s)]
*  to attach that to building global sympathy for whatever Israel launches in Gaza. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=284.72s)]
*  How does Israel, how does the Western world respond to that? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=292.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, it's difficult because now Hamas is essentially getting exactly what they wanted, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=297.6s)]
*  which is, you know, 24-7 coverage. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=303.36s)]
*  And this is basically the goal. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=306.48s)]
*  The goal was not so much the attack. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=309.44s)]
*  It's the aftermath and the outcome and the propaganda value of what happens. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=311.76s)]
*  And so they're going to—they really want this attack to come on. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  And it seems counterintuitive. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  Who would want this type of invasion to happen to them? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=322.64000000000004s)]
*  But Hamas doesn't care about the people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=325.92s)]
*  They only care about the propaganda value that happens when those people are killed and injured. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=328.16s)]
*  Unfortunately. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=336.64000000000004s)]
*  General, I'm sorry to jump on you there, sir. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  Your former B-2 stealth bomber pilot, though you know of what you speak when it comes to, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=339.68s)]
*  you know, close encounters. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  You heard about this other B-52 that came within, or Chinese aircraft that came within 10 feet of it. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=345.44s)]
*  And I'm just wondering, I mean, in the middle of all of this, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  China is being provocative as all get at. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  Well, they really are. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=360.72s)]
*  And what you're seeing is—so their strategy, really, if you look at it, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=361.59999999999997s)]
*  they talk about it all the time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=366.64s)]
*  It's we need four distractors for the United States. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=368.4s)]
*  That is Russia. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=372.24s)]
*  That is Iran. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  That is North Korea. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=374.4s)]
*  And the fourth is terrorism. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=375.44s)]
*  So they see this as a strategy to keep us overwhelmed and distracted while they pursue [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=377.12s)]
*  their efforts militarily in their region, but also globally in terms of influence. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=383.84s)]
*  So they're trying to create a world where most of the world doesn't believe or respect [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=389.6s)]
*  the United States. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=396.56s)]
*  And this is a very effective way to go about it because, quite frankly, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  our military is getting overwhelmed at the moment. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's going to get even worse as this war escalates in the Middle East and spreads to Asia. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  And as you predicted, only a couple of weeks ago, when we were last chatting, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=409.36s)]
*  General, I want to thank you very much and more so for your [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=413.12s)]
*  credible service to this country. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=416.0s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=417.52000000000004s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9CIuxvVeeRA&t=418.4s)]
