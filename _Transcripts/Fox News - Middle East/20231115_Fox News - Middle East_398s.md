# NEW FOOTAGE: IDF blows up Hamas tunnel near hospital
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A)
*  So we have just received this brand new video from the front lines of the fight in Israel's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=0.0s)]
*  Gaza offensive as IDF troops blow up an entrance to one of the uncovered Hamas terror tunnels [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=8.620000000000001s)]
*  very close to Al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=18.8s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=22.580000000000002s)]
*  So all of this video that you're seeing and you're going to see more of it in a moment [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=25.58s)]
*  is coming into us from Fox News contributor Douglas Murray who was on the front lines [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=34.86s)]
*  with the IDF today during their targeted operation at the Al-Shifa hospital where weapons and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=40.54s)]
*  other technology you can see these videos because remember this is part of the that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=48.34s)]
*  they have to have evidence that the headquarters for Hamas and their weaponry is underneath [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=53.42s)]
*  and in in some cases this hospital. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=60.54s)]
*  So this is the video that you're seeing that they are showing to prove that indeed that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=62.980000000000004s)]
*  is the relationship between Hamas and the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=68.38s)]
*  Douglas Murray joins me now from Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=72.38s)]
*  He is also a National Review Institute fellow. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=73.9s)]
*  Douglas, good to have you with us today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=77.14s)]
*  How did your trip into Gaza come together today? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=78.94s)]
*  Well, as often with these things, pretty short notice from the military authorities gave [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=83.98s)]
*  a few journalists about an hour. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=92.06s)]
*  We'd been on waiting for some days to see if we could go into the Gaza with the IDF. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=95.30000000000001s)]
*  Obviously, the Gaza is where most of the military operation in Israel is happening at the moment. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=100.22s)]
*  There are some skirmishes in the north that have been rockets fired in the south, Tel [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=105.42s)]
*  Aviv where I am tonight. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=108.86s)]
*  The West days has alarms and the sirens go and we all have to go to shelters. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=110.94s)]
*  But it's Gaza where the real fighting is going on. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=117.89999999999999s)]
*  So yes, I entered through the gate that the 7th of October terrorists actually broke through [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=122.58s)]
*  that day to carry out their massacre of 1400 Israelis. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=130.26s)]
*  We went through the other way, through the same entrance with the IDF vehicles. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=136.1s)]
*  We stopped at a nearby village where there'd be some massive fighting and a lot of destruction [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=143.5s)]
*  clearly, which is exactly where the footage you're showing at the moment was shot. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=148.86s)]
*  We were shown, the IDF had just discovered a new tunnel that connects to this extraordinary [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=154.9s)]
*  massive underground terror tunnel network that the Hamas have built. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=160.06s)]
*  And there are so many casualties that come from opening these up. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=165.38000000000002s)]
*  Just a few days ago, several young IDF soldiers were killed by going, opening up one of these [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=169.38s)]
*  tunnels and it was booby trapped and everyone was killed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  So today they were taking no chances, as you can see on the screen at the moment, experts [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=180.38s)]
*  from the IDF put dynamite down the shaft and we all got around the corner and they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=186.14s)]
*  detonated it and you could feel the ground underneath you shaking as they did so. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=192.82s)]
*  This is just part of the tunnel network, which of course for the Israelis is of particular [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=197.89999999999998s)]
*  importance because first of all, Hamas fighters are hiding in them and can break out at any [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=202.94s)]
*  moment. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=207.33999999999997s)]
*  But secondly, and this is a much more troubling issue really, the Israelis do believe that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=208.33999999999997s)]
*  this massive tunnel network under Gaza is likely to be where the remaining surviving [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=213.85999999999999s)]
*  240 kidnapped Israelis may well be being kept at the moment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=219.9s)]
*  Yes, two questions come to mind, Douglas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=225.9s)]
*  One is, did they talk to you at all about the concern about hostages as they're doing [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  this work? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=235.18s)]
*  The other issue is confirmation of the Hamas operation underneath the hospital. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=237.34s)]
*  The White House came out today, John Kirby basically saying that they are comfortable [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=245.18s)]
*  with their intel assessment about the degree to which Hamas is and was using Al-Shifa as [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=248.94s)]
*  a command and control mode. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=255.94s)]
*  What did you learn about those two issues? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=258.26s)]
*  First of all, I mean, a group like Amnesty International, which is by no means a pro-Israel [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=261.58000000000004s)]
*  group, by no means. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=268.26000000000005s)]
*  In 2014, said that the Al-Shifa hospital was being used by Hamas as a torture chamber, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=270.58000000000004s)]
*  as a place to store weaponry, as a place where executions were taking place of Palestinians [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=278.06s)]
*  who weren't completely in line with Hamas or in some ways suspect in the eyes of Hamas. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  So this has been known for a very long time. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=290.18s)]
*  There's something very perverse about certain parts of the media and some governments in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=292.14s)]
*  recent days denying something that really pretty anti-Israel NGOs like Amnesty were [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=297.86s)]
*  admitting years ago. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=303.86s)]
*  So that's the first thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=306.58s)]
*  The second thing is, of course, the Israelis are very concerned about the hostages. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=307.58s)]
*  It's one of their absolutely prime issues. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=311.02s)]
*  I was at one of the humanitarian crossings in Gaza earlier today, right in the center [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=315.14s)]
*  of Gaza, where you see the population moving every day from north to south on the advice [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=319.98s)]
*  of the Israeli military, requesting that Gazans get out of the main military action, which [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=325.42s)]
*  is going on all around you as you're in the Gaza in the north. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=330.26s)]
*  And among other things, you can see the photos there was very moving. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=335.26s)]
*  I mean, of course, all these Palestinians are leaving their homes. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=338.1s)]
*  They're leaving their homes because the IDF wants to make sure that the firefight is between [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=341.74s)]
*  them and Hamas. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=346.02s)]
*  But among other things, very quickly, there was a request in Hebrew whilst I was there [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=347.26s)]
*  across the loudspeakers from the IDF saying any child who understands Hebrew jump up now [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=351.26s)]
*  because they believe the hostages, including the children, may well be being taken south. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=357.46s)]
*  Incredible, incredible images, Douglas. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=362.42s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us, Douglas Murray, as the war continues on in full force [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=365.53999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza after the killing on October 7th by Hamas. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=salrDP0LD-A&t=371.7s)]
