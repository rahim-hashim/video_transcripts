*  So right now as the Middle East boils over, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=0.0s)]
*  everyone's asking the same question. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=4.2s)]
*  What do you call it when you raise a flagpole? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=6.9s)]
*  A lifting? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=9.82s)]
*  They call it a lifting. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=10.84s)]
*  They also use another word, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  but I'm not gonna use that word. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=13.74s)]
*  You know what that is? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=14.86s)]
*  The word, it starts with an E. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=16.34s)]
*  You know what the word is? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  If I ever used it, I'd be run out of town. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=20.42s)]
*  We don't deserve him. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=23.42s)]
*  We don't deserve him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXn0rfnz6ZI&t=25.580000000000002s)]
