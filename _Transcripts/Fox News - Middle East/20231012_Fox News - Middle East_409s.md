# Tim Kennedy: This is something very different
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU)
*  22 minutes before the top of the hour, you're looking live at Gaza City after Israeli military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=0.0s)]
*  strikes all morning long, morning hour morning there afternoon. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=5.62s)]
*  You see the smoke, huge smoke clouds on your screen right. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=9.08s)]
*  Now Secretary of State Blinken just met with the Prime Minister as more than 1,200 innocent [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=12.36s)]
*  Israeli victims have been named as well as 25 Americans have been murdered by Hamas. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=17.12s)]
*  President Biden was absolutely correct in calling this sheer evil. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=25.08s)]
*  Hamas is ISIS and just as ISIS was crushed, so too will Hamas be crushed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=32.48s)]
*  Hamas has only one agenda, to destroy Israel and to murder Jews. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=40.12s)]
*  No country can or would tolerate the slaughter of its citizens or simply return to the conditions [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=47.16s)]
*  that allowed it to take place. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Officials now are trying to figure out if low tech strategies were actually the ones [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=55.68s)]
*  used to evade Israel's elite intel agencies. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Retired Army Ranger, sniper and special forces operator Tim Kennedy joins us now, who's also [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=62.72s)]
*  doing his best to get people out of Israel safely because they have very little, very [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=67.46s)]
*  few options. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=72.42s)]
*  Looking at it right now Tim, how do you think they were able to pull this off against Israel? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=74.12s)]
*  In most Ukraine what we've learned is that the low tech option is really the only dependable [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  option. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  You know, there has been such a dependence on technology. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  Technology doesn't work in war. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  What works in war is people on the ground doing violence and Hamas knew this and they [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=96.24000000000001s)]
*  were able to keep a very small circle, control the information, train people in silos. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  The people that were being trained had no idea what they were even going to go and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=107.08s)]
*  do but then once they got their mission orders they were prepared and they were trained and [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=110.48s)]
*  all they had to go and do was violence and they did the worst, most evil, unconscionable [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=115.48s)]
*  violence. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=120.64s)]
*  And that's a guy, I'm talking to a guy that's basically seen it all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=121.64s)]
*  Now Save Our Allies sprung into action. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=125.24s)]
*  You've already successfully assisted in getting a dozen people out of Israel and you're still [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=127.48s)]
*  working now to do the same thing. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=132.52s)]
*  What are the needs and what are you able to do? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=135.16s)]
*  The need is playing in boats. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=139.68s)]
*  Commercial flights have effectively been cancelled so us going and moving people from their safe [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=142.4s)]
*  houses, from their bunkers to airports to get them on commercial flights, to get them [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=148.04s)]
*  out back to any international airport have just been limited to almost nothing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  So now we are trying to find other options, private planes, boats. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=157.18s)]
*  So if there's anybody out there, Save Our Allies, we do need help. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=161.84s)]
*  We have, I can't say how many out of OPSEC or the routes that we're giving moving people [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=165.24s)]
*  but it is getting more dire by the day. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=170.28s)]
*  These people have seen horrific things and are just trying to get, these are American [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=172.28s)]
*  citizens that are trapped there and we need pressure on the Department of State to take [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=176.0s)]
*  action to start moving Americans out of this war zone because it is going to get worse. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=180.76s)]
*  Every time I talk to you, you're trying to do the right thing and the State Department [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  seems to be blocking you. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=191.08s)]
*  How frustrating is this? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=192.74s)]
*  I keep reliving, it's like I'm in deja vu of this worst nightmare over and over again, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=196.4s)]
*  whether it's Ukraine or Afghanistan or Sudan. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=201.32000000000002s)]
*  Let's not forget that China is on the door of Taiwan. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=207.32000000000002s)]
*  While all eyes are looking at Israel, we could have another international crisis that could [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=212.20000000000002s)]
*  kick off at any moment. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=215.8s)]
*  But this one with the Americans that are currently trapped there, we're not hamstrung, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=217.68s)]
*  we're still effectively working. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=222.56s)]
*  The amazing men and women on the ground, my heart is with you guys, I'm so proud to know [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=223.88s)]
*  you and thank you for everything that you're doing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=227.52s)]
*  But it is difficult to try to navigate the ever limited options and restricted options [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=229.68s)]
*  to get Americans out. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=236.4s)]
*  Now it's harder even to get private planes in. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=237.8s)]
*  Are they worried about the airport being less than protected? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=239.68s)]
*  We heard and it was false, Ben Gurion Airport was shelled but it wasn't. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=244.24s)]
*  Is that the problem? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=248.44s)]
*  They can't guarantee the safety of the airport? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=249.44s)]
*  Obviously, the commercial flights are not wanting to go in there because if you lose [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=252.08s)]
*  a plane, the insurance claims that go along with it, the pilots, the flight attendants, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=259.2s)]
*  there's so many considerations about bringing an international commercial flight in there. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=264.68s)]
*  The private flights even, from the Israeli government, they are restricting a lot of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=269.04s)]
*  flights in fear of knowing who, they want control right now and I understand that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=274.04s)]
*  They have to have control. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=279.64s)]
*  They're on the precipice of World War III in the region, the eradication of their state. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=281.24s)]
*  This was the worst single day death of Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=285.52s)]
*  And my heart is with them in the sense that they are trying to fight for their lives, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=289.88s)]
*  their very existence right now. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=295.48s)]
*  Even though we're trying to get Americans out, I also understand them trying to protect [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=297.55999999999995s)]
*  their own citizens. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=301.55999999999995s)]
*  Tim, I know you can fight back but you also have a big picture here. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=302.55999999999995s)]
*  You believe the goal with Hamas leaders is to get everybody in, to get Hezbollah in, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=306.2s)]
*  to get the Palestinian Authority in, get the terrorist ISIS in from Syria. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=312.55999999999995s)]
*  Is that the big picture goal? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=320.0s)]
*  Yeah, Brian, it's a great question. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=321.71999999999997s)]
*  Khalid Mashal, he's the leader of Hamas. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=324.88s)]
*  You can say anything you want about them. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=327.59999999999997s)]
*  They're evil, they're terrorists. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=329.0s)]
*  I wish they did not exist. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=330.4s)]
*  But what we do know is they're smart, they're not naive and they knew that there would be [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=332.64s)]
*  serious repercussions for an attack like this and that was the catalyst that they wanted. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=337.35999999999996s)]
*  They want Israel to respond violently and Israel has to because the things that happen [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=342.55999999999995s)]
*  to their citizens, you cannot just allow it to happen. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  But by doing that, that might be the catalyst that everybody else needs, Taliban, ISIS-K, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=350.28s)]
*  Hezbollah, for them to have their excuse to be united under Jihad to attack Israel. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=355.23999999999995s)]
*  So this is a very, very dangerous, it's a tinderbox there right now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=361.4s)]
*  It always is but this is something different. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=366.84s)]
*  This is one bomb away from everything going nuclear. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=369.23999999999995s)]
*  Would you be surprised if some of the weapons that we decided to leave in Afghanistan ended [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  up in with Hamas and with these terror groups? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=376.79999999999995s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=380.84s)]
*  I believe that they already were. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=382.24s)]
*  Seen some of the photos and videos, it looks like our equipment. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=385.12s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=389.44s)]
*  Tim Kennedy, while you were talking, there's been two strikes over here, you were splitting [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=390.44s)]
*  the screen with right in Gaza. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=394.08s)]
*  This is an active war and you're just trying to save people from it and we wish you could [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=395.98s)]
*  get more cooperation from the State Department and others. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=402.12s)]
*  Help out, save our allies, they're doing great work. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=405.48s)]
*  Thanks Tim. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3wvOV-x3VU&t=407.76s)]
