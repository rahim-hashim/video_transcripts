# Brian Kilmeade: There is no end in sight for Israel-Hamas war
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA)
*  The Israel Hamas war is picking into week five. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=0.0s)]

*  At this hour, the IDF is pushing deeper and deeper into Gaza [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=4.12s)]
*  as Israel amps up pressure on the terrorists [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]

*  so to speak, rejecting calls from them for a ceasefire [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=15.44s)]
*  or even a pause. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=18.68s)]
*  They says they'll make Hamas get time to regroup. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=20.16s)]
*  Doesn't want them to do that, neither do I. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  New tonight, another country turning on Israel, Turkey, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=25.64s)]
*  and the member of NATO for now, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=28.8s)]
*  joining a growing group of nations [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  pulling their ambassadors from Israel [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=32.480000000000004s)]

*  flooding cities around the world, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=39.88s)]
*  including our nation's capital, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=41.28s)]
*  many calling for violence against Jews and against Israel. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Right to rebel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=48.8s)]
*  It is right to rebel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  Israel can go to hell. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=52.72s)]
*  Israel can go to hell. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=55.0s)]
*  They are so clueless. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=57.92s)]
*  We have live team coverage now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=59.88s)]
*  Mike Emanuel is covering the protest in D.C., [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  but we begin with Alex Hogan, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  live in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=64.84s)]
*  Alex. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=66.72s)]
*  Hi, Brian, as we enter day 30 of the war, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=69.28s)]
*  the Defense Minister here in Israel issued a statement [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=71.84s)]
*  saying that forces will press on in northern Gaza, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=75.16s)]
*  whether that be for a month or a year. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  He urged those forces to continue to move forward. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=80.2s)]
*  He also sent a message to civilians in Gaza [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=83.48s)]
*  about the leader of Hamas. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=86.52s)]
*  The leadership of Hamas is responsible for this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=90.36s)]
*  We will get to Ihi Sinwar and we will eliminate him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=93.28s)]
*  I reiterate here to the residents of Gaza, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=96.52s)]
*  if you reach him before us, it will shorten the war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=98.88s)]
*  Hamas at the same time released this footage [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=104.19999999999999s)]
*  of what appears to be its fighters [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=106.92s)]
*  inside those intricate tunnel systems underground. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=108.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, the IDF on Saturday says [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=112.6s)]
*  that it blew up at least one of those tunnels. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=114.4s)]
*  Qatar's foreign ministry issued a warning on Saturday, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=117.0s)]
*  arguing that Israeli attacks on Gaza [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=120.72s)]
*  will only complicate efforts [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=122.92s)]
*  to mediate the release of hostages. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=124.48s)]
*  Hamas, shortly after that claim made the announcement, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=126.76s)]
*  it's saying that 60 of those 242 hostages [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  are missing after Israeli strikes. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=133.88s)]
*  Now, back here in Tel Aviv, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=136.20000000000002s)]
*  there were massive protests taking place Saturday night. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=137.36s)]
*  Those were protests held by the families [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=140.68s)]
*  of many of those hostages. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=142.88s)]
*  As far as what the US is saying about all of this, Brian, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=144.4s)]
*  US Secretary of State Antony Blinken did call for a pause [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  for humanitarian efforts, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=151.68s)]
*  while other countries, including Israel, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=153.51999999999998s)]
*  said that that is simply not on the table. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=155.64s)]
*  But Blinken did not say that he's calling for a ceasefire. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  To that specifically, he said that would only allow Hamas [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=160.92s)]
*  to regroup and attack again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=164.16s)]
*  Brian. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=166.48s)]
*  Alex, I'm just getting a report too over there [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=167.32s)]
*  saying where you are, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=170.16s)]
*  that Israel forces are expected to start conducting [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=171.52s)]
*  more missions to start to rescue hostages in Gaza City. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  I assume they're getting more and more intelligence [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=177.72s)]
*  the closer they get to the center, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  and they've surrounded, reportedly, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=182.4s)]
*  according to all our sources, Gaza City. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  Have you heard that too? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=187.04000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so we know that the IDF says [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=190.28s)]
*  it's completely surrounded the northern part of Gaza. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=192.28s)]
*  Again, they're focusing this effort [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=196.84s)]
*  not only by ground, land, and sea. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=198.60000000000002s)]
*  When we've been along the border, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  we're able to see those continual paired up strikes [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=202.04s)]
*  with target flares lighting up the area, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=205.39999999999998s)]
*  then artillery coming in. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=207.76s)]
*  There's a lot of intelligence, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=209.23999999999998s)]
*  not only from the military, but also grassroots efforts. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=210.72s)]
*  Families here in Tel Aviv have set up a headquarters. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=213.95999999999998s)]
*  These are volunteers, family members, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  coming together to continually work [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  to find any possible information [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  that they can find on these hostages. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=223.64s)]
*  So a full hands-on effort to not only try to negotiate [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=225.72s)]
*  for their release, but use force if needed. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=229.36s)]
*  Yeah, it's amazing how much pressure [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=231.56s)]
*  the Israeli government's under from all sides. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  Alex, thanks so much. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdK-4Bzu5QA&t=235.48000000000002s)]
