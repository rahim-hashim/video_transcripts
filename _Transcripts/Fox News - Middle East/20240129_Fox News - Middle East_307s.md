# 'Not surprised' UN staff allegedly involved in Hamas' attack on Israel: Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I)
*  bring in former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, now a Fox News contributor, and just get your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=0.0s)]
*  take as to what is happening and what you think the White House and the Pentagon will [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=3.68s)]
*  say today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=8.24s)]
*  Well, Bill and Dana, thanks for having me on this morning. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=9.24s)]
*  It's pretty clear that the Biden administration's policies have resulted in a huge conflagration. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=13.34s)]
*  I hear people talking about whether we're going to end up at war with Iran. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=18.68s)]
*  I can assure you the Iranians are at war with the United States today. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=21.72s)]
*  They've now killed American servicemen, these three certainly in these past days, and we [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=25.12s)]
*  shouldn't forget the two Navy SEALs that lost their lives and the efforts in the region [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=29.54s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=33.58s)]
*  Dana, Bill, if we stay on our back foot, if we continue to be reactive, if we continue [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=34.58s)]
*  to say, gosh, when they do something, we're going to hold them accountable, the Iranians [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=38.94s)]
*  will continue at this. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=43.1s)]
*  And it will not only be in Israel, in Gaza, it will be all across the world. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=44.34s)]
*  They are the world's largest state sponsor of terror. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=49.28s)]
*  They're deeply connected to Iran and China. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=51.3s)]
*  And until President Biden manages to restore deterrence, I think we're risking escalation [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=53.94s)]
*  continuing in exactly the way we've seen it happen in these past weeks. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=58.74s)]
*  Well, a couple of things here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=61.7s)]
*  They've been trying not to give this thing the blow up and escalate more than it already [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=64.74000000000001s)]
*  has. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=67.7s)]
*  Here's the missile range that Iran has today. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=68.7s)]
*  This is quite stunning. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=71.02000000000001s)]
*  Ballistic and cruise missiles. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=72.98s)]
*  I mean, if you want to make the case, sir, they could hit eastern India and they could [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=73.98s)]
*  hit mainland Europe. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=78.42s)]
*  The axis of resistance, put this up here. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=80.34s)]
*  This is the route that Iran has used, and this is part of the reason why our U.S. troops [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=83.04s)]
*  are there, 3,500 of them, trying to prevent them from resupplying Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=87.5s)]
*  or the forces in Syria or even supplying forces in the West Bank there, just west of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=93.06s)]
*  where you see Jordan on the map. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  Jack Keene last hour, he said, he said, you got to hit the right target. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=100.98s)]
*  Mitch McConnell said, hit him hard. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=106.94s)]
*  Lindsey Graham says you have to go after Iran inside of Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=109.9s)]
*  When you try to balance not escalating a wider Middle East war with the appropriate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=115.1s)]
*  response to get Iran to back down, how do you calculate that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=120.94s)]
*  Well, Bill, I've had to do that. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=125.74s)]
*  I've been sitting in exactly the same spot Secretary Blinken is in today where he's advising [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=129.1s)]
*  President Biden. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=133.16s)]
*  I was advising President Trump when there was risk that we were going to lose deterrence. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=134.16s)]
*  Two thoughts. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=138.22s)]
*  First, it matters who the deterrer is. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=139.22s)]
*  The same strike taken by our administration will actually feel very different to the Iranians [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=140.74s)]
*  than one taken by President Biden because of Afghanistan, because of what's happening [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=144.98s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=149.06s)]
*  He is perceived as weak instead of strong. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=150.06s)]
*  I think that leads to a stronger response being required. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=152.38s)]
*  And whether that's inside of Iran or commercial targets in the Gulf or Iranian assets that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=156.06s)]
*  are around the world, this is going to have to be a serious response at scale, determined [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=160.98s)]
*  likely over time, or it'll just look like, hey, we're waiting for you all to kill some [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=165.62s)]
*  more Americans again and then we'll fire at some empty warehouses in Syria. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=170.42s)]
*  That would be an enormous mistake for the American people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=174.2s)]
*  I wish it was the case that what happened in Tehran stayed in Tehran, but the United [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  States is going to have to lead. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=181.0s)]
*  We will get our partners and friends to be along with us if we demonstrate that resolve [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  adequately, Bill. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=186.48s)]
*  The White House will brief at 1.30, the Pentagon at 2.30, so we'll have that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=188.16s)]
*  Also over the weekend, there was reports that there were actual staff members of the UN [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  refugee agency that supposedly helps take care of the Palestinians. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=197.56s)]
*  Now you have 12 countries pausing funding, including the United States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=202.2s)]
*  Austria and Japan also added to that list. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=205.79999999999998s)]
*  And now here's the Israel dossier detailing UN staffers' involvement in the Hamas attack. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=208.88s)]
*  Watch here. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=215.64s)]
*  One UN staffer kidnapped an Israeli woman. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  One UN staffer raided a kibbutz and participated in violence. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=220.7s)]
*  And one doled out ammunition to Hamas fighters in addition to the other support that we've [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=223.95999999999998s)]
*  seen. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=228.83999999999997s)]
*  Bill, I heard you say unbelievable. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=230.48s)]
*  Sadly, I'm not surprised in the least. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=234.28s)]
*  It's the very reason we stopped funding UNRWA and the Trump administration. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=237.32s)]
*  This is known. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=241.16s)]
*  We have known that this was a corrupt institution. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=242.24s)]
*  We have known that the difference between an UNRWA employee and someone working on behalf [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=244.38s)]
*  of the Iranians has always been difficult to distinguish. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  We knew a lot of that money was going towards educating with the most anti-Semitic educational [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=251.52s)]
*  tools available. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=256.2s)]
*  We should have stopped funding UNRWA. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=257.84000000000003s)]
*  The Biden administration turned it back on and you can see the direct result of this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=260.24s)]
*  Bill, I will not be shocked at all if we learned that there wasn't just a dozen, but dozens [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=263.42s)]
*  and dozens and dozens of UN employees proving the UN's moral failure. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=269.18s)]
*  This will be dozens and dozens of UN employees that were involved in the events of October [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=273.62s)]
*  7th and the holding of American hostages since that day. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=277.62s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=280.94s)]
*  Well, that's a remarkable statement. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=281.94s)]
*  Let's get the information out there. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=282.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=284.34000000000003s)]
*  And your comment from earlier. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=286.34000000000003s)]
*  Iran is at war with us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=287.34s)]
*  Let that settle in. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=289.06s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time today. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=291.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DAnC5E6969I&t=292.7s)]
