# Exiled Iranian activist: ‘I don’t know whether to laugh or cry about this’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs)
*  Well, Iran has a long history of using Hamas and other armed groups as puppets, offering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=0.0s)]
*  financial and political support to the so-called Axis of Resistance and propping up an alliance [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=4.32s)]
*  of armed militias to wage war against Israel and the West. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=9.4s)]
*  Our next guest knows it well. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=12.72s)]
*  Masih Alinijad, excuse me, is an Iranian journalist and activist. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=14.4s)]
*  You might have seen her on 60 Minutes, but you've seen her on our air as well. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=18.36s)]
*  You're a friend of the show and it's good to have you here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  On Jillian's report, in your experience, what does humanitarian aid look like in Iran? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=23.48s)]
*  I really don't know whether I laugh or cry when it comes to even the Biden administration [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  saying that they are using for humanitarian purpose. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  I'm here to tell you that for the Islamic Republic, eliminating Israel is humanitarian [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=39.760000000000005s)]
*  cause. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=46.32s)]
*  For the Islamic Republic, killing teenagers in Iran who show their hair, it's actually [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=47.6s)]
*  they're saying that we're doing humanitarian cause because they are spreading corruption [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=53.92s)]
*  on earth. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=59.32s)]
*  So that's very clear for us. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=60.6s)]
*  The money immediately goes to Hassan Nasrullah, to Hamas, to Hezbollah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=62.28s)]
*  It's very clear the money goes to the proxies, not only in the Middle East, here on US soil [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=67.36s)]
*  for their transnational repression. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=74.36s)]
*  And that is why I get furious when I hear the war humanitarian purpose and the West [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=77.12s)]
*  buying that. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=83.32000000000001s)]
*  Can you help explain, I'm trying to triangulate this, right? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=85.16000000000001s)]
*  There's a piece in Reuters today that says, Iran's supreme leader told the head of Hamas, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=89.52000000000001s)]
*  you told us you weren't going to do this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=94.78s)]
*  And the leader of Hezbollah in Lebanon is distancing, but Hezbollah has not really taken [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=97.36000000000001s)]
*  a lot of that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=101.88000000000001s)]
*  We've seen a little bit on the northern border, but not a ton. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  So now the Houthis in Yemen, they're firing or trying to reach Israel along the way. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=105.82s)]
*  Can you put this into some logical explanation as to what you think the truth is between [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=112.58s)]
*  who knew what and maybe what happens next? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=118.78s)]
*  You know, the Ayatollahs are really good at actually misleading the rest of the world [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=122.46s)]
*  when they are failing. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  If they were very successful, if the retaliation were successful right now, they would have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=130.46s)]
*  proudly said that, yes, we were behind that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=135.98000000000002s)]
*  But now they lost it. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=139.22s)]
*  So that's why instead of admitting that they knew about the retaliation, they knew about [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=140.78s)]
*  the, sorry, they knew about the attacks, the terrorist attacks, they're trying to hide [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=145.86s)]
*  themselves behind ordinary civilians, Palestinians. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=150.38s)]
*  So that is why I'm furious. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=155.4s)]
*  As a woman coming from the Middle East, I know very well that Hamas, Khamenei, Hezbollah, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=157.1s)]
*  they're not speaking for Iranian people or for people in Palestine, in Gaza. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  So that's why they're using this human-like shelter to hide themselves behind it. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  Like Hassan Nasrallah was always loud and saying that, you know, without the money from [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=173.26s)]
*  Islamic Republic, we cannot do anything. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=178.62s)]
*  The Islamic Republic, Ayatollahs, very clear, saying that although we are suffering from [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=180.94s)]
*  we give money to Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=185.5s)]
*  They had a meeting in Iran right before the terrorist attacks. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  Ismail Haniyeh, the spokesperson of Hamas, had a meeting with Khamenei. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=192.62s)]
*  Fourth, October 4th, only four days before the attack, Khamenei said- [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=197.34s)]
*  Given all that, then why are we afraid to cut off their money? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=201.66s)]
*  I mean, to be honest, I am very confused whether it's because of the money, oil, or they want [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=205.78s)]
*  to be politically correct. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=212.82s)]
*  I don't really get it because Hamas and Hezbollah, an Islamic Republic, they're not only a threat [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=214.34s)]
*  for people in the Middle East. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  They are the ones sending drones to Putin to kill innocent Ukrainians. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=222.74s)]
*  They are the ones actually targeted the dissidents abroad, like beyond their own borders. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=226.62s)]
*  I myself, I'm the victim of transnational repression and the Islamic Republic agents [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=232.54s)]
*  are in Canada as well. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=238.58s)]
*  Like 700 agents of the Islamic Republic. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=240.02s)]
*  Can you believe that? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=243.82s)]
*  700 agents are living their luxury lives in Canada. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=245.1s)]
*  There are more than 300 properties belong to Islamic Republic agents. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=249.82s)]
*  Justin Trudeau, President Biden, your allies, you must get united. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=256.06s)]
*  First, designate the Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist organization. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=260.9s)]
*  Third, isolate the Islamic Republic and treat them like warmonger. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=264.5s)]
*  They have to be addressed the way that Putin being addressed by Europeans. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=268.18s)]
*  No one says it better. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuQBZprehxs&t=273.21999999999997s)]
