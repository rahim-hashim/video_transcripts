# This is an 'absolute disaster' brought to you by the Biden admin
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8)
*  All right, a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. is expecting Iran to retaliate against Israel as soon as today, after the IDF took [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=2.92s)]
*  out several Hamas and Hezbollah leaders last week. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=8.28s)]
*  The state of Israel is in a multi-front war against Iran's axis of evil. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  We hit each of its arms hard. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=20.12s)]
*  We are prepared for any scenario, both in defense and attack. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=22.42s)]
*  Here to react is U.S. Senate candidate and former Congressman Mike Rogers. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=27.12s)]
*  Good morning, Congressman. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=30.76s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=32.24s)]
*  This is scary news for Americans sitting at home. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=33.56s)]
*  We've kind of had this rhetoric of no new wars, don't get us into a war. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=37.0s)]
*  We've talked politically about what's happening in Ukraine and the Middle East, but now it [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=41.04s)]
*  just seems almost inevitable. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=44.32s)]
*  What's your assessment? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  Yeah, it's going to happen. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  I talked to senior Israeli officials in the last few weeks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=50.96s)]
*  They think it's inevitable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=56.94s)]
*  So what Iran has to make a calculation here, Joey, are they going to broaden the front, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=58.56s)]
*  meaning they're going to attack a wider set of targets in Israel, or are they going to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  try to do something really that they can argue is a retaliation without trying to expand [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=68.56s)]
*  the war? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=74.56s)]
*  I really don't think Iran wants to get into a full-blown war, and I think that's why they're [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=75.56s)]
*  being calculated and what targets they're going to try to shoot down. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=80.16s)]
*  And even if they don't get them all, I think they might say that's it. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=82.88s)]
*  We've retaliated. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=85.88s)]
*  We're done here. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=86.88s)]
*  Mainly because, again, Israel has the capability of taking out senior leadership in Iran, and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  by the way, so does the U.S., and the U.S. has a big presence certainly in that area [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=94.72s)]
*  now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=99.92s)]
*  I know you served on the Intelligence Committee, so you're privy to the information just by [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=100.92s)]
*  the nature of it that the rest of us maybe aren't, or at least the details. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=103.32s)]
*  I hear you say, I don't think Iran wants to get into a larger war, and it seems to me [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=107.32s)]
*  that is our defense strategy here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=112.44s)]
*  That is our deterrence, is the simple belief that they don't want a bigger war. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=114.96s)]
*  That's scary to me. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  Do you have any information that, you know, how sure are you on that, and is that the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  strategy of this administration? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=125.82s)]
*  Well, I mean, this administration got this thing wrong from the very beginning, Joy. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=127.72s)]
*  If you think about what just happened, you know, they told the Saudis when they got, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=133.44s)]
*  the Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration told the Saudis when they got [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=137.44s)]
*  an office, you can't go after the Houthis. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=141.0s)]
*  Matter of fact, we're not going to sell you arms to do that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=143.0s)]
*  Then they took the Houthis off the terrorist list, and the Houthis, by the way, were getting [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=146.0s)]
*  financing and training and good weapons systems from Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=151.0s)]
*  The Houthis are now attacking U.S. ships, you know, commercial ships and U.S. military [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=156.0s)]
*  ships, and they fired a drone into Israel. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=161.0s)]
*  And, you know, Iran funds Hezbollah, they fund Hamas. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=164.36s)]
*  We paid them $6 billion for hostages. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=169.68s)]
*  Then they let them sell oil, $250 billion of cash. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=172.8s)]
*  If you're arguing, this could have been completely preventable. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=178.28s)]
*  This is an absolute disaster brought to you by really bad decisions by the Biden-Harris [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=181.22s)]
*  administration. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=187.2s)]
*  And so now I think it is, does Iran want a broader conflict? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  I think they like the fight with their proxy, their proxy forces, attacking even U.S. interests [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=191.95999999999998s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=197.92s)]
*  But I just don't believe that they want a bigger, broader war. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=198.92s)]
*  I don't think they would fare very well with both the United States and Israel trying to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=202.56s)]
*  take out their command and control in Tehran. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=207.2s)]
*  I don't think they, I don't think that they want that. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=209.56s)]
*  Quickly, Congressman, before I let you go, voters in Michigan, head to the polls tomorrow [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=212.6s)]
*  for what is going to be a tight race for the Senate seat. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=217.32s)]
*  You're the favorite to win the primary tomorrow. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=220.2s)]
*  If you do win the primary, what is your pitch to the Michigan, to the voters of Michigan [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=223.04s)]
*  to elect you into the Senate as a GOP candidate and also to elect President Trump? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=227.84s)]
*  Listen, we're going to get back to normal. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=232.44s)]
*  We're going to make groceries affordable again. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=235.12s)]
*  We're going to close the border. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  We're going to make your communities safe again. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  We have just huge problems here in Michigan. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=241.5s)]
*  People are having a hard time making their paychecks stretch to the end of the month. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=243.56s)]
*  So we're going to get after those crime problems. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=247.2s)]
*  We're going to close the border. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=249.12s)]
*  We're going to unleash an American economy that actually gets us out of trouble and gets [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=250.56s)]
*  more prosperity to individual families working across the state of Michigan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=255.28s)]
*  So we're, we're pretty fired up about this fight and people know that their economy isn't [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=259.08s)]
*  very good and it's not likely to get better with Biden, Harris and in this case, probably [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=263.6s)]
*  with the slotkin economy. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=268.0s)]
*  Well, listen, former Congressman, U.S. Senate candidate, Mike Rogers, thank you for joining [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=269.48s)]
*  us. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=273.44s)]
*  Thanks for providing such good insight today on a scary situation and a good luck tomorrow [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=274.44s)]
*  and if we win in November. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcjr7ZbCOs8&t=278.76s)]
