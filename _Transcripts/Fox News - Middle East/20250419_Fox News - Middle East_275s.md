# A nuclear-armed Iran would be the ‘GREATEST THREAT’ since WWII, says Col. Kemp
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA)
*  Welcome back America. We're here with a good friend of mine and my family, retired Colonel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=0.0s)]
*  British Forces in Afghanistan Commander Richard Kemp, chairman of the Cobra Intelligence Group. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=7.76s)]
*  Richard Kemp, they can't call you a chicken hawk. You're a combat veteran. You have fought [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=13.6s)]
*  in Afghanistan and elsewhere. You have fought terrorists. You know this mindset. So Richard [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=19.04s)]
*  Kemp, what is the mindset of the Iranian regime and do you think that they would adhere for the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=25.28s)]
*  first time ever to some kind of ironclad agreement? No, I think the Iranian and a nuclear armed Iran [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=31.28s)]
*  would represent the greatest threat to Western civilization and of course to the Middle East [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=40.08s)]
*  that's ever existed since the Second World War and that's partly because of the potency of nuclear [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=46.72s)]
*  weapons and it's partly because of the mentality of the Iranian fanatical jihadist regime. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=52.64s)]
*  They're not like the Russians. They're not like China even. They're not a country that is [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=60.800000000000004s)]
*  amenable to reason or indeed to the concept of mutual assured destruction, which you mentioned [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  earlier. If they have a nuclear weapon and we believe they intend to use it, we've got to assume [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  that that's a very real danger. They've said many times, death to America. It's part of the entire [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  basis of the Iranian regime, death to America, death to Israel and we can't assume that if they [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=88.24s)]
*  have it, if they have the capability, they won't use it. Only a few days ago, Khomeini, the supreme [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=94.96s)]
*  leader of Iran, explained in detail why he needs to destroy Israel. So we've got to assume that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=102.0s)]
*  if they have a nuclear weapon, they will use it and there is only one way of preventing them [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  from gaining that nuclear weapon, which they're already very advanced in their program, very [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  advanced, both in terms of developing highly enriched uranium, working on the means of delivering [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  it, ballistic missiles and also through weaponizing the program. They're very close. If not, it's [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=126.96s)]
*  possible even they have the capability today. And there's only one way of stopping that and that's [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=134.08s)]
*  by military action to destroy their nuclear program once and for all. Now there is a possibility of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=138.96s)]
*  negotiations, but we know one thing. We know that Iran are master negotiations. They're masters of [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=146.56s)]
*  deception. They're masters of lying. They're masters of dragging out and drawing out any [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=154.0s)]
*  negotiations while they're meanwhile working on the program. So although I can understand why [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=159.28s)]
*  President Trump is interested in negotiations, personally, I don't think that they're going to [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=165.12s)]
*  achieve what needs to be achieved here. And I think we're going to face a real problem with [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=170.56s)]
*  things like verification. We can't just accept a paper promised by them. We've got to see [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=178.72s)]
*  verifiable actual dismantling of their nuclear program. We've got to see the [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=184.55999999999997s)]
*  enriched uranium shipped out of that country or destroyed. And we've got to see their entire [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=191.51999999999998s)]
*  infrastructure for developing weaponization, developing nuclear weapons. That's got to be [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  dismantled verifiably, not just on paper. And my view is that Iran is not going to agree to that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=202.0s)]
*  Iran is going to have to, Iran is going to maybe spin it out, lie, deceive, and no doubt be [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=208.96s)]
*  assisted by the Europeans who don't have the spine to support an attack on Iran. Europeans are very [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=215.28s)]
*  likely, in my view, to help them, maybe inadvertently, but help them to spin out this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=221.92000000000002s)]
*  negotiation while they continue to develop their program. So yeah, negotiate, but make sure it's [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=229.28s)]
*  for a very limited period of time. Make sure if it does come to some conclusion, it is absolutely [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=236.96s)]
*  practically verifiable. And then if not, if that, if the period of time that they've been given, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=244.32000000000002s)]
*  which I think President Trump gave them 60 days, if that's not achieved, then they have to be hit [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=250.0s)]
*  and hit very hard by the United States of America, probably supported by Israel, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  to destroy their nuclear program. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uI6v4BVJ9yA&t=260.32s)]
