# Reuters video journalist killed in Lebanon rocket strike during live feed
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo)
*  Violence escalating turning deadly in Lebanon a Reuters video journalists were told has been killed in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=0.0s)]
*  Southern Lebanon after his crew was hit by Israeli artillery [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=6.84s)]
*  Talking about some of the bombardment in the northern border Jonathan hunt is live with the latest. We're just getting this Jonathan [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=11.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm Brett Trey was just talking about the skirmishes that were happening on the border between Lebanon and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Israel this Reuters crew was stationed in southern Lebanon [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=25.64s)]
*  Very close to the border. They were filming [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=30.48s)]
*  What was the aftermath of those skirmishes which were in fact ongoing we could clearly hear as we monitored it live [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=34.32s)]
*  Gunfire on the live feed and then this happened listen [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=41.32s)]
*  That as you can hear is a strike [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=51.760000000000005s)]
*  Happening very close to that Reuters camera [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=55.8s)]
*  We now understand that a Reuters cameraman was killed the agency has issued a statement which said quote [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=59.28s)]
*  We are deeply saddened to learn that our videographer [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=66.03999999999999s)]
*  Issam Abdullah has been killed as Sam was part of a Reuters crew in southern Lebanon who was providing a live signal [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=69.32s)]
*  We are urgently seeking more information [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=76.86s)]
*  Working with authorities in the region and supporting Issam's family and colleagues Reuters journalists [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=79.42s)]
*  They're Al Sadani and mayor Naza also sustained injuries and are seeking medical care [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=85.3s)]
*  Our thoughts are with their families at this terrible time. We have a picture. I believe of some [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=91.46s)]
*  Abdullah the videographer who was killed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=98.58s)]
*  Not sure we have that right now [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=101.86s)]
*  The dangers as Trey was talking about of Hezbollah getting involved here [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=104.46s)]
*  We had it in 2006 after the kidnapping of the Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit down in Gaza [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=108.69999999999999s)]
*  Then Hezbollah got involved about three weeks later July 12th [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=115.22s)]
*  They began firing those rockets that Trey was talking about across the border into Israel [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=119.85999999999999s)]
*  There was a border skirmish three Israeli soldiers were killed and then Israel went in hard with the airstrikes and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=125.02s)]
*  Artillery that is the great fear now Brett that we could see what happened in 2006 again [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=132.58s)]
*  but on an even greater level and remember if Hamas is tied very closely to Iran [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=138.26000000000002s)]
*  Nobody is more closely tied than Hezbollah and Hezbollah [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=145.94s)]
*  It is worth pointing out Brett is far better armed far better organized than Hamas is in Gaza [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=149.74s)]
*  Hezbollah has far greater precision [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=157.98000000000002s)]
*  Munitions which present a far greater threat even than Hamas does to Israel [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=160.85999999999999s)]
*  So it is a very tense situation. Nobody wants to see violence breaking out on the Lebanon Israel border Brett [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=166.7s)]
*  Yeah, and Jonathan, you know, it's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=173.42s)]
*  It's truly sad to hear this it is an example of how dangerous it is to cover a war zone overall [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=175.66s)]
*  Obviously we here at Fox have felt that directly with Benjamin Hall and his crew the loss of the cameraman Pierre [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=182.14s)]
*  And and a translator and fixer [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=189.18s)]
*  There's no more word about other skirmishes along that border, right? I mean this incident [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=193.62s)]
*  Tracks with what Sandra and Trey were talking about over the last couple of hours. Yeah [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=200.78s)]
*  Yeah, it seems to be that there was an exchange of fire with Hezbollah and a possible exchange of fire [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  With a Lebanese army unit there as well [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=212.3s)]
*  We believe that this Reuters crew may have been near that Lebanese army base [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=215.82s)]
*  But again the the information we get in the early going in these situations doesn't [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=220.58s)]
*  often changes Brett so I want to caution our viewers about that, but we haven't heard of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=226.62s)]
*  Rockets for instance coming in any great numbers from Hezbollah into northern Israel as yet [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=233.26s)]
*  But that would be the fear and that would very literally be a game-changer in this conflict Brett if Hezbollah [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=239.3s)]
*  starts firing their very [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=247.18s)]
*  Sophisticated rockets into Israel rockets, which by the way can hit any city [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=250.38000000000002s)]
*  Anywhere in Israel they have the precision to do that. They have the range to do that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=257.02s)]
*  So that would be a game changer. That is what? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=263.12s)]
*  Powers within the region the United States as well the French government for instance are trying very hard to avoid [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=266.62s)]
*  But Hezbollah will do as it has said what it wants to and by that it means what Iran wants it to do [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=273.58000000000004s)]
*  Brett Jonathan our hearts and our thoughts and everything our prayers are with the family of [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=280.62s)]
*  Issam Abdullah [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=287.94s)]
*  The videographer who we now can confirm has been killed. Hey everyone [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fUY7IL9htKo&t=289.66s)]
