# Major U.S. cities on high alert following threat from ex-Hamas official
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM)
*  Beat time cities here in the United States are bracing for protests today after a former Hamas leader called for anti-Israel demonstrations across the globe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=0.0s)]
*  Quote, we must head to the squares and streets of the Arab and Islamic world to all scholars who teach jihad, to all who teach and learn that this is a moment for the application of theories. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=8.32s)]
*  That's right. And here in New York, the police department is calling for an all-hands-on-deck situation, ordering all officers to report to work in uniform today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=19.84s)]
*  Angel Masonette is a former NYPD detective and 9-11 first responder and joins us now. Angel, good morning to you. What do you think about this? Should people be worried? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=28.16s)]
*  Absolutely, right. They have to be worried. We want you to be prepared and not scared, obviously, right. That's always the mantra. But yeah, there's things to worry about, right. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  I mean, we have a lot of Jews that live in New York City, right. A lot of people who go to, there's a lot of houses of worship, a lot of synagogues. And the NYPD has to be prepared and people have to be prepared as well. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=48.88s)]
*  Yesterday, the governor of New York said they have not heard of any credible threats. Obviously, Angel, you are tapped into the law enforcement community. As we sit here this morning, have you heard of any credible threats? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=61.36s)]
*  No, there hasn't been. There's been chatter ever since this came out. Actually, since this war started, right, the war that Hamas started when they attacked Israel, there's been a lot of chatter going on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=74.47999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, you want your intel partners to keep you up to date. But, you know, there's nothing credible. As of this point right now, they're saying there's nothing credible, no credible threat. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=85.19999999999999s)]
*  So this order for all cops to report in uniform today, what does that actually mean? Because I did assume that when police officers reported to work every day, they would report in their uniform. So what's significant about this order? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  So you have specialized units, right? You have other units, detective bureaus, things of that nature, officers that, you know, work behind the scenes, so to speak, and they're not necessarily always in uniforms. They're in suits or what have you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=109.6s)]
*  So now this says, hey, everybody cancel your days off. Guess what? If you're going on vacation, you're going on a cruise with your family, you can't go. It doesn't matter if you paid. It doesn't matter what you did. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=122.4s)]
*  You have to come into work, you have to have your uniform ready, and you have to be ready to be deployed to the different parts of the city. The strategic response group, which you just showed on the clip there, those officers, you're 700 strong, they're out there in the city. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=133.84s)]
*  People wanted to disband them. This is why we have this, right? This is why we have the NYPD always prepared, you know, the largest police department in the world. And, you know, they're going to go do their jobs, you know, in spite of, you know, missing time with their families and being put in the position they're being put in. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=150.32s)]
*  Angel, you were in the Counterterrorism Task Force. What is that unit specifically on the lookout for right now as we speak? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=169.68s)]
*  So, yes, I was on the Joint Terrorism Task Force. And, you know, again, right, we're looking for, we have techlers out, right? We have our federal partners. We have partners overseas that help us out and give us intel, right? The biggest thing is intel. You need intel in order to get ahead of these things, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=178.16s)]
*  It depends on what's able to be disseminated, what's able to be shared. There's a lot of moving parts to this. You have a lot of rumors. You know, when I retired in 2014, I was on the TTF from 07 to 14. You know, social media, things of that nature, it's gone up right now. Things are different, right? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=195.36s)]
*  You have a lot of people out there sharing stuff without context. It raises things up around the country, around the world, and it's harder to get real, bona fide intel. So, you know, you want to filter stuff down, make sure that it's bona fide, make sure that it's credible, get it out to the folks in the field, and hopefully be prepared. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=213.76s)]
*  Absolutely. Be prepared. That is the message this morning. Angel, thank you for joining us. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DdmwFW0HcoM&t=231.28s)]
