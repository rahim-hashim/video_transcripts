# John Kennedy takes swipe at Biden admin on Iran: Being ‘nice guys’ won't work
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU)
*  Louisiana Senator John Kennedy joins me now. Senator, always good to have you with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=0.0s)]
*  This is particularly interesting in light of the fact that in reports today and this week, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=4.48s)]
*  Hamas leaders and spokespeople have said, look, it's not our, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=11.6s)]
*  we don't provide the electricity and the water to Gaza. That's not what we do. We want a permanent [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=15.76s)]
*  battle with Israel. So they're happy to do that from Lebanon and from Qatar, apparently, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  while all of the people that still live in Gaza suffer. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=29.52s)]
*  There is no cause in the world that justifies what Hamas did, Martha. Burning babies alive, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=36.16s)]
*  slitting their throats all the while yelling for joy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  And spare me this, the retort that we often hear, but these people are oppressed. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  All the college kids and the faculty members at these universities who believe in diversity, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=66.24s)]
*  equity and inclusion and the right to kill Jews. Well, this is America and they're entitled to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=75.84s)]
*  their opinion, but I'm entitled to mine and they ought to be ashamed of themselves. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  Part of the reason we find ourselves in a world on fire in Ukraine, in the Indo-Pacific and now [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=91.44s)]
*  in the Middle East is because of our naivety and our weakness, and more specifically the naivety [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=99.28s)]
*  and the weakness of the Biden administration. We're playing footsie and we have for years with [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=109.68s)]
*  Qatar. Qatar does provide the electricity for Gaza. In effect, they give it to Hamas [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=116.4s)]
*  and the Biden administration allows it. The Biden administration allows billionaires [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=126.64s)]
*  to live in Qatar and not just from Hamas, but also from ISIS. The Biden administration sends [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=133.84s)]
*  a message of weakness when it refuses to enforce the oil sanctions on Iran, when it cut and ran [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=142.16s)]
*  in Afghanistan, when it removed the sanctions on Russia's Nord Stream 2 pipeline, when it gave [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=149.04s)]
*  Iran $4.5 billion in cash from the International Monetary Fund. And I could go on. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=157.12s)]
*  And the problem we've got, it's not the total responsibility for this, but President Biden [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=166.72s)]
*  and his team think while we're in the middle of a bar fight or a prison riot, they want to quote [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=174.0s)]
*  Socrates and read Beowulf and think if we're just nice guys that we can be partners with Iran. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=182.0s)]
*  And we can't. We have to wipe Hamas off the face of the earth. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=191.36s)]
*  So, Senator, you talk about a big picture of weakness that you think has led to a lot of this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=198.24s)]
*  And I'm thinking about the election results last night. And I'm wondering what you think about that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  We see a lot of weakness in the polls for the president whose faults you just outlined in your [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=209.76s)]
*  opinion. So what goes through your mind when you see the way that the American people are expressing [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=214.88s)]
*  themselves in voting booths in just this small pocket of what we saw last night? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=220.88s)]
*  Well, I mean, last night was not a big surprise to me. I think the Democrats had a better night [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=226.0s)]
*  than the Republicans. But I wasn't surprised at what happened in Virginia. It's a blue state [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=232.72s)]
*  or in Kentucky or in Mississippi or in Ohio. In terms of the bigger picture, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=237.44000000000003s)]
*  I'm not saying this is fair, but most Americans think that what President Biden really needs [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  is some soup in an early bedtime. They think he's too old to be president. And I think our [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=255.28s)]
*  opponents, our enemies in Iran, China and Russia see the same thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=260.88s)]
*  Senator, thank you very much. Senator Kennedy from Louisiana joining us today from Capitol Hill. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=269.92s)]
*  Always good to speak with you, sir. Thank you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkUeiJmAHZU&t=276.0s)]
