# BREAKING: Trump reveals details behind striking Iran nuclear sites
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 21, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc)
*  And welcome to Hannity. We begin tonight with this Fox News alert. I just spoke to the president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=0.0s)]
*  of the United States. I have some new information and breaking details to share about tonight's [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=8.0s)]
*  what is historic air campaign. Now tonight, Iran's nuclear ambitions, they are officially [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=13.46s)]
*  dead. It appears the United States just completely obliterated Iran's top secret Fordo nuclear [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=19.68s)]
*  facility with six huge bunker buster bombs. It was originally speculated that you would [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=26.36s)]
*  only need two. It turns out they use five to six dropped from America's stealth B2 [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=33.08s)]
*  bombers. And that's not all. Two other major Iranian nuclear sites, Natanz and Estefan, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=39.24s)]
*  were wiped out with 30 Tomahawk missiles launched by American submarines some 400 miles away. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=46.760000000000005s)]
*  Everyone is out of harm's way for now. That does not mean that American assets in the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=53.88s)]
*  region are not at risk. And we are monitoring the Iranian response or potential response [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=58.72s)]
*  all throughout the night. We expect the president will be speaking sometime either in this hour [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=64.92s)]
*  or in the next hour. In a statement, the president posted two truths socially wrote, quote, we [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  have completed our very successful attack on the three nuclear sites in Iran, including [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  the Fordo site, Natanz and Estefan. All planes are now outside of Iranian airspace. A full [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=81.32s)]
*  payload of bombs was dropped on the primary site. That's Fordo and all planes are safely [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=89.83999999999999s)]
*  on their way home. Congratulations to our great American warriors. There is not another [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=96.32s)]
*  military in the world that could have done this. Now is the time for peace. We will hear [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=101.63999999999999s)]
*  more from the president. We expect within the next hour, hour and a half, we will be [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=106.9s)]
*  on at least till 11 Eastern tonight from the White House. And of course, we'll take you [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=111.38000000000001s)]
*  there live as it all happens. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LREybFYmeNc&t=116.38000000000001s)]
