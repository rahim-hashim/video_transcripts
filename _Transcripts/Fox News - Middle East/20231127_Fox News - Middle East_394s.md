# Mike Pompeo: This is precisely what Iran hoped for
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY)
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, the former, with us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=0.0s)]
*  And sir, good morning to you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=3.08s)]
*  Mike Pompeo joins us here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=4.08s)]
*  Trey Yanks brought us a report around 6 o'clock this morning saying that Hamas doesn't have [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=6.12s)]
*  control of all these remaining hostages. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=11.32s)]
*  Let's say there are roughly 200 left over still in Gaza. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=13.48s)]
*  And Islamic Jihad has maybe 40, upwards of 50. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  So how are we going to find our way out of this? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=22.44s)]
*  And do you believe an extended truce is the right move now? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=25.0s)]
*  Well, good morning, Bill. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=29.72s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=32.16s)]
*  Look, I've not tried to second-guess the Israeli decision-making process. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=33.64s)]
*  It's got to be wrenching. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=37.72s)]
*  The pure joy of seeing these families reunited is something we can all rejoice in. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=39.22s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, whether it's the PIJ, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad, or [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=43.84s)]
*  just some rogue criminals that are continuing to hold Israelis, this challenge remains an [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=48.68s)]
*  operational and strategic one for the security of all Israeli people, not just those who've [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=52.62s)]
*  got loved ones that are in harm's way today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=56.98s)]
*  And so the Israeli leadership will have to make a series of just wrenching decisions [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=59.98s)]
*  about how to do this. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=64.06s)]
*  But we shouldn't forget, while we're all focused on these crossings, the return of these [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=65.06s)]
*  hostages, this is precisely what the Ayatollah in Iran had hoped for. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=69.42s)]
*  He had hoped precisely that our love of life, our decency, our humanity would prevent us [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=73.66s)]
*  from keeping our eye on the ball, which is protecting the citizens we're responsible [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=78.46s)]
*  for. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=82.3s)]
*  And as these releases are taking place, there are attacks on Americans throughout the theater. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=83.3s)]
*  You talked just a moment ago about a report from strikes from Hezbollah. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=86.69999999999999s)]
*  What's happening in Gaza is just one element, one tactical region of a larger theater and [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=90.46s)]
*  a scope of the ring of fire that has been built out over years by Iran. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  Speaking of that, Senator Tom Cotton was on the Sunday show, and he says there should [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=100.53999999999999s)]
*  be some massive retaliation. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=105.8s)]
*  Tom, what's your thoughts on this? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=107.62s)]
*  I would target Iranians who are operating in Iraq and in Syria. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=108.62s)]
*  I would also send a clear message to Iran if these attacks don't stop immediately, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=113.06s)]
*  then we'll begin to threaten their assets. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=117.14s)]
*  The way to stop these attacks is not to be fearful and hesitant and cautious in a response, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=119.54s)]
*  but massive retaliation to make it clear we will not tolerate these attacks on Americans. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=125.26s)]
*  What do you think the conversations are like inside the administration on this? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=130.58s)]
*  Dana, I hope they're precisely what Senator Cotton described. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=134.78s)]
*  I fear that they are not. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=139.7s)]
*  He and I have been working on this Iran problem together since 2015, since the first inklings [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=140.98s)]
*  of the JCPOA. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=146.42s)]
*  It's coming on a decade now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=147.61999999999998s)]
*  And what you can say over this entire decade is there's only one thing that Iran will respond [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=149.76s)]
*  to. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  If we're going to protect American soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines, if we're going [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=154.29999999999998s)]
*  to protect the American homeland from attacks by Hezbollah cells there in South America [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=157.54s)]
*  or perhaps even here inside the United States, you can't just go after their proxies. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=162.48s)]
*  The fact that there are Hamas fighters dying while the Iranians are sitting in Tehran laughing [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=166.76s)]
*  is exactly what the Ayatollah had hoped for. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  And so Senator Cotton's right. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=174.62s)]
*  This will have to be cost imposing on the regime itself. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=176.54s)]
*  We know how to do it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=179.04s)]
*  The target list is long. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=180.14s)]
*  The tool set that we have isn't just operational and open. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=181.76s)]
*  It's clandestine and deep. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=185.88s)]
*  We have lots of ways we can impose costs on them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=187.6s)]
*  But as long as we're simply talking about, gosh, are we going to have a pause or not [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=189.52s)]
*  a pause, I am confident that Iran will continue to inflict its terror all around the world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=193.32000000000002s)]
*  You're right about that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=199.28s)]
*  That line you just gave there, the ring of fire, really encompasses the entire region [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=200.44s)]
*  here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=204.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's go back to January of 2020 when Soleimani was taken out when he landed at that airport [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=205.48000000000002s)]
*  in Baghdad. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=209.72s)]
*  Just play this out for us. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  If this administration had the guts to go ahead and go after some of this leadership, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=213.56s)]
*  Maybe it's these Hamas leaders living in Qatar, hundreds if not thousands of miles [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=217.64s)]
*  away from the conflict in Gaza. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  What would happen throughout the region? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=226.16s)]
*  What would be your best guess as to how that would unfold? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't have to guess. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=233.67999999999998s)]
*  I'll describe what happened that day when we took the strike on General Soleimani. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=234.67999999999998s)]
*  I remember it vividly. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=238.88s)]
*  I was in the middle of it. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=240.32s)]
*  The first thing that happened is we took someone off the battlefield who was orchestrating [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=242.44s)]
*  attacks on Americans and presenting risk to American lives. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=246.22s)]
*  So as a tactical and operational matter, we took out a bad guy and saved American lives. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=249.02s)]
*  But your point is a larger one, which is that the whole world took note of this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=253.86s)]
*  Our friends in the region, the Iranians, the Qataris, the Amirates, the Saudis, they took [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=258.14s)]
*  note. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=263.74s)]
*  They said, gosh, these Americans are real. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=264.74s)]
*  They're going to protect us. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=265.74s)]
*  They're going to preserve decency. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=266.9s)]
*  The Iranians took note. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=269.22s)]
*  They had been in the days leading up to that. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=270.78s)]
*  They'd been attacking our embassy in Baghdad. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=272.7s)]
*  The attack had virtually stopped after the attack on Soleimani. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=274.5s)]
*  And you should note, it not only mattered in the region, in the Middle East, but it [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=277.38s)]
*  mattered all around the world. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=280.78s)]
*  They saw an administration that was prepared to deter adversaries and protect America. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=281.78s)]
*  It had a deterrent effect all over, Bill. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=286.58s)]
*  I hope this administration has the same level of seriousness in protecting America. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=288.74s)]
*  I haven't seen it to date. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=293.5s)]
*  But Mr. Secretary, we also haven't seen regional leaders condemning Hamas's actions. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=294.62s)]
*  No, I agree. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=302.9s)]
*  That should happen. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=305.62s)]
*  Not just regional leaders, leaders all across the world, including in New York City, at [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=306.62s)]
*  the United Nations, where they have been absolutely abhorrent on this set of issues, describing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=311.02s)]
*  what's taking place in Gaza as the worst thing that's happened in a long time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=314.97999999999996s)]
*  That's not remotely true. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=318.9s)]
*  We need the whole world to understand the barbarity of what took place on October 7th [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=321.17999999999995s)]
*  and Israel's basic, most fundamental right and, in fact, need to protect and defend its [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=325.78s)]
*  own sovereignty. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=330.09999999999997s)]
*  We need every leader to do that. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=331.18s)]
*  It will take American leadership, Dana. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=332.42s)]
*  When America's on the sidelines, when we're ambiguous, when we're talking, kind of wandering [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=334.74s)]
*  around, talking about, gosh, I wish there'd be a longer pause, the whole world knows that [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=338.98s)]
*  we're actually putting pressure on Israel to stand down. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=342.86s)]
*  And when that happens, those leaders begin to hedge. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=345.3s)]
*  In this Washington Post article over the weekend, there's a story about there's dissent within [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=348.22s)]
*  the White House and the Biden administration. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=352.66s)]
*  There's a quote from a senior official of the Biden administration that said, we're [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=354.62s)]
*  taking on a lot of water on Israel's behalf, which I think signals that they've got other [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=358.74s)]
*  considerations in mind at the moment. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=364.5s)]
*  Maybe not at the top with President Biden, but we'll see. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=366.62s)]
*  You've seen it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=369.3s)]
*  Dana, you've seen that she worked in a White House. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=370.3s)]
*  That pressure from inside that White House will be enormous to demand Israel stand down. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=373.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=377.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=378.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=379.42s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, beginning a brand new interview today. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=380.42s)]
*  Thank you, Dana. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=381.42s)]
*  Thank you, Bill. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=382.42s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGFjjJFpdaY&t=383.42s)]
