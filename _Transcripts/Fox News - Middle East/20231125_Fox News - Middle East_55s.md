# Military expert warns of 'existential threat' to Middle East #shorts
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk)
*  We have to recognize that Iran's not done with this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=0.0s)]
*  They've used Hamas for their initial effort. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=3.36s)]
*  They'll continue this. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=6.76s)]
*  And of course, psychologically, they're drumming up support for Hamas and really trying to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=7.76s)]
*  call off this war. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=13.16s)]
*  What we ought to do, though, is to be very deterrent. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=15.0s)]
*  And that is, we've got to hurt them either through IRGC, their coup force, or we have [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=18.76s)]
*  to put something at the bottom of the Red Sea or perhaps the Persian Gulf. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=25.4s)]
*  Otherwise, this nation, which continues to fuel not only the Middle East problems, but [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=32.92s)]
*  also helping Russia and Ukraine and elsewhere and fueling obviously what's going on in China [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=39.72s)]
*  through selling three million barrels of oil to them every day. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=46.12s)]
*  So we need to recognize this is an existential threat for the region. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LA73MHETAkk&t=50.5s)]
