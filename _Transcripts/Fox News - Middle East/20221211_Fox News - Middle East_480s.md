# China’s Xi Jinping takes major step to challenge US dollar in global trade
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 11, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU)
*  Welcome back. Chinese dictator Xi Jinping just back from what he is calling a milestone [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=0.0s)]
*  meeting with Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman after telling Arab leaders on Friday that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=6.24s)]
*  he wants to buy oil and gas with the Chinese Yuan instead of the US dollar, furthering [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=11.32s)]
*  his goal to internationalize the Chinese currency and replace the dollar as the reserve currency [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=16.64s)]
*  of the world. This after President Biden engineered a prisoner swap with Russia this week, releasing [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=21.56s)]
*  WNBA superstar Brittany Greiner in exchange for a Victor bout, sending the man known as [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=26.8s)]
*  the merchant of death back to Vladimir Putin in the middle of the war on Ukraine. The swap [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=32.88s)]
*  has been widely criticized because it did not include Marine veteran Paul Whelan, who [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=38.2s)]
*  Russia has kept locked up for the last four years on claims of espionage. Joining me right [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=42.36s)]
*  now to address all of that is retired four star general Jack Keane. He is the chairman [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=47.92s)]
*  of the Institute for the Study of War and a Fox News senior strategic analyst. General, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  it's great to see you this morning. Thank you so much for being here. Yeah, great being [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=56.2s)]
*  here, Maria. I want to zero in on this meeting that Xi Jinping had with Arab leaders. Tell [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=60.760000000000005s)]
*  me the significance of this meeting and the significance of him now talking more about [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=66.44s)]
*  buying oil and gas from the Saudis with the Chinese Yuan. Yeah, well, first of all, President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=70.92s)]
*  Xi was always going to have a relationship with Saudi Arabia and the Middle East. He's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=77.68s)]
*  completely dependent on Persian Gulf oil, 62 percent, and he's the world's largest importer [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=82.16s)]
*  of oil writ large. But what is actually happening here, because the Biden administration's missteps [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=87.64s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and the Arabs in general and going immediately to appease Iran at the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=94.2s)]
*  beginning of the administration, the Chinese clearly recognize that there's a vacuum here [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=98.72s)]
*  and they want to fill it. And the Arabs also recognize that they're not sure the United [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=105.44s)]
*  States is going to be there for them as they have been in the past. This is a relationship [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=110.0s)]
*  that goes all the way back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt at the end of World War Two. And [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  we've always had issues with Arabs, human rights and the differences with the United [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=120.47999999999999s)]
*  States. But our national security took precedence. What we're seeing here, Maria, President [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=125.28s)]
*  Xi met with the regional leaders of the entire Middle East and North Africa, some 20 something [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=130.2s)]
*  nations. This is a slight paradigm shift that's beginning to take place here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=136.24s)]
*  And it says strategic significance that a lot of the media is missing. It wasn't just a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=141.44s)]
*  meeting with Mohammed bin Salman from Saudi Arabia. He hosted this regional summit, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  something similar that President Trump did in 2017 when he met with the regional leaders [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  being hosted by Mohammed bin Salman. We've come a long way since July of 2017 [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=158.56s)]
*  because this relationship between the United States and the Arab world is tarnished. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=165.84s)]
*  I have one recommendation here for the administration. Work with the incoming Prime Minister of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=170.16s)]
*  Israel, Prime Minister Netanyahu, who wants to strengthen and expand the Abraham Accords. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=176.04s)]
*  That means relationship with Arabs and Israelis. Work with him and have him help you renew the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=182.51999999999998s)]
*  relationship with the Arabs. Yeah. Yeah, we were all wondering if, in fact, the Saudis would [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=189.04s)]
*  join the Abraham Accords. One thing that really struck me, General, was the fact that I see that [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=193.68s)]
*  the Saudis have agreed to contracts with Huawei. They're going to put to work Huawei telecom [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=199.28s)]
*  equipment in various places throughout Saudi Arabia. Does that mean that the Chinese Communist [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=205.84s)]
*  Party is now spying on the Saudis? Oh, there's no doubt about it. Probably already have been [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=212.16s)]
*  as much as they're penetrating the United States civil society in a way that no other country ever [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=219.68s)]
*  has. China is the most prolific at this worldwide and Saudis made, I think, a strategic mistake there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=224.56s)]
*  They did it to accommodate the Chinese in terms of the relationship, obviously. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  Wow. All right. We want to talk about the NDAA and the money being allocated for the military. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=236.32s)]
*  We'll take a short break and come back with that. I'm talking with retired four-star general [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=241.68s)]
*  Jack Keene this morning. A lot to get to in foreign policy. Stay with us. Welcome back, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=245.52s)]
*  and I am back with retired four-star general Jack Keene. General, I want to ask you about the news [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=249.76s)]
*  of the day. A Libyan man accused of being involved in making that bomb that destroyed Pan Am Flight [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=254.0s)]
*  103 over the town of Lockerbie is now behind bars in U.S. custody. Your thoughts? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=261.68s)]
*  You know, a tremendous commendation to our intelligence services and the FBI for [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=268.08000000000004s)]
*  their persistence. I mean, this is over three decades in the hunt for this guy, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=274.56s)]
*  and we finally got him, and enormous credit to do something like that. And it's got to be a huge [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=279.36s)]
*  relief also for the families. I mean, the suffering that they've gone through all of these years and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  not having anybody truly held accountable for this horrific act that was committed against their [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=291.04s)]
*  family members and loved ones. Finally, we have an answer for that despicable act. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=296.48s)]
*  General, what about overall readiness in our military? We just heard from Marsha Blackburn [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=302.32s)]
*  as the Congress right now is working on the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=306.56s)]
*  How would you assess the money being earmarked for the Defense Department and our military? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=312.32s)]
*  Well, first of all, we've got to give credit in the House. Bipartisan support in the House [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=319.04s)]
*  did something that's pretty unusual, and that is increase the president's budget by $45 billion. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=323.28s)]
*  And obviously, the majority in the House are the Democrats, and that wouldn't get done without [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=331.11999999999995s)]
*  their support. So credit to the Democrats and Republicans in doing that, and shame on the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=335.44s)]
*  president's administration for the rhetoric on China. This is our pacing challenge. This is our [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=341.67999999999995s)]
*  number one threat, but the budget doesn't reflect it. And this budget even is limited. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=347.6s)]
*  There's a lot of good things in this budget, to be sure, Maria. One of the things, it's 8 percent over [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=353.04s)]
*  FY22 budget. But the problem is, that's about the size of inflation. So this is a flat budget. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=359.20000000000005s)]
*  There's no real growth in this budget, despite the goodness that's in it. What we need to really do [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  is buckle down and see the threat for what it is. It is danger to us. In the Indo-Pacific region, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=371.44s)]
*  where China has more ships, more airplanes, more offensive and defensive missiles than we do, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=378.32s)]
*  the only advantage we have is in submarines. So we are outgunned and outmanned, and we have to move [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=384.48s)]
*  with a sense of urgency and have a budget that reflects the danger here. Simply what we're trying [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=390.32s)]
*  to achieve is make certain that President Xi and his military, when they look at the U.S. and our [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=396.56s)]
*  allies in the region, that they do not want to enter into confrontation over Taiwan because they [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=402.88s)]
*  know we would impose significant cost on them. We don't want them to look at us, Maria, and see [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  that they have the military advantage, and that's an incentive for them to take action. And that is [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=414.88s)]
*  where we are right now. It's got to get fixed. And this budget is a step in the right direction, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=421.2s)]
*  but so much more needs to be done. Really dangerous to have a flatlining of defense spending. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=427.44s)]
*  Real quick on Mr. Whelan, why was he left behind, a Marine left behind in this prisoner swap? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=435.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, these are frustrating to be sure. You've got mixed emotions, certainly. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=443.59999999999997s)]
*  We all feel good about Brittany Greiner being out. We don't like the idea who we had to give up to [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=447.68s)]
*  do that. These swaps are awful. They're always usually one-sided, to be sure. But with Whelan, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=452.88s)]
*  what's happening is the Russians want a guy who's an FSB colonel, who's a spy in Germany. They want [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  him out. And that hasn't been able to get worked out yet. General, thank you. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=464.56s)]
*  Most compelling analysis. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AL9o860AxUU&t=477.04s)]
