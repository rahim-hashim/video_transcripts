# 'Squad' Dems face new backlash: 'A complete disgrace'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow)
*  Jason Smith joins us now out of Missouri, House of Wayne's committee chair. I understand your [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=0.0s)]
*  committees could meet, but you guys just couldn't move any legislation and you spent so much time [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=6.16s)]
*  in the room trying to pick a speaker. You lost a lot of ground, Congressman, didn't you? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=10.4s)]
*  That's exactly right. We wasted 22 days of time on the floor to be doing our appropriations bills. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=15.36s)]
*  We have the deadline of November 17th for government funding to happen, make sure that it's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=21.84s)]
*  fiscally sane funding, but we're going to the work on it today. In fact, we're doing the energy and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=28.8s)]
*  water appropriations bill on the floor. So Speaker Johnson has hit the ground running. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=35.36s)]
*  I'm extremely thrilled that every member of the House Republicans voted for him and brought him [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=41.2s)]
*  up. He's someone who I had the privilege, Brian, to nominate to become the chairman of the Republican [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  Senate committee, which is the largest conservative caucus within the Republican conference. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=55.44s)]
*  That was back in 2018. I looked at Mike and I saw what a great leader he is, a man, a principal, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=62.08s)]
*  a true strong conservative, and gets along with everyone. He brought all the different groups [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=68.4s)]
*  within our conference together, and that's why he's Speaker of the House. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=76.72s)]
*  Right. Personally, I'm just on an outside of you work, but I always like Kevin McCarthy. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=79.92s)]
*  Are you guys going to remove, and I like Mike Johnson too, obviously, but what's there not to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=84.32s)]
*  like? But number one is, are you going to try to remove that one person move to vacate? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  I think we should, Brian. I think that it's a very toxic tool that's there. We don't need to [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=96.16s)]
*  ever get where we have been the last 22 days. The fact that eight Republicans could join in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=102.24s)]
*  with 100% of the Democrats and remove the Republican speaker and create chaos for 22 days, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=108.72s)]
*  that's reckless, and we should not allow that tool to be there. But in order to change that rule, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=115.28s)]
*  Brian, we have to have 217 votes, and eight of those people, I don't think they're willing [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=120.0s)]
*  to change the rules. Might be worth visiting. Here we go, though. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=126.24s)]
*  Couple of things. We know how conservative he is. You have 18 members in your caucus. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=131.12s)]
*  There were in districts that Joe Biden won. So in the matter, if you come out too conservative, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=137.76s)]
*  you're never going to get elected. So is he going to be able to keep that in mind [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=142.32s)]
*  when things like impeachment come up or a continuing resolution or shutting down the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=146.88s)]
*  government, things that traditionally purple states or blue states don't like? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=151.44s)]
*  One of the things that was so great about Speaker McCarthy is that he's been in every one of our [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=157.84s)]
*  congressional districts. He knows the issues that are at hand. Mike Johnson hasn't, but he's going [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=163.76s)]
*  to have to step up to the plate and learn it. There's a huge political side of being Speaker [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  of the House, and he's got a lot of work for him. But you know what? Every member of this conference [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  has to step up. I went to 86 congressional districts last year to help win the majority. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  Every member is going to have to step up and make sure that we win those 18 Biden won districts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=186.0s)]
*  And also add more. There's a couple seats we can pick up in North Carolina, Brian. We might lose [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=193.28s)]
*  some in New York because they're doing a new redistricting up there. But the redistricting in [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=199.12s)]
*  North Carolina looks very favorable. So we just got to keep pressing ahead. We have to make sure [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=203.44s)]
*  we have the right candidate. That's the most important thing is have the candidate that reflects [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=210.16s)]
*  that district. Because what works in Cape Girardeau, Missouri does not work in Palm Springs, California. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=214.96s)]
*  100%. I just say I find it unbelievable that people don't understand that the diversity of [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=222.72s)]
*  our country, diversity of a party, the different school of thought doesn't make you a bad person, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  especially if it's in your own party. But I know I'm speaking to the choir there. A couple of things [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=233.52s)]
*  you should know in New York. It's over 64 over 60% of New Yorkers do not want the redistricting. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  And it is going up to a higher court. So we'll see if it's going to happen again. Remember, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=244.72000000000003s)]
*  Lee Zeldin got within seven. Do you know the latest CNN poll has Donald Trump within nine [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=249.2s)]
*  points of Joe Biden in a state that a Republican hasn't won in 40 years because of how illegal [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=253.44s)]
*  immigration has overrun the streets of New York to the tune of 130,000 people without jobs who [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=260.64s)]
*  were feeding clothing and doing their laundry? Brian, people are fed up. When you travel anywhere [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=267.59999999999997s)]
*  in this country, they talk about the border. They see how reckless it is to allow it to be [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=275.52s)]
*  porous where millions of people, more people have crossed the southern border than the entire [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=280.88s)]
*  population of my home state of Missouri. That is an absolute disgrace. We have to secure our borders. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=286.15999999999997s)]
*  There's so many aspects. Inflation has gone up 17.9% since Joe Biden took the oath of office. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  And that means every American is paying more to put food on their table, clothes on their backs, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=300.79999999999995s)]
*  and gasoline in their cars. That is why they're fed up. That's why Joe Biden is in trouble in [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=305.2s)]
*  reelection. Congressman Jason Smith, our guest. But Congressman, I saw today the economy is growing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  almost at 5%. And yet, Bidenomics remarkably unpopular. The president's got 32% approval [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=315.2s)]
*  rating when it comes to the economy. But if you have low unemployment and an economy growing like [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=321.2s)]
*  that and inflation as high as it is, and industry as high as it is heading down, why is it that the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  numbers don't result in Democrats or Americans feeling that the economy is good? Why do you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=331.6s)]
*  think that is? Why are the numbers going against public sentiment? Look at real Americans. Talk to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=337.68s)]
*  real Americans. None of them would buy that the economy is growing at a successful rate, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=344.08000000000004s)]
*  because those folks are struggling. They have lost two months of their salary just because of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=348.56s)]
*  inflation since Joe Biden's taken the oath of office. That means they have less disposable [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=355.52000000000004s)]
*  income to be able to provide for their family. And so you can say all that you want, but you [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=360.56s)]
*  talk to real Americans, they're facing it every day and they're not buying this. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=366.96s)]
*  Yeah, so it's really strange. But that's why the president tried to spend the whole summer [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=372.24s)]
*  running on Bidenomics and got the Heisman. Nobody wanted any part of it. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=377.2s)]
*  Brian, I'd encourage the president to come to my field hearings. The House Ways and Means Committee [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=383.12s)]
*  has been having field hearings all over this country, whether it's Yukon, Oklahoma, Kimball, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=387.12s)]
*  Minnesota, Staten Island, New York, or Peachtree City, Georgia, hearing from real Americans, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=391.36s)]
*  working-class families, small businesses who are just doing everything they can to get by. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=397.04s)]
*  We have allies in the Middle East, but none like Israel. And for some reason, this anti-American [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=402.4s)]
*  sentiment from this next generation seems to have found Palestine as their new golden child, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=408.56s)]
*  which doesn't exist, by the way. Palestinians exist, Palestine doesn't. If they understand [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=415.12s)]
*  the region, they'd understand why. But listen to what we witnessed. Thousands come out, walk out [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=419.92s)]
*  of their colleges and schools, many of with teachers and professors, to protest against [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  Israel despite the fact that they just lost 1,400 of their citizens, including 791 civilians. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=430.48s)]
*  Listen to this, cut 14. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  Let this be a reminder that Palestine has been occupied for 75 years. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=440.8s)]
*  When Palestine is under attack, what do we do? Stand up like that! [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=447.44s)]
*  When Palestine is under attack, what do we do? Stand up like that! [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=451.76s)]
*  Here's more from NYU, cut 13. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=456.56s)]
*  From the river to the sea! Palestine will be free! [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=458.8s)]
*  Do you think this is the West Bank? No, it's the West side of New York City. The other one, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=467.91999999999996s)]
*  the first one was the University of Minnesota. You're sickened by this like I am. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  To say I'm disgusted by statements of support for Hamas that we've seen in recent days is an [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=480.32s)]
*  understatement. Celebrating, excusing, or downplaying the horrific rape, torture, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=487.28s)]
*  and murder of innocent people is the same thing as supporting violence or even calling court. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=494.64s)]
*  It's absolutely unacceptable that these universities have not disavowed what's [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=499.52s)]
*  happened just this week alone, Brian. George Washington University right here in Washington, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=505.28s)]
*  D.C., you saw a group of pro-Palestinian students that projected on the library that's named after [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=511.12s)]
*  two Jewish donors. Glory to our martyrs. Glory to our martyrs. What did George Washington University [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=518.56s)]
*  do? Nothing. They did not disavow that. Let me tell you, being over the Ways and Means Committee, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=526.4s)]
*  we have jurisdiction over all tax policy. That's why we need to haul in these universities, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=532.4s)]
*  look at their preferential tax treatment, because there should not be preferred speech, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=538.0s)]
*  freedom of speech, but not preferred speech. And if you do preferred speech, there needs to be [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=543.68s)]
*  actions that you are held to. So Donald Trump came out and said, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=548.7199999999999s)]
*  if you're American and you're pro-Israeli and you're Jewish, you should not be voting for [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=552.64s)]
*  Democrats. And they thought that was the worst thing they ever heard. It's a fact. Now, yesterday [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=557.4399999999999s)]
*  there was a resolution passed to support Israel. There was a resolution backing Israel, his first [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=562.4s)]
*  move as speaker. And guess what? Ten Democrats didn't vote for it. Bowman, Bush, Corey Bush, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=568.96s)]
*  Andre Carson, Al Green, Summer Lee, Thomas Massey, AOC, Thomas Massey, Republican, that's shocking, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=576.24s)]
*  Elon Omar, Congressman Ramirez, Rashida Tlaib, Present, which is just gutless, Joaquin Castro, [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=583.12s)]
*  Cesar Garcia, J.A. Powell, Presley, and Velasquez. How does that happen? It's the simplest vote you'll [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=591.12s)]
*  ever make in your life. And you have ten, you have seven right for a president and ten vote against [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=598.08s)]
*  it. Those nine Democrats are a complete disgrace. Corey Bush comes from my home state. She advocates [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=604.64s)]
*  defunding the police. Still does. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=614.0s)]
*  In the city that she, yeah, in the city she represents, Brian, in my home state, per capita [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=615.5200000000001s)]
*  has more murders than anywhere else in the United States. These people are not rational. They want [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=621.2s)]
*  to destroy our society and they promote propaganda that is as fake news as you possibly can find. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=627.76s)]
*  The fact that they're harboring and supporting terrorists who have killed more Israel, more [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=635.52s)]
*  people, more Jewish people since the Holocaust is absolutely unacceptable. And these people do not [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=641.12s)]
*  deserve to serve in the halls of Congress. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=649.2s)]
*  Congressman Smith, last question, just the mechanics of it. You only, you got about two [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=651.28s)]
*  weeks to come up and fund the government and get something out. They attend appropriations bills [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=655.76s)]
*  to the Senate. My, the word that I was getting, but you would know better, is that Republicans [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=660.72s)]
*  were fighting with Republicans on these appropriations bills. That was the holdup. It's not that you guys [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=665.4399999999999s)]
*  were on vacation. What could you tell us about this? [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=670.48s)]
*  Funding of government is extremely important. We have to do it by November 17th, just like what you [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=675.2s)]
*  said, that has been a topic of conversation. There's some Republicans that want to spend more [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=679.84s)]
*  than what was agreed to in the fiscal responsibility act back in May, that debt limit, the debt limit [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=685.76s)]
*  agreement that was brokered by speaker McCarthy and Joe Biden. We can't allow this reckless spending [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  to go unchecked. We need to have fiscal sanity in the appropriations bills that we bring forward. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=702.1600000000001s)]
*  Feel very confident about the leadership of speaker Johnson and helping navigate us through [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=707.84s)]
*  these waters. But we, it's not just Democrats. It's also some Republicans that we have to look [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=712.16s)]
*  at in this chamber. No, that's what I was talking about, that you guys are arguing with each other [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=716.96s)]
*  on spending, especially. And that's the why Kevin McCarthy couldn't get across all the appropriations [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=720.72s)]
*  bills done, because you guys couldn't agree. It's not that you weren't working. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=727.4399999999999s)]
*  It's exactly right. We've been focused on appropriations process since May. And May is [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=731.12s)]
*  when we got the fiscal numbers that we're supposed to be living by. But for example, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=737.12s)]
*  just in the last 10 days, this administration is proposing more than $175 billion of supplemental [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=741.52s)]
*  spending. That's not even funding government. This is new money. And guess what? Less than 10% [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=748.08s)]
*  of that 175 billion actually goes to Israel, our greatest ally in the Middle East. The rest goes [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=754.08s)]
*  towards domestic programs and also Ukraine. Yeah, we'll see. Where do you stand on Ukraine funding? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=761.04s)]
*  Let me tell you, I voted for Ukraine funding when it first started, but I haven't voted for it [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=768.08s)]
*  since. I feel like that the Ukrainians need to be held accountable on how they have spent that money. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=773.76s)]
*  And to this date, they have not provided it to Congress. If they could provide a solid audit [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=779.28s)]
*  system that you are comfortable with, you appreciate the mission. You just want accountability. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=784.16s)]
*  We absolutely have to have accountable of US tax dollars. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=789.44s)]
*  Got it. Congressman Jason Smith, thank you. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWeMWN8E5Ow&t=792.8s)]
