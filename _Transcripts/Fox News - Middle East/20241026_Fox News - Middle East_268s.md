# US 'created the problem' that Israel has to now go solve, retired gen says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo)
*  Honored to have Brigadier General Rob Smollin with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=0.0s)]
*  War Without Rules is a best-selling, right-of-way best-selling book. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=4.04s)]
*  And I was thinking of you, General, knowing there are no rules for what's going on now [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=7.140000000000001s)]
*  with this particular war, this tit-for-tat where one country makes a move, then the expectation [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=11.18s)]
*  is that the other country responds. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=16.14s)]
*  And there's no closure to that. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=18.52s)]
*  What do you think this latest move by Israel triggers Iran to do? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=21.14s)]
*  Because it's promised some response. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=25.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, they've already attacked Israel, so I'm not sure how much more they can respond [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=27.96s)]
*  or have a wider war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=36.04s)]
*  You know, it just brings me back to other things that are going on right now. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=37.04s)]
*  So we have not nearly put as much pressure on Zelensky to stop the war with Russia as [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=41.3s)]
*  we put on Netanyahu to stop the war with Iran. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=47.66s)]
*  And then look at this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=51.84s)]
*  We know that we need to go after those nuclear sites. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=53.8s)]
*  We know that Israel has to respond, and yet we're restraining the Israelis from going [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=56.78s)]
*  after the nuclear sites in Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=61.7s)]
*  So I just have to wonder, what is our strategy here and what are we trying to achieve? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=64.3s)]
*  Israel is going to strike Iran. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=69.34s)]
*  We know that. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=70.54s)]
*  Why would we not take advantage of that? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=71.54s)]
*  Now for the length of the attacks, I believe almost four hours had ended shortly before [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=75.26s)]
*  in that region, we're told that they were really targeting these Iran-Russian-made S-300 [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=81.34s)]
*  air defense systems. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=88.82s)]
*  But to your point, General, not going after key military and or nuclear sites, Donald [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=91.1s)]
*  Trump had said that that would be a mistake. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=97.74s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  And I think there's something more important, that point that Donald Trump made in his podcast [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=105.10000000000001s)]
*  with Joe Rogan. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=111.9s)]
*  He said, hey, look, Iran was broke. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=112.9s)]
*  Iran was broke. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=116.02000000000001s)]
*  And that was something that the United States did. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  So instead of being broke now, they are very wealthy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  And, oh, by the way, they were forced to... [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=122.14s)]
*  We told the Chinese, if you buy a single barrel of oil from the Iranians, you will not be [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=124.76s)]
*  able to trade with the United States. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=130.3s)]
*  And so Iran was isolated. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=133.0s)]
*  They were broke. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=134.8s)]
*  And then the Biden administration came in and turned it all off. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=136.0s)]
*  So in addition to the things that I just noted, we've created the problem that Israel has [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=139.06s)]
*  to now go solve. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=144.76s)]
*  So what happens in terms of reaction from more moderate Arab countries? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=147.74s)]
*  In that negative way, some of them have condemned Israel for this move, but not loudly or even [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=152.36s)]
*  very angrily. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=158.7s)]
*  I'm wondering if it was just a politically correct, almost to be expected response when [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=159.73999999999998s)]
*  you've reminded me, General, that some of these countries hate Iran more than Israel [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=165.56s)]
*  does. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=169.14s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=170.14s)]
*  And if you had cameras in the private spaces where those leaders are, it would look like [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=171.14s)]
*  the end of a soccer game, seeing those bombs go off in Iran. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=176.62s)]
*  They'd probably be shooting AK-47s in the sky and just laughing and triumphing because [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  Israel was actually going after Iran. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=186.85999999999999s)]
*  They don't like the Iranians any more than Israelis do. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=189.54s)]
*  So where do you see this going? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=194.22s)]
*  If Iran plans, and I'm just taking it from their foreign minister that is looking at [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=196.01999999999998s)]
*  some calculated response. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=200.94s)]
*  To your point, Israel was responding to that missile attack back on October 1st. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=202.62s)]
*  But this is what I see happening, a new pattern here, where it never ends because there's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=207.34s)]
*  a response to the response and then a response to that response unending. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=212.82s)]
*  And I think that's the whole point, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=218.9s)]
*  I think if we have an induction that's coming up that goes one way, we're going to continue [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=220.70000000000002s)]
*  to see a never-ending series of wars in the Middle East, in Europe, in Asia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=225.86s)]
*  That's what we've seen. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=231.74s)]
*  It just continues to escalate and doesn't really, it never ends. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=232.74s)]
*  Or it goes another way and perhaps it does come to an end because we start to dry up [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  the money that's financing these wars and we stop to supply money into them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=242.1s)]
*  So, you know, it's our strategy. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=247.98s)]
*  We can do what we want with it and either we're going to work to stabilize things or [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=250.94s)]
*  we're going to continue to have chaos like we do today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=257.1s)]
*  General, I have a very good seeing you, sir. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=259.74s)]
*  Thank you for joining us and thank you for your incredible service to this wonderful [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=263.38s)]
*  country. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=266.58s)]
*  Appreciate that even more. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HEidadwYewo&t=267.58s)]
