# Israel is willing to do what we would do: John Ratcliffe
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM)
*  All right, the planned ground invasion, as John just mentioned, of Gaza has been delayed since Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=0.0s)]
*  But why? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=4.4s)]
*  Well, the Jerusalem Post says it's because the IDF hasn't done anything like this in decades. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  And rushing in unprepared could be a very big mistake. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=10.68s)]
*  So what intel could they be seeing that's giving them pause? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=14.52s)]
*  Here now to discuss the possibilities, John Ratcliffe, former director of national intel under President Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=18.84s)]
*  John, I know we don't know for sure, but what do you suspect is going on here? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=24.16s)]
*  I suspect that the Israelis are balancing, you know, responding quickly versus responding smartly. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Laura, everyone knows that there's going to be a ground incursion by the Israelis into Gaza. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=37.04s)]
*  And it's sort of like, you know, if you're playing chess and you're telling everyone ahead of time where your rook is going on the chessboard, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=41.44s)]
*  your adversaries know and will make plans accordingly. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  And in this case, you know, what Israel has to has to deal with is they have multiple adversaries that are now planning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=50.88s)]
*  In the case of Hamas, the challenges are you have a, you know, a group that has already been willing to disregard the international warfare principle of distinction, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=56.92s)]
*  meaning that they're they're willing to treat civilians and combatants the same and hide among them and use hostages now up to possibly 250 as human shields. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  And they understand that as the number of civilians grow, Israel knows that the support that they have in the international community and even within the U.S. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  will fade. So they they need to plan for that. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=87.84s)]
*  And as John Roberts just talked about, the challenge is that they have an even more lethal opponent to the north and Hezbollah. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, unlike Hamas, Hezbollah has a sophisticated fighting force of one hundred thousand people. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=96.64s)]
*  They have one hundred and thirty thousand precision guided rockets and drones that have the capability of overwhelming Iran's. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=103.0s)]
*  I mean, Israel's primary defense system, the the Iron Dome. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=111.52s)]
*  And so, you know, I think that the Israelis are are are balancing these many challenges and making sure that when they move, that they they they move in the most strategically smart way possible. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  It's pretty hard, though, isn't it? Because there are two competing factors here. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=127.28s)]
*  The element of surprise is lost. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=131.23999999999998s)]
*  I mean, there is you can't have an element of surprise when you're obviously concerned about civilian losses, unlike Hamas, which indiscriminately kills women and children. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=134.44s)]
*  But Israel is actually concerned about that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  Right. So you lose the element of surprise. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=147.83999999999997s)]
*  Hamas knows you're coming. Meanwhile, Hezbollah to the north and Lord knows what else is going to come into play. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  Right. I mean, Israel's willing to do what we would do, which is to try and fight within the norms of international warfare. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=154.88s)]
*  And your adversaries are willing to disregard those. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=164.04s)]
*  And it puts you at that disadvantage. And they know that you're coming. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  And so, you know, it is a tremendous challenge. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=170.04s)]
*  And I think that's what that delay is is is attributable to. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  I want to, John, I want to get into the value of our Intel going to Israel at this point, because there have been some questions. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  About whether information that we had about a potential attack ever made its way to Israel, whether we had sufficient Intel on this. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  So there is some new reporting tonight that is claiming that the CIA Intel on this Hamas attack never reached Biden, saying that they were dismissed as routine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  And U.S. Intel agencies were focused on other international threats, primarily China, Russia, Iran, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  and that this strategic shift in priorities may have contributed to a lack of attention given to the intelligence on Hamas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  So the CIA might be trying to cover its you know what, John, but they're saying, you know, we said we saw this was going to come and they were distracted with other priorities. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=219.95999999999998s)]
*  It reminds me of what happened before 9-11. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=229.88s)]
*  I mean, it's similar, similar concerns. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=233.04s)]
*  Well, you know, I have talked with folks within the Intel community presently that have indicated that that unfortunately, the Biden administration may have redirected or retasked some intelligence assets away from the Middle East to Ukraine. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=237.44s)]
*  And I don't know whether that that is the case. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=253.12s)]
*  But but I do know this, you know, Laura, we both want the United States to be the the the ally that Israel needs right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=255.36s)]
*  But what's inescapable is the fact that, you know, national security adviser Jake Sullivan was on national TV doing a not so humble brag two weeks ago saying that the Middle East has never been quieter and he's spend less time on those issues than any of his predecessors in the last 20 years. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  And that is a whiff of epic proportions, because obviously, you know, just two weeks later, the Israelis, people have suffered the worst atrocities since the Holocaust. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=280.56s)]
*  And so, you know, the role that the U.S. should be playing, Laura, is that our best intelligence enterprise, our human intelligence, our signals intelligence, our geospatial intelligence should be working hand in glove with the Israelis to support them in what they need. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=290.88s)]
*  But I think there are real questions about our own intelligence, assets and capabilities as directed by this administration. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=306.0s)]
*  Well, I'm going to get into that in the angle, the competence of of the United States to even be involved here at some level. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=312.12s)]
*  But, John, invaluable insight. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=317.47999999999996s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PA0IKk1zM&t=319.35999999999996s)]
