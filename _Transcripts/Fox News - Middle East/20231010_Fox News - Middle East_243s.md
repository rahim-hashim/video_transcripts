# American living in Israel speaks out after family kidnapped in Hamas attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA)
*  Abby Ohn is an American living in Israel for the last eight years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=0.0s)]
*  She says her family members, from the ages of 12 to 80 years old, were kidnapped by Hamas. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=3.6s)]
*  And Abby joins me now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=10.44s)]
*  Abby, you are pleading for the return and say this is your worst nightmare. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=11.84s)]
*  Tell us what you know about what happened to your family members. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=16.84s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=22.12s)]
*  I wish that we knew more at this point, but, you know, we woke up Saturday to sirens and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=23.12s)]
*  began communicating with family members in the south and very quickly learned that Hamas [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=29.04s)]
*  had entered the country on foot and in many other ways, that there were thousands of terrorists. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=33.64s)]
*  And my family live on a kibbutz called Near Oz, which is very, very close to the Gaza [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=39.76s)]
*  border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=44.48s)]
*  And we understood that terrorists were in the house and around the kibbutz, and they [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=45.58s)]
*  could hear gunfire and they were in bomb shelters because of the rockets falling and the sirens [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=51.4s)]
*  blaring. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=57.72s)]
*  And we lost contact with them in the mid-morning. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=59.6s)]
*  And we know after that that the kibbutz was burned and many people were killed. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=64.08s)]
*  And it was a day later that we saw a video of our 12-year-old cousin in the hands of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=69.52s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=73.92s)]
*  We were just showing that video on the screen and it's horrifying. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=74.92s)]
*  How are you feeling right now? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=78.52s)]
*  I feel heartbroken. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=82.24s)]
*  I have a child the same age in the other room and it is any parent's worst nightmare. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=83.88s)]
*  It is inconceivable that this is happening in this day, in this time in Israel. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=90.19999999999999s)]
*  And I think for, as an American that's here, my cousin Carmela is an American. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=99.44s)]
*  These are her grandchildren. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=104.47999999999999s)]
*  This is her son-in-law. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  And I feel proud to be both American and Israeli. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=107.14s)]
*  I want people to understand that this isn't political. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=111.8s)]
*  These are humans. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=114.8s)]
*  These are people's grandparents and children and husbands and wives. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=115.8s)]
*  And you have a beautiful family. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=119.24000000000001s)]
*  We're showing their images. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  And you mentioned your cousin, Carmela Dan, 80 years old, who holds dual U.S.-Israeli [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=121.36s)]
*  citizenship. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=127.64s)]
*  Have you heard from anyone on the U.S. side, in the U.S. government? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=128.9s)]
*  We're doing everything we can to work with the government and the State Department. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=134.28s)]
*  I have amazing friends and family who are trying their best to make sure that we're [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=138.28s)]
*  following the protocol. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=141.92000000000002s)]
*  But I know, you know, I'm listening to the news and I know what's being said about the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=145.04s)]
*  release of hostages. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=149.88s)]
*  And I'm trying my best to stay optimistic and believe that there will be some sort of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=151.4s)]
*  diplomatic solution to this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=155.64000000000001s)]
*  Qatar is apparently speaking with Hamas and trying to negotiate that. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=156.96s)]
*  So is that giving you hope? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=160.72s)]
*  I am going to hold out hope until there isn't any, honestly. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=164.0s)]
*  You know, Abby, I absolutely hate to bring this up, but there is the reality of what [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=168.16s)]
*  Hamas is also saying about executing hostages. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=171.44s)]
*  If Israel goes in and, you know, executes a counter-strike. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=174.5s)]
*  When you found that out, when you heard that, what went through your head? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=180.28s)]
*  Heartbreak. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=184.4s)]
*  I'm doing my best to stay positive and optimistic and share the story with the U.S. because [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=187.04s)]
*  I think as a citizen, I know that I would want to hear from someone on the ground who [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=192.88s)]
*  can share the information and can share the truth and try less to pay attention to the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  news and the government and the military, the things that I really have no influence [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=202.88s)]
*  on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  And so I am going to believe that Israel has been here and done this before and they will [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  know the best way to save our citizens and our family. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=212.12s)]
*  And I just want Americans to understand that this is all of us. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=216.56s)]
*  This could be any of us and it's terrifying. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=220.92s)]
*  It absolutely is. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=223.2s)]
*  It could be any of us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=224.2s)]
*  Because of our close and beautiful relationship with Israel, this is an attack on the United [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=226.2s)]
*  States as well. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  Abby, you are so deeply and your family is so deeply in our prayers and our thoughts. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  Thank you for sharing your story. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=238.16s)]
*  You have a beautiful family and we hope that they come back to you safely. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=239.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=241.92s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=242.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RgPzfDy5ZNA&t=243.92s)]
