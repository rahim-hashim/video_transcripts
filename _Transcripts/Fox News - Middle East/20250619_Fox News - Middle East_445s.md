# We cannot 'sleep walk' into a nuclear-armed Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A)
*  Let's take a moment to look at the facts as they stand right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=0.0s)]
*  There's a lot going on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=3.84s)]
*  Israel, they control the skies over Iran and are hitting one military target after another. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=5.28s)]
*  They are hitting their nuclear facilities. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=10.96s)]
*  They've taken out their nuclear scientists. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=12.56s)]
*  They've taken out their top military personnel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=14.48s)]
*  They are pounding them around the clock every day, every night. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=17.16s)]
*  Meanwhile, Iran is getting desperate. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=20.28s)]
*  They are launching missiles now at civilian areas in Israel, worse than ever, as today [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=22.12s)]
*  they struck a hospital. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=28.54s)]
*  It doesn't get any lower than that. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=29.54s)]
*  But these attacks are weakening. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=31.7s)]
*  They're getting more disorganized as Israel now is hunting down, eliminating Iran's missile [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=33.5s)]
*  launchers and they're doing so successfully. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=39.5s)]
*  Also, indications tonight that Iranians may be running out of missiles and the batteries [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=42.42s)]
*  to launch them. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=48.14s)]
*  And as Jennifer Griffin just reported, there is a massive U.S. military buildup in the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=49.5s)]
*  region. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=53.82s)]
*  Now lining up at Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean, F-22 stealth fighter jets en route [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=55.5s)]
*  to the Middle East and numerous other military and naval assets have been in the area for [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=61.78s)]
*  weeks. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=67.14s)]
*  One thing seems pretty certain tonight and that is that the Iranian, quote, republic [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=68.14s)]
*  will not have a nuclear program at the end of this conflict and Israel may or may not [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=74.22s)]
*  Need our help taking out Iran's top secret, you know, Fodeu, Fordow, rather, nuclear facility [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=80.3s)]
*  deep inside under that mountain. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=87.05999999999999s)]
*  We have the Bunker Buster bombs that can do it, as we reported, and the stealth two bombers [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=89.1s)]
*  that can drop the massive payload without being detected over the skies in Iran. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Every military operation, we always pause. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=99.46s)]
*  It does have danger. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=102.36s)]
*  There's always danger. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=104.3s)]
*  When there's any military conflict, not the first choice, but they are the number [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=106.48s)]
*  one state sponsor of terror. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  They have killed Americans. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  We'll get into more details in a minute. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=113.76s)]
*  Now, it would be by far the best, most efficient way, meaning the Bunker Busters, to take out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=115.72s)]
*  this site, this remaining site at Fordow. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=121.52000000000001s)]
*  But in the end, I suspect it will be gone one way or the other. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=124.12s)]
*  And tonight, somewhat surprisingly, President Trump is still working on a more peaceful [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  solution. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  reports tonight from the White House. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=134.48s)]
*  There is a, quote, substantial chance for a diplomatic solution. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=135.48s)]
*  Now, keep in mind, Iran has zero leverage at this moment. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=139.2s)]
*  They have, in many ways, already lost the conflict. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=143.88s)]
*  They have no control of the skies of their own country. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  And as the president said, unconditional surrender and no weapons moving forward, that's got [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=150.78s)]
*  to be part of any deal, and that deal has to be made expeditiously. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=156.95999999999998s)]
*  While this would be the ideal solution, I'm not exactly sure they even know what the word [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=162.35999999999999s)]
*  peace means, and the world knows that the Iranians cannot be trusted. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=166.72s)]
*  Any signed agreement would need to include the immediate access and dismantlement of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=171.76s)]
*  their entire nuclear program. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=176.67999999999998s)]
*  Understand, they have no leverage at this moment, and that would include, by the way, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=179.0s)]
*  the Fordow site, and that has to be led by an American team of scientists, also including [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=183.64s)]
*  anywhere, any place, any time inspections. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=189.24s)]
*  Anything less than that would, frankly, be meaningless, and we'd be back to square one. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=192.44s)]
*  Now, if they agree to the most aggressive conditions, and I would add to that, they've [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=196.84s)]
*  got to give up their long-range missiles and any missile that would be in range of any [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=202.0s)]
*  installation that America has in the entire region. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  I guess if they could do that, their back is against the wall, but I would never trust [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=211.12s)]
*  these radical terrorists and extremists. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=215.56s)]
*  They are now desperate. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=218.68s)]
*  They are running out of time. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=221.16s)]
*  Now, regarding the ongoing situation in Iran, I know there has been a lot of speculation [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=222.16s)]
*  amongst all of you in the media regarding the president's decision-making and whether [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=227.72s)]
*  or not the United States will be directly involved. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=231.8s)]
*  In light of that news, I have a message directly from the president, and I quote, based on [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  the fact that there's a substantial chance of negotiations that may or may not take place [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=239.88s)]
*  I will make my decision whether or not to go within the next two weeks. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=245.72s)]
*  That's a quote directly from the president for all of you today. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=251.68s)]
*  All right, we can interpret within two weeks. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=254.68s)]
*  That could be hours from now, could be two weeks from now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=257.52s)]
*  As always, President Trump is not going to forecast the plan to the enemy, so if I were [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=260.74s)]
*  the mullahs of Iran tonight, I would act fast, because here's another simple fact that they [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=265.44s)]
*  need to comprehend and understand very deeply. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=270.42s)]
*  You can call it the Trump doctrine. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=273.84s)]
*  You can call it whatever the hell you want. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=275.61999999999995s)]
*  Well, the president rightfully hates war. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=277.46s)]
*  He does. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=280.38s)]
*  He prefers peace. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=281.38s)]
*  He gave them 60 days, and he has done everything he can do to avoid war. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=283.11999999999995s)]
*  He also has a backbone, and he's no isolationist, and he's proven that in the past. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  A president who took down ISIS, al-Baghdadi and his associates in his very first year [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=294.05999999999995s)]
*  without getting the United States into one of those long protracted wars that everybody [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=300.06s)]
*  keeps talking about. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=304.58000000000004s)]
*  It's a president that took out the number one terrorist of Iran, and that would be General [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=306.12s)]
*  Soleimani, sending a very clear message, again, without any protracted conflict. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=309.90000000000003s)]
*  It's also a president that used the mother of all bombs to take out the entire terrorist [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=315.66s)]
*  encampment in Afghanistan. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=320.98s)]
*  Do we forget that part? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=322.38s)]
*  The president has stated many times over and over again, Iran, he's been clear, there's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=324.1s)]
*  no ambiguity here. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=329.62s)]
*  Iran cannot have nuclear weapons, and that is the correct policy, or the world would [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=331.58s)]
*  risk a potential modern-day Holocaust, and that is not hyperbole. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=336.96s)]
*  Look at the hundreds of thousands of rockets over the decades that Iran or their proxies [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=342.26s)]
*  have fired into Israel, and how many Americans have they also killed over the years? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=347.62s)]
*  It simply cannot happen. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=352.98s)]
*  Now, they have been at war with us since 1979, 444 days, Americans held hostage. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=354.98s)]
*  They threatened to nuke the United States almost every year. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=362.90000000000003s)]
*  Now, when someone tells you who they are and what they plan to do, I would believe them, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=366.62s)]
*  especially with their history of fomenting terrorism worldwide. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=371.78000000000003s)]
*  This is something America learned the hard way. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=376.42s)]
*  After 9-11, remember the 9-11 Commission report, they were at war with us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=378.98s)]
*  We were not at war with them. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=383.84s)]
*  Put simply, we cannot sleepwalk into a nuclear-armed Iran. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=385.76s)]
*  The world, America, Israel, the entire region will be held hostage. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  Now, if there is a solution tonight that is emerging that can keep us out of this conflict [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=395.2s)]
*  with all of the things that I mentioned in terms of anyplace, anywhere, anytime inspections, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=400.71999999999997s)]
*  if they will give up their long- and short-range missiles, if they will give up their missile [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=406.52s)]
*  batteries, if they will allow American inspectors and scientists to dismantle the four-dose [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=410.52s)]
*  site, great, I am open to peace. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=416.52s)]
*  And President Trump is clear, he won't hesitate to act in the end because unlike Obama and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=419.68s)]
*  unlike Biden, I believe President Trump, through the ways I have mentioned, will always put [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=424.26s)]
*  the interest and security of you, the American people, first. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=429.38s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_luO9ZXMY1A&t=432.91999999999996s)]
