# Mayorkas’ actions are ‘totally inexcusable’: Sen. Josh Hawley
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20)
*  Is this typical of people who work at DHS? This is an asylum and immigration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=0.0s)]
*  officer who is posting these frankly pro-genocidal slogans and images on the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=5.58s)]
*  day that Israelis are being slaughtered in their beds. What have you done about [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=13.3s)]
*  this? Your question to suggest that that is emblematic of the men and women of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=19.36s)]
*  the Department of Homeland Security is despicable. I'm sorry, what have you done? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=25.9s)]
*  This person works for the Department of Homeland Security. Have you fired her? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=29.979999999999997s)]
*  You have employees who are celebrating genocide and you are saying it's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=33.86s)]
*  despicable for me to ask the question. Has she been fired? That individual has [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=38.14s)]
*  been placed on administrative leave. So she's not been fired. Well that was our [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=43.14s)]
*  next guest confronting President Biden's Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=48.019999999999996s)]
*  Mayorkas over anti-Semitic comments supporting Hamas posted by a Homeland [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=51.54s)]
*  Security officer on social media as Rich just mentioned. Missouri Senator Josh [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=55.74s)]
*  Hawley is a Republican on the Homeland Security Committee. Senator Hawley, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=59.86s)]
*  thanks for being on. Good morning. I want to get your reaction to that back and forth and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=63.9s)]
*  you know what you took away from that exchange. Well what I took away, Brett, is [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=68.78s)]
*  that this individual is still on the payroll of DHS which means that she's [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=73.42s)]
*  still getting paid with US taxpayer dollars. Here's what's equally [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=77.32s)]
*  concerning. She is an asylum and immigration officer who boasted on [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=80.3s)]
*  LinkedIn that she handles many, many refugee cases. I asked the secretary how [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=84.62s)]
*  many cases has she handled? Has she handled cases involving Jewish [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=89.74s)]
*  applicants? Has she handled cases involving applicants who may have ties [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=93.1s)]
*  to Hamas? And he wouldn't answer me. I said have you conducted a review of all [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=96.82s)]
*  of her cases? I think the answer to that is no. I mean this is really extraordinary [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=100.9s)]
*  to have this kind of a person on the payroll deciding these critical cases [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=105.78s)]
*  and DHS doesn't appear to be doing anything about it. Senator, you've [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=110.94s)]
*  grilled Secretary Mayorkas before on border questions. You've, I mean there's [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=114.61999999999999s)]
*  no love lost there. I think you've called for him to to step aside. After that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  exchange he had this response. Take a listen. Perhaps he does not know that I [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=125.12s)]
*  am the child of a Holocaust survivor. Perhaps he does not know that my mother [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=130.9s)]
*  lost almost all her family at the hands of the Nazis and so I find his [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=136.26000000000002s)]
*  adversarial tone to be entirely misplaced. I do not expect an apology but [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=143.46s)]
*  I did want to say what I just articulated. Did it change your perception [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=149.22s)]
*  after he said that? I find his evasiveness totally completely unacceptable [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=153.54000000000002s)]
*  and frankly the idea that he would try to insulate himself from accountability. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=158.98s)]
*  We're talking about people employed at his department. We are talking about [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=163.42s)]
*  people who are under his charge and his responsibility to the American public [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=167.66s)]
*  and yes to Jewish Americans who frankly Brett fear for their lives and to know [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=172.26s)]
*  that there is a pro terrorist pro Hamas sympathizer making immigration and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=178.22s)]
*  asylum decisions and to have no answer to that to have no response to have [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=185.42s)]
*  taken no meaningful action I think is totally inexcusable and he clearly had [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=190.14s)]
*  no answers yesterday. Senator great to have you on the show. I want to also ask [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=194.64s)]
*  you about the funding fight to come that is underway right now in Capitol Hill. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=199.17999999999998s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal writing this that the Biden administration has a [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=203.06s)]
*  spending choice guns or butter saying that Biden now wants Congress to help [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  allies win two wars abroad and deter a third over Taiwan yet he wants to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=211.22s)]
*  continue to spend on everything as if nothing in the world has changed. Do you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=216.62s)]
*  have ideas on where you would like to see some significant cuts in the budget [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=220.98s)]
*  if the wars are to get funded? Well listen I thought that the House's idea [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=224.7s)]
*  to immediately cut those 87,000 IRS agents who Biden never should have [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=229.02s)]
*  hired in the first place I thought that's a great idea. I'm all for cutting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=233.06s)]
*  the IRS and if we can use that money to help our ally Israel so much the better. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=235.78s)]
*  I'll just tell you in terms of our priorities Israel right now is facing an [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=240.14s)]
*  existential threat. Everybody agrees Israel needs aid. I think we should get [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=244.22s)]
*  that done immediately this week. Let's get that done then we can talk about [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=248.14s)]
*  Ukraine, the border, Taiwan, all the other things the administration [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=251.74s)]
*  administration's asked for. One other thing Dana I am a hard no on any [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=255.94s)]
*  funding for Gaza until every American hostage is home. That money will go into [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=260.58s)]
*  the hands of Hamas terrorists. They are holding our hostages. Those good [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=266.66s)]
*  Americans need to come home. It's interesting you bring that up. I don't [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  have it with me but I read this morning that Secretary Anthony Blinken writes an [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=274.14000000000004s)]
*  op-ed in the Washington Post saying that Israel needs the aid but he says that [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=278.06s)]
*  the humanitarian aid must go to Gaza as well and I can see your point right? So [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=281.62s)]
*  it's not as if the Brits were providing humanitarian aid to German civilians. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=285.26000000000005s)]
*  That's one of the analogies that has been made but there's going to be a lot [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=291.1s)]
*  of pushback on that. Is it possible that you could get this funding through with [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=294.82s)]
*  just the military aid to Israel? I think so. I think it is possible and I think [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=299.34s)]
*  that is the thing to do. Dana I think we need to aid our ally and partner Israel [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  right now. My position on Gaza is this that money will go into the hands of [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=308.05999999999995s)]
*  Hamas. Hamas is the effective government in Gaza. In fact just yesterday [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=313.46s)]
*  Secretary Blinken testified before the Senate that there would inevitably [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=317.29999999999995s)]
*  be some, I think he used the word spillage of the money, any aid to Gaza into the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=322.02s)]
*  hands of terrorists. Why would we do that Dana when they are holding our hostages? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=326.38s)]
*  You know Senator really quickly we had the ambassador to Ukraine on [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=330.58s)]
*  earlier and she said clear and simple if we don't support Ukraine Russia will win. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=335.38s)]
*  Do you agree with that statement and where do you think Ukraine funding is? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=339.9s)]
*  We have supported Ukraine Brett to the tune of a hundred and thirteen billion [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=343.58s)]
*  dollars. I am not in favor of additional funding to Ukraine particularly not when [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=348.22s)]
*  number one there is no watchdog tracking all of the money. We need an [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=352.78000000000003s)]
*  accounting of every dime that has been spent in Ukraine. The administration [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=357.3s)]
*  tells us they now have significant corruption concerns. Well let's see where [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=361.26s)]
*  our money is being spent. Number one. Number two our European allies have [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=364.22s)]
*  still spent far below particularly on military aid to Ukraine. Brett we've got [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=368.42s)]
*  to say to them that they must take the lead in defending Ukraine and in [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=372.7s)]
*  defending the European continent. We have to shift our focus militarily to [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=378.86s)]
*  the Pacific. We are gonna have to do that sooner or later. We need to level with [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=383.02s)]
*  them right now and say they have got to step up and take the lead. Senator [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=386.98s)]
*  Hawley we appreciate your time this morning. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2UMGbrAA20&t=391.09999999999997s)]
