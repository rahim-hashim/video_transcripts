# Terror cells may already be in the U.S., border expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ)
*  CBP reportedly warning Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists could be crossing the southern [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=0.0s)]
*  border as sources reveal there have been more than 23,000 known gotaways this month alone. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=6.08s)]
*  Our next guest has nearly three decades of immigration and homeland security experience. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=13.58s)]
*  Laura Reese is the director of the Heritage Foundation Border Security and Immigration [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=17.76s)]
*  Center and she joins us now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=21.98s)]
*  Laura, I just got to go straight to the numbers because I think they tell a great story and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=23.72s)]
*  not so great at the same time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=28.88s)]
*  So if you compare the fiscal year 17, 18, 19 and 20, you got two, six and three. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=30.56s)]
*  But if you go to fiscal year 23, you got 169 people that are on the terror watch list. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=39.16s)]
*  Should we be concerned? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=46.72s)]
*  Absolutely, because in addition to that number, we also have at least 1.6 million known gotaways. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  These were illegal aliens who purposely evaded the border patrol, gave up their free plane [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  ticket to anywhere in the U.S. because they didn't want to be fingerprinted. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=62.44s)]
*  So we have to assume among them are additional known or suspected terrorists, convicted aggravated [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=66.7s)]
*  felons, drug smugglers and human traffickers. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=72.52s)]
*  So we have to act like the sleeper cells are already here in the U.S. and preemptively [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=75.7s)]
*  find them and they should be detained. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=81.8s)]
*  So Laura, I guess the question is, why do the folks feel so comfortable coming now [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=84.54s)]
*  to our country illegally? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=90.22s)]
*  Because they know the border is wide open. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=93.10000000000001s)]
*  There's been foreign nationals from over 160 countries who've come through that border, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=95.18s)]
*  just why Joe Biden has been in president. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  The word has gotten out and they know that the open border policies are in place and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=103.14000000000001s)]
*  now is the time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=109.10000000000001s)]
*  So when illegal aliens get into the country, they call back home, they tell their family, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=110.22s)]
*  they tell their friends, they say now is the time, it's easy to get in. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=115.22s)]
*  And so the flow keeps coming. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=118.58s)]
*  So Laura, it's not just people on the terror watch list. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=121.06s)]
*  Apparently encounters of Chinese illegal immigrants at the southern border have surged over a [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=123.9s)]
*  thousand percent. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=128.42s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=132.26s)]
*  In 2020, a typical month would see about a thousand Chinese nationals at the border. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=133.34s)]
*  And just in September, that number has jumped to 7,000. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=140.7s)]
*  And the vast majority of them are single adults and most of them are male. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=145.14s)]
*  So given the number of ways that China, Beijing, spies on the U.S., we have to assume that [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=150.89999999999998s)]
*  there are Chinese spies that have come into the U.S. and again act accordingly. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=161.22s)]
*  Secretary Mayorkas of Homeland Security unfortunately has directed ICE to not arrest, not investigate, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=166.34s)]
*  not detain a lot of many of the illegal aliens here. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=174.3s)]
*  And Americans shouldn't wait for a terror attack to happen for the Biden administration [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=178.94s)]
*  to act. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=182.78s)]
*  I don't know what they're doing, but it's not smart. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=183.78s)]
*  I know they get these same numbers that we're reporting to our audience. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=187.22s)]
*  Let's just hope that they change before something happens. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=191.54000000000002s)]
*  Laura, thanks so much for joining the program today. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A7i5iKWrVIQ&t=193.98000000000002s)]
