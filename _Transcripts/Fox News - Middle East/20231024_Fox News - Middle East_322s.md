# White House rejects push to cancel visas for anti-Israel students
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs)
*  Some Republicans calling for student visas to be revoked for any protesters that are condemning Israel and sympathizing with Hamas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=0.0s)]
*  But the White House says it is not backing that idea. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=9.44s)]
*  I would just I would just tell you, you don't have to agree with every sentiment that is expressed in a free country like this to to stand by the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=13.36s)]
*  idea, the First Amendment and the idea of peaceful protest. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=22.92s)]
*  I'll leave it at that. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=25.72s)]
*  Outkick host Tommy Lahren joins joins us now, Tommy. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=27.16s)]
*  So there are some Republicans like Governor Ron DeSantis, who have said that student visas should be revoked for pro Hamas protesters. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=30.520000000000003s)]
*  He says it's an issue of national security. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=39.08s)]
*  But then you have John Kirby saying, listen, you can't do that in the United States. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=40.68s)]
*  Everybody has a right to protest and a right to free speech. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=43.96s)]
*  So how do you view this debate that's playing out this morning? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=47.36s)]
*  So, first of all, I am so happy to hear that the Biden administration supports free speech, although it be very selective. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=50.56s)]
*  We know that they're actively trying to fight a ruling right now that would keep them from colluding with big tech to censor Americans on covid and the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=58.88s)]
*  Hunter Biden laptop story. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=67.04s)]
*  So I'm happy to hear that now they've done an about face and they suddenly support free speech again. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=68.92s)]
*  It's funny how that always seems to work in their favor and their favor alone. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=73.68s)]
*  But I will say this. I'm a free speech absolutist. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=77.64s)]
*  I believe that you should be able to say what you want to say, even if it's ugly and disgusting, because I believe people should be able to know who you are. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=80.60000000000001s)]
*  And especially if you say disgusting and horrific things. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=88.32000000000001s)]
*  However, I do believe we draw a line when you have noncitizens advocating for terror organizations. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=91.36s)]
*  Todd and Carly, if you can have the FBI look into parents at school board meetings or the FBI surveil January 6th, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=98.68s)]
*  or parents who were just simply at the Capitol on that day, then certainly you can keep a watchful eye on noncitizens who are protesting in support of not Palestine or the free Palestine movement, but pro Hamas, anti-Israel, anti-Semitism, pro terror. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  Certainly that should be within our rights as a country and as the American people. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=121.48s)]
*  That seems like a fair argument when asked basically the same thing. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  KJP with a very long winded no comment. Listen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=129.36s)]
*  Does the president view anti-Israel protests and sentiment on college campuses as anti-Semitism? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=134.52s)]
*  So, look, I'm not going to get into what's happening across the country and at different universities. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=141.28s)]
*  Not going to get into the specifics. As the admiral said, the First Amendment, right? Right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=146.0s)]
*  That's what something and peaceful protest is really part of part of our democracy, being able for folks to to to be able to express their feelings. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=150.08s)]
*  I'm not going to get into any, you know, specifics on that. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  Quite a punt there from KJP there, Tommy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, again, they just cannot decide if they support free speech or they don't support free speech. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=168.6s)]
*  Again, I do believe that college campuses need to be home to dialogue and conversations and different opinions. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=174.56s)]
*  But there has to be a line when talking about terrorism. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=180.8s)]
*  KJP on that same day, though, went on to talk about Islamophobia and seems to think that anti-Semitism and anti-Israel sentiment really isn't a problem, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=183.56s)]
*  even though quite obviously it is, but that we should be focused on Islamophobia. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=192.4s)]
*  So the selectiveness that is coming out of the White House is really precise. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=196.36s)]
*  The only precise thing they do is pick and choose which rights and which Americans they want to protect. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=201.44000000000003s)]
*  Always an incredible balancing act. They should really compete in the mental Olympics. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, Tommy, Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, she's still speaking out. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  She's now a tripling down that Israel was behind last week's explosion at the Gaza hospital. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=213.32000000000002s)]
*  She said in a news statement, media outlets and third party analysts have raised doubts about claims and evidence offered by both Israel and the Gaza Ministry of Health. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  And I agree with the United Nations that an independent investigation is necessary. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=230.11999999999998s)]
*  I cannot uncritically accept Israel's denial of responsibility as fact. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=233.88s)]
*  It's not just Israel, though, Tommy, the Biden administration, France, the UK, Canada have all independently analyzed this data [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=238.88s)]
*  and come to the same conclusion that it was a rocket launched in Gaza that hit this parking lot near the hospital. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=247.12s)]
*  Yeah, she continues to repeat Hamas talking points. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=257.16s)]
*  So I think here's the lesson. Your vote matters. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=260.56s)]
*  When you go to elect somebody, especially in this upcoming election, make sure you know where they stand on issues like this. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=263.56s)]
*  Make sure that you understand when they are repeating terrorist groups, talking points and their narrative. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=269.8s)]
*  Make sure that you're aware of that and you can distinguish that because that is of the utmost importance. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=275.68s)]
*  The fact that we have members of the squad who many are calling the Hamas caucus right now for good reason. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  The fact that you have them out there repeating these talking points, being so blatantly anti-Israel and many would say anti-Semitic in some of the comments that they're making. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=287.68s)]
*  And especially when you have Congresswomen like Rashida Tlaib, Ilhan Omar, that are after being chased down, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=296.56s)]
*  won't tell you how they feel about beheaded or burned babies, but are so vocal about a false narrative, that really tells you something. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=302.52000000000004s)]
*  So protect your vote, my friends. This upcoming election is going to be very important politically, morally, professionally. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=309.8s)]
*  So make sure you choose wisely. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  Tommy Laird and on a Tommy Tuesday, we appreciate it as always. Thank you very much. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nw8nBn7dVWs&t=318.16s)]
