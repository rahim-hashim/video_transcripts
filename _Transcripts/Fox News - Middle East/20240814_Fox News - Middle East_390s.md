# 'Netanyahu has stepped up his game': Gen Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0)
*  With that, we bring in retired 4 star General Jack Keene, former Army Vice Chief of Staff, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=0.0s)]
*  now Chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=4.4s)]
*  General, always good to have you with us. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=9.4s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=11.52s)]
*  Let's put up on the wall here the weaponry that has been deployed to the Middle East [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=19.2s)]
*  It's an impressive array of American force. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=20.2s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  F-22 Raptors, F-18 Super Hornets, guided missile submarines and destroyers. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Tomahawk land attack cruise missiles and the USS Roosevelt and Lincoln carrier strike [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=29.56s)]
*  groups will now both stay very close in in this region. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  So General, the first question to you on this is will that work? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=40.68s)]
*  Is that a deterrent to Iran and does it give Israel the cover that it needs? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=44.4s)]
*  Well, a couple things. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=49.72s)]
*  Yes, we have thickened certainly the defense of Israel with the capabilities you just suggested. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=52.4s)]
*  The Lincoln strike group is en route, but take another week. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=58.56s)]
*  But if this escalates beyond a retaliation attack by Iran and we've got something more [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=62.56s)]
*  serious taking place, likely both strike carrier groups would stay in the region. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=68.4s)]
*  So the mission, you know, as stated by the Pentagon and the administration, is one to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=73.58s)]
*  make certain that the assets that are to defend Israel, and there's more of them, and I think [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=78.56s)]
*  the reason is they suspect through their own intelligence that they believe the Iran's [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=83.56s)]
*  attack will likely be larger than the 300 plus drones and missiles that they used the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=88.4s)]
*  last time will likely also involve to some degree their proxies, possibly Hezbollah for [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  sure, maybe the Houthis and the militia groups going after U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=100.76s)]
*  We don't know that, but I think our intelligence services probably have a pretty good feel [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=107.12s)]
*  for it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=111.94s)]
*  Whether it's going to deter Iran or not, I doubt that seriously. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=113.02s)]
*  And here's why. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=116.5s)]
*  Iran conducted an attack on April the 13th to stop Israel from killing its leaders, and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=118.25999999999999s)]
*  they killed a number of military leaders in Damascus on embassy grounds 12 days prior, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=124.7s)]
*  and that produced that attack. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=130.94s)]
*  And what has Israel done as a result of that? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=132.3s)]
*  They did a modest re-attack around a nuclear defense, a nuclear facility, an air defense [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=134.62s)]
*  system is what they took out. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=141.02s)]
*  I mean, that was a pinprick, obviously, done to send a message to Iran that we're not escalating. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=142.54s)]
*  But the truth is Netanyahu has stepped up his game, and it all stepped up after he came [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=150.01999999999998s)]
*  back from his visit to the United States. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=156.29999999999998s)]
*  He has gone after high-value targets, killing multiple leaders in Hezbollah and killing [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=158.62s)]
*  multiple leaders also in Hamas. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=163.66s)]
*  But most significantly, he took out the political chief of Hamas. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=166.34s)]
*  That's significant in itself. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=170.35999999999999s)]
*  But most significant is he took him out in a high-security zone, in a VIP guesthouse, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=171.7s)]
*  in a general vicinity where government officials live. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=178.42s)]
*  The message to Iran that Israel is sending, if I can kill a leader who's in your capital [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=181.54s)]
*  city on a temporary basis, I can kill your leaders who are there permanently. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=188.29999999999998s)]
*  He has penetrated their security forces. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=193.34s)]
*  Their security forces repressed the people, keep the regime in power. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=195.62s)]
*  This is significant for the supreme leader and his allies. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=199.86s)]
*  He has to make certain that his leaders are going to continue to support them, and they're [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  not unnerved by this. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=208.18s)]
*  So that is why this deterrence is not going to work here. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=210.10000000000002s)]
*  They are going to attack. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=214.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=215.9s)]
*  We'll see what that looks like in terms of the attack into Israel and where that goes. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=216.9s)]
*  I mean, I think all Americans are sitting up and taking a lot of notice to this. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=224.26000000000002s)]
*  When you see the movement of our assets into this region, obviously all those young men [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=228.66s)]
*  and women are attached to families here in the United States. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=232.62s)]
*  This is the question that Lucas Tomlinson just asked at the Pentagon briefing. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=240.38s)]
*  Don't you need to send a clear signal about what Iran, if they do it, if they cross it, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=241.38s)]
*  you will attack them? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=249.74s)]
*  I think we are sending an extremely clear signal, which is that we are going to support [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=250.74s)]
*  the defense of Israel. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=255.94s)]
*  If you do this, launch this major attack, the U.S. military will strike back. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=257.62s)]
*  Why can't you just clearly say that? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=262.97999999999996s)]
*  I think we've been very clear that we're going to support the defense of Israel, and I'm [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=264.41999999999996s)]
*  not going to speculate about potential future attacks by Iran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=271.5s)]
*  Quick reaction to that, if you could. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=272.65999999999997s)]
*  And then I want to squeeze in one more, if I can get it in general. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=273.65999999999997s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=276.38s)]
*  Well, the administration is not doing what Tomlinson is seeking. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=277.38s)]
*  He's talking about—have you told the Iranians that if you attack [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=283.38s)]
*  U.S. forces again—after all, they just recently wounded five soldiers and two contractors—we [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=287.06s)]
*  will attack you directly. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=292.86s)]
*  We haven't sent that message. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=295.18s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=296.86s)]
*  If we did, you would hear something different out of Ryder's mouth as a result of that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=297.86s)]
*  We have had hands-off Iran for the three-plus years and certainly hands-off Iran directly [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=303.02s)]
*  since October the 7th. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=309.26s)]
*  How likely President Biden recently said in an interview that he thinks there is a [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=310.74s)]
*  potential for ceasefire on his watch in the waning months of his presidency and the return [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=316.5s)]
*  of hostages, American hostages among them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=322.76s)]
*  How optimistic are you that that can happen in the near term? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=325.2s)]
*  Well, as long as Sinwar is still alive, I doubt it's happening. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=329.3s)]
*  He's rejected the idea that there should be some negotiations this week, Thursday, and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=335.74s)]
*  Israel was willing to participate. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=342.02s)]
*  And he is not. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=345.02s)]
*  And for the last seven or eight months, he has pretty much shut all of this down. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=346.02s)]
*  Why is he doing that? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=349.38s)]
*  Because he thinks time is on his side. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=350.38s)]
*  He's watching the Americans push back on the Israelis. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=353.42s)]
*  He's watching an arms embargo on the Israelis. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=356.02s)]
*  He's watching the international community push back. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=359.46000000000004s)]
*  What he sees all of that is strengthened in his side. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=362.4s)]
*  Yeah, I think a lot of people wonder why the administration and the vice president are [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=364.4s)]
*  tougher on Israel when it comes to this back and forth than they are on Hamas. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=368.92s)]
*  And so we'll continue to see where this goes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=375.32s)]
*  Very tenuous situation. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=377.48s)]
*  General, thank you very much. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=378.48s)]
*  Good to see you as always. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gEFR6_8kHr0&t=380.44s)]
