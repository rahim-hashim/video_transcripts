# 'HELL ON EARTH': Military experts explain how urban warfare poses tough challenges for the IDF
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU)
*  Let's bring in Hugh Dugan. He's a former special envoy for hostage affairs. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=0.0s)]
*  And Major John Spencer, he's the chair of the Urban Warfare Studies at the Modern War Institute. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=4.48s)]
*  John, what is it going to look like when this ground operation is underway? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=10.24s)]
*  It's going to look like hell on earth. I mean, you can't do the operation, the IDF need to do, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=17.44s)]
*  to pry those Hamas terrorists out of the cities of Gaza without being extremely destructive. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  We're already seeing that, but it's going to be a really tough challenge for the IDF to face them [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=28.0s)]
*  deep buried in the tunnels and in the bunkers and the rubble. It's going to be really, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  it's going to look like scorched earth, but the IDF follow the laws of war. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=39.76s)]
*  It's just what happens in urban warfare. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=44.0s)]
*  How restrained is the Israeli army being? They're catching all this heat from the international press. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=48.24s)]
*  Yeah, that's the tactic of Hamas. Hamas is, if I teach urban warfare, I use Hamas as an example of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=54.0s)]
*  using human shields, literally putting your people out to die in military targets so that way you can [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=59.44s)]
*  broadcast to the international media and cry for help. IDF is being extremely restrained. They're [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=65.44s)]
*  hitting military targets. I also teach what it takes to protect civilians. The IDF are telling [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  the civilians to leave. They're calling buildings before they strike it. They're dropping their [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=77.76s)]
*  calling buildings before they strike it. They're dropping leaflets. They're being restrained and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=81.68s)]
*  following the law of war. And when they go in, is this block by block, building by building? What [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  does that look like from the eyes of a soldier on the ground? It is the worst combat you could [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  ever ask a soldier to do. Millions of firing points that they could face and the enemy gets [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=99.68s)]
*  to pick when they shoot at you, but absolutely it's block by block, house by house, house bombs, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  snipers, underground bombs, RPGs from any direction. But there are a lot of challenges, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=110.24s)]
*  but having studied other militaries, one military specifically designed for that is the IDF. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=116.47999999999999s)]
*  All right, Hugh, we believe there's 150 hostages that Hamas has. They're probably underground in [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=124.08s)]
*  the tunnels. We believe some of those hostages are Americans. What does this negotiation, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=130.95999999999998s)]
*  if it is a negotiation at all, look like? Well, we know that there are 600 Americans who live in [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=136.56s)]
*  Gaza. We're not sure exactly the number in the tunnels or perhaps they're elsewhere. It would [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=142.56s)]
*  be very useful to know where they were and that's a tactic that the Hamas will use against us by [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=147.44s)]
*  moving them around perhaps, making it all the more difficult for us or the Israelis to launch any [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=152.24s)]
*  type of recovery effort. So there's a strong chance that as the Israelis are pounding Gaza [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=157.04s)]
*  and as they move ground forces in, Hamas is moving some of these hostages into the front lines. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=166.24s)]
*  Well, one hopes that they realize that hostages are, alive hostages, worth more to them than a [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=172.96s)]
*  dead one. And in all of our maneuvers and messaging, I hope that that message gets across, at least to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=179.68s)]
*  maintain the life of these people so that other developments might occur that could assist in [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  their recovery. What kind of leverage does Hamas have now that they have hostages, especially [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=191.92s)]
*  American hostages? Is this about money? Are they holding out for a truce? What exactly would their [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=198.32s)]
*  strategy be? They're building their brand, unfortunately. This is well worth it to them [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=205.27999999999997s)]
*  to demonstrate their ability to invoke pain on Israelis. They set out this big dragnet to [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=211.67999999999998s)]
*  take hostages. One doesn't know if they targeted Americans or not, but indeed they did take [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=217.68s)]
*  Americans with them. The end result is one of publicity, unfortunately, for their cause, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=222.8s)]
*  to create sympathy perhaps around the world. I think that's going to backfire. I think the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=229.76000000000002s)]
*  state sponsors who are sponsoring Hamas may have lost control and their proxies gone wild, perhaps [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  might make them think twice about what's going to happen on the ground and whether or not the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  Hamas are going to take it far too far for their sponsors to have anticipated. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=245.04s)]
*  Yeah, so these sponsors are basically waiting to see how things play out. They've already got a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=251.68s)]
*  message sent by the U.S. military, that's for sure. John, last question. How delicate is a dance [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=257.2s)]
*  when you have hostages, you're not sure the intelligence of where they're located, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=263.68s)]
*  in the middle of guerrilla warfare? I mean, very delicate. Hamas will use the hostages as [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=268.32s)]
*  shields again, but that won't stop the operation. Yeah, the more time you wait, the better time to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=276.08s)]
*  get the hostages back, but the tunnels that they're hiding them in are the worst condition [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  you could ever send, but I know some really highly specialized people that Hamas are about to meet. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=285.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, well, I hope they meet them and I hope they meet them soon. Gentlemen, thank you so much. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Op1XhTn0DIU&t=293.04s)]
