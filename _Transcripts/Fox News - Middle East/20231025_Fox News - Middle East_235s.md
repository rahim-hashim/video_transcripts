# KJP forced to walk back 'weak' statement on antisemitism
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U)
*  Thank you, Brian. This is a Fox News alert. At least two dozen United States military personnel injured in drone attacks on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=0.0s)]
*  American bases in Syria and in Iraq last week. The Pentagon now revealing Iran backed militias are behind the attacks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=7.16s)]
*  We know that the groups conducting these attacks are supported by the IRGC [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=14.5s)]
*  and the Iranian regime. What we are seeing is the prospect for more significant escalation [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=20.14s)]
*  against US forces and personnel across the region in the very near term coming from Iranian proxy forces and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=26.24s)]
*  ultimately from Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=33.28s)]
*  Israeli Special Envoy for Combating Anti-Semitism, Michael Cutler Wanch joins us now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=35.56s)]
*  Ma'am, thanks so much for joining the program. So they're attacking us as well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=41.68s)]
*  A lot of these folks that are on these bases are your partners. What's your reaction to the White House [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=45.04s)]
*  saying consistently that if we're attacked we will respond, but there hasn't been a response yet. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=52.0s)]
*  Well, October 7th changed the world as we know it and what we saw in those genocidal brutal attacks, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=57.92s)]
*  the murder, the rape, the bludgeoning, the burning of babies, what we saw is an attack on our shared humanity, on [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=64.84s)]
*  civilization. We know that Hamas is but one proxy of that genocidal regime in Iran that is now attacking [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=71.32s)]
*  American forces or that attacked American forces in the last couple of weeks and will continue to do so. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=78.2s)]
*  This is an assault on our shared civilization. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=83.36s)]
*  There is the war that is raging only on Israel's front at the moment, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  but it is at our shores and we see that the same anti-Semitic hate that fueled those atrocities are [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  actually right here on campuses, on social media, on streets, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=99.04s)]
*  not only in the United States, across Europe as well, that supports, that excuses, that justify [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=104.12s)]
*  those genocidal acts and so this war is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=110.72s)]
*  multi-dimensional and is on multi-fronts and that is the way that we should be combating it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=114.88s)]
*  MicaÃ«lle, Kareem Jean-Pierre at the White House, she had to walk back a very weak answer on the rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=120.08s)]
*  We have what she said on Monday and then she walked it back [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=126.64s)]
*  yesterday on Tuesday and we have those sound bites put together. Listen to this. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=129.84s)]
*  We have not seen [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=134.0s)]
*  any credible threads, but look, Muslim and those perceived to be Muslim have endured a disproportionate [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=136.08s)]
*  number of hate-fueled attacks. When Israel is singled out because of anti-Jewish hatred, that is anti-Semitism [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=143.4s)]
*  and that is unacceptable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=152.44s)]
*  There is no place for anti-Semitism, full stop, period. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=154.68s)]
*  She had to read it off of the paper, but what's your reaction? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=159.4s)]
*  Well, I mean if we just look at the library of the George Washington University from last night or at the day of rage that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=164.08s)]
*  Palestine students, Justice for Palestine students are calling for campuses for tomorrow, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=172.52s)]
*  endorsing, not only commending, but endorsing Hamas's charter, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=178.44s)]
*  clear and unequivocal call for the annihilation of the state of Israel and for the murder of Jews and we think that there is no [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=183.12s)]
*  rise in anti-Semitism as the FBI warns, as there is security upped in every single Jewish institution, as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=189.6s)]
*  Jewish students on campuses are targeted for their identities, then we have a really big problem and I want to be clear, the International Holocaust [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=196.56s)]
*  Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism that includes the demonization, the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=204.64s)]
*  delegitimization and the double standards against the state of Israel has been enabled on every single space, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=209.95999999999998s)]
*  university spaces, international institution spaces, social media spaces, and if we are not clear when the masks have been called off that [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=216.27999999999997s)]
*  anti-Zionism is the modern mutated form of anti-Semitism, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=223.48s)]
*  targeting Jews on the streets of the United States, then we will not be able to identify and combat it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=227.6s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mikhail. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Z3O4kbjl0U&t=233.0s)]
