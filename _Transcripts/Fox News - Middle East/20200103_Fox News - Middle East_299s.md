# Rep. Dan Crenshaw slams Democrat apologists over Soleimani strike
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw)
*  Let's bring in Dan Crenshaw now, member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=0.0s)]
*  former Navy SEAL himself, served in Iraq and Afghanistan, now serving in real combat in [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=3.96s)]
*  Washington as well, which is also physical and also very, I guess you could call it trench [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=7.96s)]
*  warfare. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=14.24s)]
*  First off, Congressman, are we safer with Soleimani dead? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=15.24s)]
*  First of all, thanks for having me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=18.68s)]
*  The answer is absolutely yes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=22.68s)]
*  Soleimani was responsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=25.64s)]
*  He planned, executed attacks on Americans, gave IEDs to Shia militias in Iraq that are [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=29.32s)]
*  responsible for over 600 American deaths. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=34.32s)]
*  Not to mention all the deaths around the region, Syria, Lebanon, Iraq, and elsewhere, the Houthi [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=37.4s)]
*  rebels in Yemen. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=43.32s)]
*  So this guy has been a force of destruction and death in the region for a long time. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=45.6s)]
*  He's the head of one of the largest terrorist organizations in the world, the Iranian Quds [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=51.2s)]
*  Force. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=56.84s)]
*  So yes, we are safer. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=57.84s)]
*  But are there any consequences? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=59.36000000000001s)]
*  Of course there would be. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=60.36000000000001s)]
*  I would fully expect the Iranians to plan some kind of retribution. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=61.92s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=65.84s)]
*  We have to just abuse ourselves of this notion that we should simply continue to take punches. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  Okay, Iran attacked our base recently. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=73.2s)]
*  Then they attacked our embassy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=75.96000000000001s)]
*  They fully supported the Shia militias that did attack our embassy and base. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=78.36s)]
*  Are we supposed to just let that happen? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=82.76s)]
*  And to say yes would be absurd. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=85.12s)]
*  And I don't understand when Americans become so fearful. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=87.16s)]
*  We've had countless people on the left tweeting out apologies and slandering our own government [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=90.08s)]
*  for taking action to kill a man who has killed Americans. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=95.08s)]
*  And I don't understand where this American self-loathing came from. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=99.72s)]
*  And frankly, thank God they're not in charge. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=102.52s)]
*  Congressman, across the aisle from you there are a number of Democrats. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=105.08s)]
*  We've actually got a tweet from Elan Omar. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=108.32s)]
*  She's asking what a number of Democrats want to know. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=111.03999999999999s)]
*  They want the president to explain what legal authority he used to carry out this attack. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=113.92s)]
*  We had the Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on with us a little while ago. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=120.3s)]
*  And he said it wasn't for what Soleimani has orchestrated so far. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=124.68s)]
*  It was what would happen in the future because they were plotting more attacks. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=129.84s)]
*  Yeah, well, I can certainly help them out with that. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=134.32s)]
*  OK, first of all, this was a strike that was in response to very recent strikes against us. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=137.96s)]
*  So there was a self-defense mechanism to this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=147.16s)]
*  Furthermore, it was preventive measures, Pompeo has pointed out. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  But furthermore, beyond that, this happened in Iraq against an enemy that attacked us in Iraq, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=152.68s)]
*  in which we have plenty of authorization to be operating in. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=158.4s)]
*  This is not an attack on the Iranians. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=161.4s)]
*  It's like saying that when there was foreign fighters in Iraq throughout the Iraq War, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=163.56s)]
*  that we should not have let our soldiers engage with them because we hadn't declared war [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  on that particular country that those foreign fighters were coming from. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=172.28s)]
*  That's an absurd thing to say. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=175.35999999999999s)]
*  And these members of Congress know that, or maybe they don't know that, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=177.2s)]
*  but Pompeo to tell them that. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=180.44s)]
*  And all this hand-wringing that they're doing certainly didn't occur during the Obama administration. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=182.44s)]
*  I wish they would just leave the hypocrisy aside, leave the partisanship aside. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  We need to come together. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=191.64s)]
*  We should be talking about, as a Congress, what authorizations we should give to the president, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=192.6s)]
*  just in case these scrimmages around the region continue to escalate. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=198.6s)]
*  The last thing we should be doing is looking to our past. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=204.0s)]
*  I'm friends with Tulsi Gafford. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=209.36s)]
*  But to say that what we should be doing is looking to our past and trying to analyze why this happened, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=210.44s)]
*  that's absurd. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=217.32s)]
*  That's a great academic argument. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=218.16s)]
*  But it doesn't help us in our current reality, where we have an enemy that does want to destroy us. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=221.16s)]
*  And we do have to deal with that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=226.12s)]
*  We can't look at historical textbooks to solve this problem. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=227.84s)]
*  We have a choice between peace and war. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=232.32s)]
*  And if we want peace, we can surrender to them right now. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=236.12s)]
*  And of course, stealing that quote from Reagan. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=238.88s)]
*  But that's not a good strategy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=241.07999999999998s)]
*  All right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=244.64s)]
*  And it's a fearful strategy. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=245.12s)]
*  It's certainly not a strategy for a country like the United States of America. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=246.4s)]
*  So the one thing we've got to worry about is the next step. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=250.56s)]
*  Not worry about, but be prepared for the next step. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=253.24s)]
*  If you were in command control now, knowing that we just took out the number two most important person in Iraq [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=255.84s)]
*  and certainly the best military mind in Iran, what would you be most focused on at this hour? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  Well, what we know the Iranians are very good at is surrogate warfare. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=269.36s)]
*  And this was what Soleimani did. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=272.48s)]
*  OK, he built surrogates throughout the region that could attack us on all fronts. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  And that's what we need to be prepared for. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=279.28s)]
*  We should be bolstering defenses on our bases in Iraq, in Bahrain and elsewhere. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=280.52s)]
*  And helping our allies in Israel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  That's what we should be doing in the short term. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=291.08s)]
*  All right, Dan, thank you for your service. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=293.47999999999996s)]
*  Good luck in Congress. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=295.11999999999995s)]
*  Thank you for everything. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=296.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. Thanks for weighing in on this. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VPGLpCpxOqw&t=296.96s)]
