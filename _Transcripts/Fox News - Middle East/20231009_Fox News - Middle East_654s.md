# New barrage of rockets hit Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E)
*  Alright, we begin with this. Fox News alert. Explosions and sirens heard in Jerusalem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=0.0s)]
*  Moments ago you just saw the videos. Long range missiles are fired towards the central [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=17.76s)]
*  part of the country. Arontre Yanks just posted a video of himself amidst the chaos. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=22.04s)]
*  This rocket barrage just targeted the city of Ashdod. We saw multiple impacts across [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=28.6s)]
*  this heavily populated area. We took cover next to a building, but you could see the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=34.96s)]
*  rockets coming off the Gaza Strip and slamming into buildings in this community. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=39.56s)]
*  More than 700 people in Israel have been murdered by Hamas terrorists since the war began, including [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=46.68000000000001s)]
*  at least four Americans. Israel now ordering a complete siege of Gaza, not letting food, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=54.08s)]
*  electricity or fuel in the territory. And that is where we stand on this Monday morning. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=60.76s)]
*  Benjamin Hall joins us right now from our European newsroom with the very latest. Benjamin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Lawrence Steve, Brian Ainsley, good morning. Yes, Trey still there right at the front, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=73.4s)]
*  seeing more of those rockets coming in from Gaza. What we're also hearing is that in the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=77.36s)]
*  last couple of hours, the IDF, that's the Israeli Defense Forces, have finally retaken [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=81.84s)]
*  all the towns along the Gaza border. That is about two days that some of these Hamas [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=86.76s)]
*  terrorists have managed to hold onto some of these towns. And we know that for a while [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=90.92s)]
*  they were controlling villages. They were going door to door. They were killing families. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=94.48s)]
*  And some of the images coming out of those villages have been simply horrific. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=98.2s)]
*  As we also heard, the Israelis have now completely blockaded Gaza. And the Israeli Defense Forces [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  come out with a statement saying that they have ordered a complete blockade of the Gaza [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=108.8s)]
*  Strip. They've even said that there will be no electricity, no food, no fuel. Everything [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=114.28s)]
*  is closed. We are fighting human animals and we will act accordingly. But the next step [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=119.74s)]
*  is going to be very, very difficult. And that's because of all the prisoners, the hostages [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=126.62s)]
*  that are being held right now by Hamas. There are at least 100 people, including women, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=131.12s)]
*  children, toddlers, elderly people, being held captive inside Gaza, inside the tunnels. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=137.24s)]
*  And you see some of the images of them. And you can imagine the atrocities that they are [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=142.24s)]
*  seeing right now. And what this does is it adds a very different complication to the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=146.44s)]
*  next step. We know that there are 100,000 Israeli forces getting together. They are [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=150.4s)]
*  planning on going into Gaza. But it is very complicated because of the prisoners that [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=155.12s)]
*  are being held right now. In the past, when Hamas took Israeli prisoners, they would often [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=159.56s)]
*  do a prisoner exchange. In 2007, they exchanged almost over a thousand Palestinian prisoners [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=164.6s)]
*  for one Israeli soldier. Well, Hamas now has around 100, maybe over 100, including some [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=170.4s)]
*  Americans. So it does look like a prisoner exchange for the moment is not going to happen. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=176.32s)]
*  Instead, Israel has said it is going to go in. It is going to annihilate Hamas as best [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=181.32s)]
*  as it can. But it's going to be difficult. For a while, the Israelis have stayed out [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=185.64000000000001s)]
*  of Gaza. Despite all the rocket attacks over the last few years, they knew how dangerous [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=190.0s)]
*  it is to go into Gaza. That's because they know it will be full of booby traps. It will [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=194.32s)]
*  be rigged. They will be facing an urban fight. And so now finally they've decided that they [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=198.32s)]
*  have to do it. One of the big issues, I think, on a bigger scale is perhaps whether or not [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=204.56s)]
*  Iran was involved. We know Iran supports Hamas. It gives them weapons. It trains them. It [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=209.36s)]
*  gives them money. But what we heard earlier today from the Wall Street Journal was that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=214.72s)]
*  they have evidence that Hamas and Hezbollah, they say their senior leaders did meet with [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=219.32s)]
*  Iranian security officials in Beirut on Monday and that they gave the green light for this [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=224.79999999999998s)]
*  attack to go ahead. The Wall Street Journal said this. They said officers of Iran's Islamic [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard Corps had worked with Hamas since August to devise the air, land [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  and sea incursions, the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=239.56s)]
*  War, those people said. So if that is confirmed, and yesterday Secretary Blinken said that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=245.44s)]
*  there was no intelligence that the U.S. had yet, although he did acknowledge that the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=249.68s)]
*  Iranians were supporting Hamas, well, that opens up a whole different scenario, a scenario [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=255.16s)]
*  where Israel may feel the need to retaliate against Iran for the death of 700, maybe more [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=259.0s)]
*  of its own citizens. And if that happens, we could see Hezbollah coming down from the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=264.64s)]
*  south. Hezbollah have stayed back for the moment. They have launched some rockets but [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=267.8s)]
*  they've entered some very unpopulated areas, so they haven't entered properly. But this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=271.12s)]
*  is on the border right now and there's every fear that this could escalate into a really [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  regional dramatic war. But for now, the focus really is on getting in, saving those hostages [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=280.16s)]
*  and annihilating Hamas as best they can, getting rid of all military placements they have. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=284.8s)]
*  This isn't going to be days, this isn't going to be weeks, this is going to be months ahead. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=289.12s)]
*  And it has changed Israeli policy towards them. In the last few years, there had been [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=292.08s)]
*  Gazans coming out of Gaza. There had been 20,000 a day. Things were considered to perhaps [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=297.48s)]
*  be getting better. That's been reversed. The policy moving forward is going to be a strict [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=303.16s)]
*  and a stern one. And so we wait to see exactly how that's going to play out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=307.64000000000004s)]
*  Benjamin, do you know, are there American hostages as well? I know there are four Americans [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=312.08000000000004s)]
*  that have been confirmed dead. What about hostages? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  Well just yesterday on Fox, the Israeli ambassador to the UN said that there were, he said that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=320.92s)]
*  there could be dozens of them being held inside Gaza. So we don't know the figures yet, to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=325.64s)]
*  be honest. But that did come from the Israelis. So they are saying there are some Americans [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=330.64s)]
*  being held, yes. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=334.44s)]
*  Well, Jonathan, you had the good news that the Israeli army has regained control of those [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=335.44s)]
*  communities along the Gaza area that has been controlled by Hamas. That's really good news. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=339.52s)]
*  But now today, what's happened in the last hour or so is you've got Hamas firing these [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=346.6s)]
*  rockets deep inside of Israel. They're not content just to be along the border. Now they're [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  aiming at the capital. They're aiming at Jerusalem and Tel Aviv as retaliation for the strikes [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  on the people's houses in the Hamas areas. That just changes everything. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=363.32000000000005s)]
*  Yes. Hamas are completely committed now to a full-out war. They said so about 50 days [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=370.32000000000005s)]
*  ago. They said they were preparing for a full-out war. The Israelis had maybe not enough attention [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=375.92s)]
*  because they were paid to that. But they are going to launch everything they've got. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=380.36s)]
*  They are ready for urban warfare street to street. And yes, those rockets, they keep [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=382.8s)]
*  firing. We've seen some of the longer-range rockets as well, which until a few years ago [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=386.68s)]
*  they didn't have. It's thought that Iran helped provide and build those rockets. And so those [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=390.32s)]
*  rockets are the ones that can reach Jerusalem. They can reach Tel Aviv. And that's why this [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=394.44s)]
*  is so frightening at the moment. The Iron Dome system is very effective. It blocks out [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=399.0s)]
*  many of these rockets. But it only blocks out about 80 percent of them. And Trey, just [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=403.28000000000003s)]
*  in the last 10 minutes, posted a video showing the rockets still landing in Ashkelon where [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=407.36s)]
*  he is. So that's one of the reasons that the Israelis are going in. They know there are [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=411.0s)]
*  factories, military factories. They continue to build rockets. And of course they continue [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  to build rockets. But they build them in schools. They build them in hospitals. And that's why [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=419.18s)]
*  it's going to be so difficult for the Israelis to move in and to try and annihilate the terrorists [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=423.8s)]
*  while trying to protect the civilians in there. So you know, it's so interesting, Benjamin, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=428.64s)]
*  by the way, Trey's going to join us. He just needed a little bit of rest. He'll join us [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=432.16s)]
*  later in the show. Benjamin, what's so interesting is they had these meetings reportedly, according [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=434.84s)]
*  to the Wall Street Journal in Beirut, where Hezbollah is located. And everyone's wondering, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=439.32s)]
*  will this be a two-front war? What will it take for Hezbollah to get involved? They've [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=443.44s)]
*  had some skirmishes in some disputed areas. But you have to think, if they were able to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=446.76s)]
*  plan in detail the initial attack, did they anticipate the reaction? And is Hezbollah [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=451.47999999999996s)]
*  plotting and planning one to come in? Well, it's interesting because, yes, we've seen [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=457.88s)]
*  some rockets come from southern Lebanon, but they haven't targeted any of the populated [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=462.86s)]
*  areas yet. And so the message from Hezbollah seems to be that they are on the side of the [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  Palestinians, but they're not getting fully involved at this point. And you wonder whether [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=471.82s)]
*  that is Iran holding them back and Iran waiting to see whether Israel will reach out at Iran. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=474.78000000000003s)]
*  If that happens, then, yes, you can expect Hezbollah to come in in a big way. And they [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=479.36s)]
*  have far more rockets than the Hamas does. That really escalates things. But right now, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=483.24s)]
*  they're staying quiet for the moment. But that's another threat that Iran has, that [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=490.06s)]
*  Hamas has, that Hezbollah has, that they will come. They will escalate this if the Israelis [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=494.7s)]
*  start to attack ever more. So, Benjamin, I had the opportunity to talk to one of my friends [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=499.14s)]
*  in the IDF, and he told me the targets that they're striking right now were already on [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=504.1s)]
*  Israel's radar. So when are they going to start attacking other targets? And why didn't [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=509.1s)]
*  they not attack these targets before? You know, there's been a real balance recently. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=515.26s)]
*  The Israelis have been trying to hold back. And they usually respond when Hamas launches [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=522.06s)]
*  rockets. That's when they respond. They generally don't bomb if there hasn't been any altercation. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=529.46s)]
*  I think now they are realizing perhaps they held back. Perhaps they should have been more [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=534.98s)]
*  involved in the past. And yes, big questions about how they didn't see this attack coming. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=538.98s)]
*  Up to a thousand of these Hamas terrorists came across. That is not a small operation [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=543.98s)]
*  by land, by sea, by air. Meetings that we're hearing from the Wall Street Journal in Beirut. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=548.1800000000001s)]
*  And yet the Israelis have said they had great signal intelligence, great human intelligence, [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=552.98s)]
*  and yet no warning at all about this. And so, yes, the question will be asked in a while. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=557.22s)]
*  Could more have been done? But right now the Israeli focus is getting in, getting rid of [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=562.7s)]
*  the threat that is posed to them and straight away. And obviously the questions will keep [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=566.2600000000001s)]
*  coming after that. But one thing is certain. That is Israel is totally unified. Israel [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=570.1s)]
*  is unified right now. And in the past there were concerns. Should Israel go in on the [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=573.82s)]
*  ground when rockets came over? Should they escalate this? That is not being doubted right [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=576.9000000000001s)]
*  now. Everyone I've spoken to in Israel across the spectrum, the political spectrum from [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=581.38s)]
*  the left to the right, are unified. This is a terror threat and it has to change. They [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=584.94s)]
*  see this as their 9-11 and they will not let it happen again is how they see it. So we [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=588.82s)]
*  expect them to go in and we expect them to take out everything they can that has to do [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=593.46s)]
*  with Hamas and their military capabilities. Is it true that there was this perception, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=597.7s)]
*  that it seemed like there was this perception that Israel was the bully here. And so they [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=601.98s)]
*  held back some restraints. There was some sort of intelligence that they saw them training [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=608.98s)]
*  and all that. They didn't know the exact day they were going to attack or anything like [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=613.22s)]
*  that. But Israel held some restraint because in the world's eye there was this perception [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=616.14s)]
*  that they were the aggressors. Yes, I mean look, you look around the world, you look [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=621.22s)]
*  at how the UN responds forever. For many years Israel have been the bullies here. They [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=626.74s)]
*  are the ones who have held Gazans inside and surrounded by walls. But the Israelis have [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=631.66s)]
*  watched Hamas train and mobilize constantly. They have constantly been aware of it. And [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=639.0600000000001s)]
*  now they won't be held back by what they would say the UN and many of these other groups [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=645.5s)]
*  say against them. This is their time to wipe out the evil. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=649.26s)]
*  Alright Benjamin, thanks so much. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofJrTH3h48E&t=652.66s)]
