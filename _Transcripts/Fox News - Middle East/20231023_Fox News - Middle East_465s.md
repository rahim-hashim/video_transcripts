# Drones attack base housing US troops in Syria
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0)
*  We are keeping a close eye on the action unfolding in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. defense officials confirmed to Fox News that a base housing U.S. troops in Syria was [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  attacked by drones this morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  No injuries have been reported. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=13.46s)]
*  It comes as the U.S. bolsters its presence in the region. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  Two aircraft carrier groups have been deployed, joining fighter jets that have just arrived. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=19.72s)]
*  The Pentagon is also sending more missile defense systems. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=25.12s)]
*  And Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has about 100 more troops on ready-to-deploy orders, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=28.68s)]
*  adding to the 2,000 troops already on 24-hours notice to deploy to the Middle East. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=34.84s)]
*  It's all in the hopes of deterring Iran and other bad actors from interfering in Israel's [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=40.96s)]
*  war with Hamas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=46.52s)]
*  Meanwhile, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is connecting the dots, warning of the larger [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=48.08s)]
*  looming threat to the United States and deeming Iran, China, and Russia a new axis of evil. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=53.74s)]
*  The world is more endangered today than it has been in my lifetime. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=62.06s)]
*  You have to respond to conditions that actually exist that are a threat to the United States. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  The Iranians are a threat to us as well. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  And so this is an emergency. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=82.4s)]
*  It's an emergency that we step up and deal with this axis of evil, China, Russia, Iran, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=84.98s)]
*  because it's an immediate threat to the United States. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=97.46000000000001s)]
*  Pete, the argument is that he is voicing what the defense and intelligence communities have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=101.74000000000001s)]
*  been stating for a long time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=108.2s)]
*  The question is, will our administration respond accordingly? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=109.64s)]
*  The problem is I don't even want to say little. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=114.74s)]
*  No faith in this administration to execute. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=117.18s)]
*  No faith in Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon to put together a coherent military strategy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=119.38s)]
*  And then you just have targets in the region who are not deterring anything. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=124.64s)]
*  This is the administration that was going to deter the Ukraine invasion, that was going [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=128.32s)]
*  to deter the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=131.88s)]
*  They're obsessed with climatizing and climate change in the military. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=134.98s)]
*  And then real threats pop up. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=138.78s)]
*  And all they've done instead is drive Russia into the hands of China, empowered Iran with [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=140.44s)]
*  money and the capability to reach a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=145.12s)]
*  Imagine if they had a bomb and what the situation would look like in that scenario. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=147.4s)]
*  So it's good to have troops there if you're really going to deter. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=151.4s)]
*  But if you're led by fools, which we are right now, and Mitch McConnell could say that he's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=155.38s)]
*  part of the same foreign policy consensus that brought us to this point, then it doesn't [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=160.32s)]
*  make you feel good about the situation we're in, even with all that combat power. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=165.4s)]
*  And Tammy, that's exactly the point that apparently deterrence hasn't worked at all given that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  just this morning our troops yet again were fired on. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=173.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, look, and then you've got, whether it's McConnell, people who've been in Washington [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=176.82s)]
*  for decades. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=180.94s)]
*  And the answer has always been for decades, just stop Israel. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=182.24s)]
*  Go in and stop and withdraw, have ceasefire, send in the aid. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=185.66s)]
*  And it's over and over and over and over again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=189.86s)]
*  And this is what you end up getting. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  You get an entity that believes the same damn thing's going to happen and it encourages [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=193.98s)]
*  them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=198.32s)]
*  They push it further and further and further. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=199.32s)]
*  And that's what we saw. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=201.0s)]
*  I don't know, maybe Joe Biden would call what happened on the 7th a limited incursion. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=202.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  But that is the problem. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=207.23999999999998s)]
*  It's not just your opinion. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=208.42s)]
*  What you stated is the world's opinion. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=209.94s)]
*  And we saw that after Afghanistan was the panic in Taiwan and other places about people [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=212.79999999999998s)]
*  feeling like they're on their own. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=218.14s)]
*  And oh, the joy of that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=219.92s)]
*  So is this a war with Hamas? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=221.23999999999998s)]
*  Yes, but it's a proxy for Iran. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=223.1s)]
*  We can't ignore that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=225.5s)]
*  And I think that this is what when we will admit more Americans die in all likelihood, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=227.4s)]
*  just like they did in Afghanistan. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=232.22s)]
*  This is on the hands of Biden and everyone in the establishment who's let this grow into [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=233.98s)]
*  the cancer that it is. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=238.73999999999998s)]
*  Kayleigh, Tammy brings up President Biden. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=240.1s)]
*  Three quarters of American believe in funding to secure the southern border and the same [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=242.78s)]
*  amount approximately to fund this war to support Israel. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=247.98s)]
*  Just over half support funding for Ukraine and a far distant below is humanitarian aid. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=252.0s)]
*  And yet in this massive spending package that he announced during his lackluster speech [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=256.52s)]
*  on Thursday, all of those numbers were reversed. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  The massive amount of money going toward Ukraine and humanitarian aid and just a little bit, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  15 percent to, for example, the southern border. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=268.48s)]
*  So there seems to be a disconnect massively between what this president chooses to do [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=270.84s)]
*  and how Americans deem it is in our best security interests, which, as he said, was the point [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=275.24s)]
*  of that funding. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=280.88s)]
*  A total disconnect. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=281.9s)]
*  So when you look at this behemoth of an aid package, 14.3 billion to Israel directly earmarked [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=283.54s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=289.98s)]
*  Great. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=290.98s)]
*  It should be. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=291.98s)]
*  But when you read down 10 billion, roughly 10 billion for humanitarian needs across Israel, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=292.98s)]
*  Ukraine, Gaza and other global needs. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=297.98s)]
*  So just four billion shy of what you're giving to Israel is a bucket of money that you could [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=301.5s)]
*  theoretically just shove all into the Gaza Strip, which we know goes to Hamas, doesn't [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=306.58s)]
*  go to the civilians in need there. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=310.91999999999996s)]
*  This is a naive administration. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=312.76s)]
*  If you watched his speech, didn't give you much hope. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=314.47999999999996s)]
*  It was a speech for a domestic political audience, checking the right boxes, saying the right [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=317.32s)]
*  things, being sufficiently supportive of Israel in word, perhaps not in action. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=322.12s)]
*  One mention of Iran, very tepid. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=327.23999999999995s)]
*  And where was the message to those holding hostages? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=329.44s)]
*  Do not harm a hostage. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=331.56s)]
*  If you do, you will meet the fate of Soleimani. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=333.06s)]
*  That didn't exist. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=335.29999999999995s)]
*  It was for a domestic political audience solely. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  And Harris, this is a commander in chief who said that our greatest threat is climate [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=338.7s)]
*  change and focuses on sort of that woke advertising, for example, the Navy with people skipping [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=342.58s)]
*  around and parading. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=348.3s)]
*  So I worry that our troops are in greater harm's way because this administration failed [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=349.46s)]
*  to ready them for this action now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=354.06s)]
*  We all are. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=356.3s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=357.3s)]
*  They want to hit us here too. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=358.3s)]
*  You don't think there's some people who may have come across the border before we started [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=359.62s)]
*  counting heads from that region just about a week ago? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=362.42s)]
*  I mean, we weren't trying hard enough to figure out who the gotaways were in between the checkpoints. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=365.64000000000004s)]
*  This was somewhat coordinated. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=370.68s)]
*  It had to have been. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=372.32s)]
*  And I say somewhat because they always hate us and they're always trying to come up with [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=373.32s)]
*  something from somewhere. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=376.96000000000004s)]
*  But you cannot miss the signs here. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=379.12s)]
*  Just days after that sweetheart deal that released $6 billion in sanctions, whether [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=383.36s)]
*  they were going to have spent it on terror or whatever, what it allowed them to do was [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=389.32s)]
*  to tuck that away and to spend other money on other things and then have that be their [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=392.12s)]
*  backup. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=396.74s)]
*  That's parked in Qatar. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=397.74s)]
*  You want to know the connection? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=398.74s)]
*  That's a connection. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=400.18s)]
*  And who's also right next to that money in Qatar? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=401.38s)]
*  The diaspora office's leader, the former leader of Hamas. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=405.22s)]
*  That's where his new job is. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=411.46s)]
*  But I do want to bring this up. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=413.62s)]
*  So we've just found out from the Pentagon that a base housing U.S. troops in Syria has [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=415.58s)]
*  been attacked by drones today. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-TazEiDsE0&t=419.82s)]
