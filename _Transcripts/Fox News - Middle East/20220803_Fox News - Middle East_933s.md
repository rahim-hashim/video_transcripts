# Larry Kudlow: 'Tip of the hat' to Biden for pulling off killing of al-Qaeda leader
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 03, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E)
*  Happy Tuesday, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=0.0s)]
*  First, we have to acknowledge the great news. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=2.5s)]
*  It's great news for you and me and all of America, frankly. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=5.7s)]
*  Yes, Larry Kudlow's back. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=9.88s)]
*  You didn't think we could do it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=11.74s)]
*  But there you are. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=17.68s)]
*  It took months of hard work, lots of hot tubbing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=18.48s)]
*  But he's here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=21.28s)]
*  I'm not proud of some of the things I had to do [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=22.16s)]
*  in that tub, Larry. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=23.96s)]
*  But I'll do whatever it takes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=25.96s)]
*  Also, side note, al-Qaeda leader Al Zawahiri was killed. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=27.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=31.52s)]
*  You're sick. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  He was just 71 years young. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=39.7s)]
*  His remains will be cremated and spread over his already [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=42.58s)]
*  cremated remains. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=45.84s)]
*  And to think he just finished paying off his women's studies [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=50.82s)]
*  degree. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=53.38s)]
*  We went to his family for comment. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=55.6s)]
*  That's terrible. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=64.48s)]
*  Show the guy some respect. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=65.42s)]
*  Let's go to his real family. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=66.96s)]
*  You know, that's even worse. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=78.4s)]
*  You know how those guys hate pork? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=79.56s)]
*  It's the other white meat they despise. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=83.7s)]
*  No wonder he became a terrorist. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=87.96000000000001s)]
*  At least he didn't get into stripping. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=89.26s)]
*  Because once the robe comes off, it's just ankle socks. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=91.16s)]
*  Don't ask me how I know. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=95.26s)]
*  So when I first heard the news, I [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=97.0s)]
*  have to say I was a little confused. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=98.4s)]
*  And no, that's not a quote from the president. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=100.28s)]
*  First, I had not heard that name in a while, like Chris Wallace. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=102.58s)]
*  But it was a name I literally heard or wrote about every day [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=109.08s)]
*  for a period of years after 9-11. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=113.66s)]
*  But for some reason, we stopped hearing about him. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=115.82s)]
*  And also stopped talking much about Islamic terror, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=118.11999999999999s)]
*  especially after Trump got in. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=120.52s)]
*  Remember ISIS and those videos? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=122.66s)]
*  We should. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=125.06s)]
*  That was bad. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=125.89999999999999s)]
*  So when the news broke yesterday during the five, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=127.36s)]
*  it was if my terror muscles were flabby. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  I hadn't used them in so long, unlike my actual quads [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=132.26s)]
*  that won a blue ribbon at that wine festival. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=136.04s)]
*  Thanks, Larry, for taking me. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=139.6s)]
*  But the terror muscles, they were rusty. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=141.5s)]
*  I imagine it's how the view panelists [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=144.16s)]
*  feel about their brains. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=146.06s)]
*  But I realized I needed to get back in shape quick. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=148.4s)]
*  The killing is a helpful reminder [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=150.9s)]
*  that terror, like smallpox and Chris Cuomo, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=152.46s)]
*  never really goes away, especially when 9-11 plodders [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=155.48s)]
*  have assistants like the Taliban. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=160.94s)]
*  I had no idea he was in Afghanistan [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=163.38s)]
*  hanging with the Taliban, and not in a good way [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=165.68s)]
*  at the end of a rope. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=168.12s)]
*  But turns out he was staying at a house [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=169.62s)]
*  apparently belonging to Afghan Deputy Interior Minister [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=171.28s)]
*  and New York Times contributor Sir Judine Haqqani. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=174.2s)]
*  And it's not a bad place to die. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=177.58s)]
*  It's amazing what you can get from Airbnb. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=180.6s)]
*  Although I don't think the owner will be too happy [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=184.14s)]
*  about the condition the guests left the place in, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=186.02s)]
*  that cleaning bill is going to suck. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=189.12s)]
*  How do you get bone matter out of the Formica? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  I know, too soon, right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=197.32s)]
*  But take a look, the place had a balcony, it had great views. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=199.82s)]
*  And now, thanks to a Hellfire missile, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=203.18s)]
*  it's got an open-air kitchen. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=204.98s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=206.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=207.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=207.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=208.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=208.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=209.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=209.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=210.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=210.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=211.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=211.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=212.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=212.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=213.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=213.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=214.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=214.66s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=215.16s)]
*  With 72 virgins cooking in it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=215.66s)]
*  Yeah, huh? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=219.9s)]
*  You'll wish you died and gone to heaven. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=220.9s)]
*  But let's show a picture of the dead guy. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=224.06s)]
*  Yep, that's definitely Alza Hwari, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=226.01999999999998s)]
*  or as Merrick Garland calls him, a white supremacist. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  If you'll notice, his red hat is under the turban. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Of course, this raises some questions. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  Is Afghanistan going back to being a base of operations [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=239.7s)]
*  of terrorists? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=242.54s)]
*  Seems so, which means like J. Lo and Ben Affleck, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=243.34s)]
*  Al Qaeda and the Taliban are reunited. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=246.73999999999998s)]
*  It feels so bad. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=250.26s)]
*  I'm just a little nervous we whacked this guy. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=252.01999999999998s)]
*  And meanwhile, thanks to Joe's open borders policy, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=254.06s)]
*  there have been confirmed reports of anywhere [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=256.84s)]
*  from 50 to 100 people on the terror watch list [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=258.64s)]
*  unaccounted for in our country right now. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=260.79999999999995s)]
*  But still, this is good news that we killed him, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=263.52s)]
*  because it means we can pick off the people we need to pick off [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=265.88s)]
*  without waging full blown wars. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=268.5s)]
*  And any day when a terrorist dies is a good day in my book. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=270.56s)]
*  Of course, when you kill a terrorist, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=273.88s)]
*  another one takes its place. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=275.34s)]
*  You know, in a way, it's just like canceled late night talk [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=277.03999999999996s)]
*  shows. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=279.64s)]
*  Terrible. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=280.14s)]
*  One flops, and there are three worse ones waiting in the wings. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=284.14s)]
*  You didn't think I could make that analogy, did you? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=288.14s)]
*  But I did, and that's why I get paid the big bucks. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=290.14s)]
*  Those are some big bucks. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=299.14s)]
*  Don't be so sad. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=302.14s)]
*  I'll be home soon, fellas. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=303.14s)]
*  Just save some acorns and apples for the next time. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=305.14s)]
*  Just save some acorns and apples for me. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=308.14s)]
*  Now, some people don't want to credit Biden, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=311.14s)]
*  since after all, he said al-Qaeda was no threat in Afghanistan. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=313.14s)]
*  What interest do we have in Afghanistan at this point [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=317.14s)]
*  with al-Qaeda gone? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=322.14s)]
*  We went to Afghanistan for the express purpose [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=324.14s)]
*  of getting rid of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=327.14s)]
*  as well as getting Osama bin Laden. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=331.14s)]
*  And we did. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=335.14s)]
*  So like my aunt, who eats plastic army men, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=337.14s)]
*  Biden's claims have not aged well. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=341.14s)]
*  It appears al-Qaeda was there and were active [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=345.14s)]
*  and out in the open like a cold sore on a springbreaker's lip. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=348.14s)]
*  I hope it was a cold sore, not monkeypox. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=353.14s)]
*  By the way, what was I doing with her? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=357.14s)]
*  And I think we can be skeptical about how much Biden really knew [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=359.14s)]
*  about any of this, since like a rare mushroom, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=362.14s)]
*  he's kept in the dark on everything. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=365.14s)]
*  He's basically living in a nonstop blackout, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=367.14s)]
*  like son, like father. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=370.14s)]
*  For him, every day... [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=372.14s)]
*  How would that get applause? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=374.14s)]
*  For him, every day starts out as a blank slate [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=381.14s)]
*  and someone comes in and adds the daily specials. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=383.14s)]
*  I guess what I'm trying to say is his brains are cream spinach [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=386.14s)]
*  and corn chowder. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=388.14s)]
*  And remember, this guy did take a victory lap [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=390.14s)]
*  after we got bin Laden after saying he was against taking him out. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=392.14s)]
*  That's like me taking credit for Taylor Swift's success [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=395.14s)]
*  when I had nothing to do with it. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=398.14s)]
*  I mean, true, we dated and everything. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=400.14s)]
*  And her biggest hit, Shake It Off, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=404.14s)]
*  was about me stubbing my toe on her bedpost. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=406.14s)]
*  But unlike her, I'll leave the dirty laundry to Kat's office. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=411.14s)]
*  But still, when bad things happen under a president, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=415.14s)]
*  they get the blame, and when good things happen [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=418.14s)]
*  under a president, they get the credit. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=420.14s)]
*  The problem with Joe, however, is he won't take the responsibility [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=422.14s)]
*  for the disasters, so it's hard for me to give him a slap [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=425.14s)]
*  on the back over this. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=428.14s)]
*  But what the hell? I will anyone, anyway. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=430.14s)]
*  Nice one, Joe. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=433.14s)]
*  But really, it's our American forces who get the accolades. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=435.14s)]
*  It's the players who win the World Series, not the manager, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=438.14s)]
*  especially one who can't find his way out of the locker room. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=441.14s)]
*  So job well done, guys and gals. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=444.14s)]
*  You sent a hellish monster straight to hell [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=446.14s)]
*  in tiny little packages. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=448.14s)]
*  I wish it could have been sooner, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=450.14s)]
*  but I say that about everything, including 2024. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=452.14s)]
*  Let's welcome tonight's guest. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=455.14s)]
*  He puts the fine in finance. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=460.14s)]
*  Host of Kudlow on Fox Business, Sexy Larry Kudlow. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=464.14s)]
*  She's one bad-ass broadcaster. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=468.14s)]
*  Host of Sunny's Corner on Sirius XM, Patriot, Sonny Johnson. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=471.14s)]
*  She found her cat in a dumpster, or vice versa. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=479.14s)]
*  Fox News contributor, Kat Tiv. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=482.14s)]
*  And his jumping jacks require special clearance from the FAA. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=485.14s)]
*  My massive side here at the FAA is the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=488.14s)]
*  World Television Champion, Tyrus. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=496.3s)]
*  Larry, this is good news, but do you care to expand on your own [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=498.3s)]
*  perspective on this? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=501.3s)]
*  I thought you did a very good job. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=503.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=505.3s)]
*  Really, I thought you did a very good job. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=506.3s)]
*  And we should never forget 9-11 and how bad that was. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=508.3s)]
*  And Zahir was a key planner. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=511.3s)]
*  So you're dead right on all counts. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=513.3s)]
*  And I'm glad they got him. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=515.3s)]
*  No hell is good enough for that son of a bitch. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=517.3s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=519.3s)]
*  And I'm glad you got him. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=520.3s)]
*  Tip of the hat to Joe Biden, especially tip of the hat to the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=522.3s)]
*  intelligence services who really engineered this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=525.3s)]
*  And I'll just, having said that, I'll issue a warning because you [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=528.3s)]
*  mentioned it. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=531.3s)]
*  The fact is Taliban is harboring al-Qaeda's or Haqqani's, okay? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=532.3s)]
*  The second fact is we still have not made good progress on the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=537.3s)]
*  Taliban. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=541.3s)]
*  We have not made good progress on the Taliban. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=542.3s)]
*  We have not made good progress on the Taliban. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=545.3s)]
*  The second fact is we still have not made good on our Afghanistan [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=548.3s)]
*  promises to help all those American friends and allies who are [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=553.3s)]
*  still there stuck in that despotic country. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=557.3s)]
*  And actually something Mike Pompeo said to me on our show today, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=561.3s)]
*  American taxpayers should not give one nickel to this Taliban regime. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=565.3s)]
*  They are terrorists. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=569.3s)]
*  They hate America. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=570.3s)]
*  They hate freedom. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=571.3s)]
*  They hate all our values. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=572.3s)]
*  So good. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=573.3s)]
*  So as I hear he's gone, but we've got to keep our guard up all the [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=574.3s)]
*  time because they're coming after us. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=579.3s)]
*  You know, that leads me to probably an obvious follow-up question. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=581.3s)]
*  How did Mike Pompeo lose all that weight? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=586.3s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=588.3s)]
*  I hate to be a spokesperson, but I think he ate less. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=593.3s)]
*  I hear that works. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=598.3s)]
*  I hear that works. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=601.3s)]
*  It was not good. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=602.3s)]
*  I just came up with that. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=603.3s)]
*  I thought that was excellent. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=604.3s)]
*  Was that very cool? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=605.3s)]
*  You're doing good, kid. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=606.3s)]
*  I was completely unprepared. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=607.3s)]
*  It wasn't in the notes. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=609.3s)]
*  Sunny, always great to see you. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=611.3s)]
*  What's your take on all of this? [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=616.3s)]
*  I feel bad laughing at so many of your jokes in the beginning. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=618.3s)]
*  But I guess appropriate for Greg. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=622.3s)]
*  I'm going to put that out there. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=626.3s)]
*  One of the things that I think is most dangerous about Zahra Hiridhine is if [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=628.3s)]
*  you listen to what everyone says, they say the main thing about him was he [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=633.3s)]
*  didn't have the cult of personality that Ben Lotton had. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=637.3s)]
*  So that's what scares me more than anything, that the next one that comes [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=640.3s)]
*  after him is going to not only have the murderous ideology, but is also going [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=645.3s)]
*  to have the personality to push it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=650.3s)]
*  And I think that might be a reason why we haven't heard so much about it. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=652.3s)]
*  In the last couple of years, but if they get the right face and the right voice [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=656.3s)]
*  out there to be in leadership of what they're doing, then I think we're really [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=661.3s)]
*  going to hear a lot more coming out of Afghanistan. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=665.3s)]
*  But if you think about it in terms of our politicians here pushed us into [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=669.3s)]
*  globalism, thinking this was going to be the answer to what ails us here in [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=674.3s)]
*  America, and part of that was the war on terror. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=679.3s)]
*  And now what we're seeing is the East isn't participating in our globalism. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=683.3s)]
*  Africa isn't participating in our globalism. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=688.3s)]
*  South America isn't participating in our globalism, so it's not globalism. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=691.3s)]
*  It's just Westernism. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=695.3s)]
*  And shout out to Hoteb Jesus for saying that on my show. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=697.3s)]
*  But that's where we are now, is that we are coming to a realization that as a [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=700.3s)]
*  nation, we have been pushed into this idea of globalization, and it's like [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=705.3s)]
*  we're the only kid at the birthday party. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=710.3s)]
*  Like nobody else is showing up. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=712.3s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=714.3s)]
*  And it's going to be very sad when we go to open the presence and we realize [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=715.3s)]
*  exactly what's there in terms of lost treasure, in terms of lost lives, in terms [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=720.3s)]
*  of lost stature across the world. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=726.3s)]
*  Yeah, that's where we are. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=728.3s)]
*  And they want to call us isolationists for pointing that out. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=730.3s)]
*  No, y'all did a very good job of isolating us on your own. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=732.3s)]
*  We had nothing to do with that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=736.3s)]
*  That's a brilliant point, especially the point about the absence of Al Jahawe being [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=737.3s)]
*  due to his personality. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=742.3s)]
*  Kat, you're an expert at getting bombed. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=744.3s)]
*  Apparently you'll never get tired of this. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=746.3s)]
*  I know, I know. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=752.3s)]
*  Oh, it gets worse as the show goes on, Kat. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=754.3s)]
*  I just want to warn you, a little trigger warning there. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=756.3s)]
*  As a libertarian, are you okay with this? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=758.3s)]
*  Oh, no, I am certainly not. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=760.3s)]
*  The terrorists should live. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=763.3s)]
*  What kind of question is that? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=765.3s)]
*  Okay, yeah, I'm going to blow your mind here. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=767.3s)]
*  I think the terrorists bad. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=769.3s)]
*  9-11 was also bad. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=771.3s)]
*  Good job. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=773.3s)]
*  Yeah, you tell me you did 9-11, I'm going to say no, sir, that was not good. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=775.3s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=777.3s)]
*  Good job. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=779.3s)]
*  How many do you expect me to do some kind of nuanced take on this? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=781.3s)]
*  I was just thinking if you had some kind of complexity having to do with missing people [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=783.3s)]
*  I don't know what you libertarians think. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=789.3s)]
*  Well, we're not pro-terrorists. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=791.3s)]
*  Right, that's good. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=793.3s)]
*  All right, well, you learned something new about me today. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=795.3s)]
*  Tyrus, all right, wrap it up for us with your thoughtful... [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=797.3s)]
*  You know what, I'm going to be the bad guy here. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=801.3s)]
*  I guess I'll be the cat in this situation. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=803.3s)]
*  I'm concerned about the point of this, but I'm going to be the bad guy. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=805.3s)]
*  I'm going to be the bad guy. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=807.3s)]
*  I'm going to be the bad guy. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=809.3s)]
*  I'm going to be the bad guy. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=811.3s)]
*  I'm going to be the bad guy. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=813.3s)]
*  I'm going to be the bad guy. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=815.3s)]
*  I'm concerned about the point of this. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=817.3s)]
*  You spit in the face of all the allies we had in Afghanistan. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=819.3s)]
*  You left them hanging. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=823.3s)]
*  You empowered the bad guys. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=825.3s)]
*  China's punking us. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=827.3s)]
*  Russia's punking us. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=829.3s)]
*  And you go and kill the quiet guy that everyone forgot about who was powerless. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=831.3s)]
*  So now you just inspired everyone who needed an excuse for martyrdom. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=835.3s)]
*  That's the problem with this administration. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=841.3s)]
*  We can't even... [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=843.3s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi has to fly to Taiwan. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=845.3s)]
*  I'm going. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=847.3s)]
*  And our administration is like, I probably wouldn't go. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=849.3s)]
*  I don't know. China's bigger than us. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=851.3s)]
*  That's our administration. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=853.3s)]
*  Our previous administration, [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=855.3s)]
*  if someone would have made a threat like that to Pelosi, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=857.3s)]
*  they'd have been like, for every plane I see, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=859.3s)]
*  there'll be 500 of ours and a bomb. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=861.3s)]
*  It would have been a threat. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=863.3s)]
*  No one would talk to the United States that way. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=865.3s)]
*  Afghanistan wouldn't think about the things that we've done. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=867.3s)]
*  But we continue to make these horrible mistakes, these gaffes. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=869.3s)]
*  So you pissed it down your leg in Afghanistan, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=871.3s)]
*  and now you went and you gave them a martyr. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=875.3s)]
*  So I'm not as thrilled about it. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=877.3s)]
*  I'm glad he's dead, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=879.3s)]
*  but I just think the timing was pathetic [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=881.3s)]
*  and it's not going to take our minds off inflation, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=883.3s)]
*  horrible what you're doing to our education, with our police. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=885.3s)]
*  Nothing of that's going to work. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=887.3s)]
*  No smokescreen is going to work. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=889.3s)]
*  So you killed a guy who was ineffective at the top. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=891.3s)]
*  So you've inspired a bunch of new guys, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=893.3s)]
*  and we have an open border. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=895.3s)]
*  Well played. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=897.3s)]
*  Like, statistically speaking, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=899.3s)]
*  a lot of the times when you take someone out, [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=905.3s)]
*  the lower level people who replace them [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=907.3s)]
*  are even more ruthless. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=909.3s)]
*  But the timing. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=911.3s)]
*  We haven't closed one deal yet. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=913.3s)]
*  To Sunny's point, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=915.3s)]
*  if they get a charismatic leader again, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=917.3s)]
*  then all bets are off. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=919.3s)]
*  And if you're not going to get it, [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=929.3s)]
*  then you're going to get it. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=931.3s)]
*  If you're going to get it, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=933.3s)]
*  then you're going to get it. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=935.3s)]
*  If you're going to get it, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=937.3s)]
*  then you're going to get it. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=939.3s)]
*  If you're going to get it, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=941.3s)]
*  then you're going to get it. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=943.3s)]
*  If you're going to get it, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YCEZ6pkY0E&t=945.3s)]
