# 'DANGEROUS RHETORIC': GOP rep calls to ban Rashida Tlaib from intel briefings
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc)
*  Democracy is messy sometimes, but it is our system. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=0.0s)]
*  This conference that you see, this House Republican majority is united. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=6.5s)]
*  I'm honored to have the support of my colleagues and what they understand about this is this [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=10.92s)]
*  is servant leadership. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  We're going to serve the people of this country. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=17.2s)]
*  Today the House is scheduled to vote yet again for House Speaker. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=19.96s)]
*  After Republicans nominated Louisiana Congressman Mike Johnson late last night, so will the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=23.44s)]
*  fourth time be the charm? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=28.0s)]
*  That's a great question, Todd. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=29.36s)]
*  Texas Congressman Ronnie Jackson will cast his vote today at noon and he joins us now, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=30.36s)]
*  Congressman. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=35.04s)]
*  So over the course of a day, Republicans selected Tom Emmer, then he drops out, now Mike Johnson. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=36.04s)]
*  But he is 89 votes short on that secret ballot. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=41.36s)]
*  So does he have your vote and what's his path forward? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=45.24s)]
*  Yeah, he absolutely has my vote. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=47.84s)]
*  And we did a roll call vote last night before we left where everybody stood up and said [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  who they're going to vote for. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=53.92s)]
*  And everybody was in full support of Mike Johnson. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=55.32s)]
*  He's going to be a fantastic speaker. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=59.34s)]
*  We have to make it official today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=61.02s)]
*  So we'll go to the floor of the House today around noon and we'll vote for him. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=62.02s)]
*  You know, I've been saying for a long time, you know, I regret that we've been at this [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=65.26s)]
*  for three weeks, but you know, the hope was that we would be able to make lemonade out [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=68.7s)]
*  of lemons. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=72.9s)]
*  And I think we just did that. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=73.9s)]
*  Mike Johnson is going to be an absolutely fantastic speaker. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=74.9s)]
*  And I'm super excited that he's going to represent our conference. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=78.38s)]
*  I hope you're right because I'm sick and tired of the Bachelor reality show playing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=83.4s)]
*  out every day on C-SPAN. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=87.06s)]
*  Me too. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=88.06s)]
*  Let's get to the business of the war in Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=89.54s)]
*  The IDF now directly linking Iran to the attacks on our troops in the Middle East, also to [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=92.10000000000001s)]
*  the Hamas attacks on Israel, of course. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=96.7s)]
*  Tony Blinken says our country, the United States of America, will respond swiftly and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=99.54s)]
*  decisively. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  But, Congressman, have you seen anything so far from this administration that reeks of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=105.82000000000001s)]
*  swiftness or decisiveness? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=111.18s)]
*  I've seen nothing from this administration. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=113.64s)]
*  I've seen nothing but they're pandering to Iran. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=115.22s)]
*  These are Iranian proxies that are attacking our U.S. troops in Iran and Syria. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=117.48s)]
*  And we have to send a message to them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  We have to do something to these, not only to these Iranian proxies, but to Iran. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=123.04s)]
*  But the Biden administration since day one has done nothing but pander to the Iranians [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=127.56s)]
*  and give them resources so that their proxies can carry out these types of attacks on our [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=132.06s)]
*  troops and these atrocities that we're seeing going on in Israel right now, in Gaza. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=137.0s)]
*  So I do not have any trust or confidence that we have the leadership in the White House [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=142.06s)]
*  or the Pentagon to do what needs to be done. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=146.4s)]
*  But we better do something, and we better do it fast. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=149.08s)]
*  We need to respond to this on behalf of the troops that have been attacked, and we need [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=151.06s)]
*  to provide the strong support that our ally Israel needs from us. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=156.36s)]
*  And there is a fine line to walk here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=159.44s)]
*  Two dozen U.S. troops have already been injured in drone and missile attacks on our U.S. bases [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=161.4s)]
*  in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=167.86s)]
*  So what would an appropriate response to that be? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=168.96s)]
*  Well, I don't know exactly what that would look like. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=172.72s)]
*  But it needs to be decisive, and it needs to be very clear that it's in response to [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=181.35999999999999s)]
*  If you come after and attack American troops, there needs to be a price to be paid. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  So we know, without a doubt, that these are Iranian proxies. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=185.28s)]
*  They are funded, trained and equipped by Iran. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=189.92s)]
*  So this response needs to be directed at Iran, and it's at the—not just their proxies, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=192.83999999999997s)]
*  but at other Iranian assets. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  And so—you know, but it needs to happen quickly. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=199.76s)]
*  I mean, this is—it's embarrassing for our country. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=202.72s)]
*  It sends the wrong message to our other enemies around the world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=204.79999999999998s)]
*  Finally, you are calling for Rashida Tlaib to be banned from classified intelligence [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  briefings that you all get there in Congress. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  This, after her repeated comments, tripling down on so many things involving the Israel-Hamas [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  conflict, specifically the hospital bombing, how dangerous is it for someone so anti-Israel [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  to have a security clearance in the midst of this war? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=223.88s)]
*  Twenty seconds to you, Congressman. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=226.6s)]
*  Well, look, she's incredibly dangerous. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  She's out there spreading misinformation that is going to get people killed. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=231.4s)]
*  It may, in fact, have already got people killed. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=234.8s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  We had a leader of a synagogue in Detroit that was stabbed to death. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=237.48000000000002s)]
*  It could be related to this. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  We don't know that for sure. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  But odds are that it was. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=241.76000000000002s)]
*  And so this is dangerous rhetoric from someone who's in Congress. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=243.12s)]
*  And we need to stop this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=245.96s)]
*  We need to stop it immediately. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=246.96s)]
*  She needs to be held accountable, and Democrats need to call her out. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=247.96s)]
*  Authorities in Detroit saying the synagogue attack was not related, but again, all the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=251.56s)]
*  details are not yet out. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=255.48000000000002s)]
*  Congressman Ronny Jackson, we appreciate your time and insight. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=257.12s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=260.0s)]
*  We're going to talk to your folks and friends right now. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3UnDj0H2rc&t=261.0s)]
