# Chris Christie: Lack of American strength has led to this moment
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8)
*  Fox News alert as we approach the top of a new hour you are looking live at Gaza City [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=0.0s)]
*  where the death toll continues to rise in Israel as the fighting rages on. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=5.62s)]
*  We do know at this hour per the White House the president is expected to be speaking with [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=13.0s)]
*  our American allies although the president is not expected to be seen or heard from for [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=17.66s)]
*  the remainder of the day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=23.12s)]
*  We are also awaiting Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=24.48s)]
*  The Israeli prime minister is expected to give an update any moment now on the ongoing [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=27.48s)]
*  war. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=32.64s)]
*  We are told that he is now delayed a bit although we had no official time at which he was expected [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=33.64s)]
*  to speak. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=38.92s)]
*  So we are waiting that at any moment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=39.92s)]
*  Meanwhile let's bring in 2024 presidential candidate Chris Christie. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=42.28s)]
*  Thank you very much sir for joining us. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=46.3s)]
*  Can you please weigh in on the moment? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=47.8s)]
*  Look I think that one of the things that we are seeing here is that the lack of American [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  strength all around the world has led to this moment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  You know when you saw the miserable failed withdrawal from Afghanistan it sent a sign [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=62.379999999999995s)]
*  of weakness around the rest of the world to our adversaries. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=68.52s)]
*  Then you saw our hand wringing and our delay on supporting the fighters in Ukraine against [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=72.68s)]
*  Russia. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=79.24s)]
*  We show weakness and deterrence. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=81.6s)]
*  And now we have Israel attacked because if you are Iran and you look at what we did in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=84.2s)]
*  Afghanistan, you look at what we failed to do there and we failed to do so far in Ukraine, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=88.76s)]
*  you figure this is the time to take a shot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=94.6s)]
*  And the fact that the president hasn't been heard from today to be talking about this [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=96.96s)]
*  hostage crisis that we have now in the Middle East with Americans not only having lost their [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=101.2s)]
*  lives but now being held captive. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=107.52s)]
*  This is when the president has to send a very clear and unmistakable message to those folks [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=110.2s)]
*  around the world about what our response will be if Americans are further harmed. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=115.08s)]
*  Governor to that point about the message that we are sending around the world, I thought [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=120.72s)]
*  several statements and tweets from members of the squad on the left of the Democratic [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  Party bared airing out today. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  This from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=135.84s)]
*  An immediate ceasefire and de-escalation is urgently needed to save lives. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=138.76s)]
*  Congresswoman Cori Bush, I urge an immediate ceasefire and de-escalation to prevent further [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=144.0s)]
*  loss of life. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Ilhan Omar, we need to call for de-escalation and ceasefire. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  And then this from Rashida Tlaib. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=153.72s)]
*  As long as our country provides billions in unconditional funding to support the apartheid [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=155.88s)]
*  government, this heartbreaking cycle of violence will continue. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=160.88s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=165.64s)]
*  What I say to that are these are people who have no business, absolutely no business being [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=169.16s)]
*  listened to or respected regarding what America's role in the world is and what Israel's role [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=174.04s)]
*  is as the only democracy in the Middle East. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=179.4s)]
*  Look, you cannot have terrorists like Hamas launch a type of attack against innocent civilians [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=182.84s)]
*  that you saw launched this weekend and then say it's time now after those murders for [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=189.22s)]
*  de-escalation and a lack of violence. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=194.56s)]
*  Where were their calls for that while this was going on? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=197.84s)]
*  The fact is that Israel has an absolute right and obligation to defend itself and to take [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=200.76s)]
*  out these folks in Gaza who have perpetrated this slaughter on civilians. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=207.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure you've seen the video, John, at the music festival of innocent young people [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=216.0s)]
*  there to listen to music who are being slaughtered and kidnapped by terrorists. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=223.2s)]
*  And so these folks are Israel zealots. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=229.83999999999997s)]
*  They are against Israel. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=234.48s)]
*  They are pro-Palestinian folks who believe that any action by a Palestinian is justified. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=236.64s)]
*  And I just ignore what they have to say. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  A couple of things crossing the wire right now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=245.04s)]
*  Hezbollah has announced a second member has been killed in the Israeli shelling on Lebanon. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=247.16s)]
*  And this, Governor Christie, Hamas official says they are open to discussions over a truce [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=252.88s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=262.24s)]
*  That crossing right now, how should that be interpreted and treated considering we are [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=263.48s)]
*  about to hear from Benjamin Netanyahu, who says we will not negotiate? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=268.12s)]
*  No, look, this is not the moment to engage in that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=273.96s)]
*  The reason why the Hamas leaders are saying that is because they sucker-punched Israel, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=277.68s)]
*  killed hundreds of people, and now they say, OK, now we'd like to go back to play the way [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  it used to be. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  No, they've changed the field of play now. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  And the Israelis have an absolute right to defend themselves and to ferret out and eliminate [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  those people in Hamas who perpetrated this horrible attack. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=301.2s)]
*  Let's not forget, the Iranians clearly here were supplying both hardware and strategy. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=306.2s)]
*  I think the Biden White House's denial of that is just them trying to cover their rear [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=313.8s)]
*  ends because they gave $6 billion over to the Iranians just a few weeks ago. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  And this excuse from the administration that that money is only supposed to go to humanitarian [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=323.84000000000003s)]
*  aid, let me deal with that directly. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=327.56s)]
*  Money is fungible. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=329.92s)]
*  So they say it's only going to be on food. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=331.6s)]
*  Well, any money that the Iranians were going to spend on food, they now have a fund for [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=337.44s)]
*  They can use that money to support terrorism. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=338.44s)]
*  This idea that somehow the money hasn't left the account and all these other excuses, they [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=340.48s)]
*  gave comfort to terrorists and they gave financing to terrorists. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=344.88000000000005s)]
*  Money is fungible. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=349.32000000000005s)]
*  And there's no question that money that they didn't have access to before helped in this [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=350.72s)]
*  attack. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=355.8s)]
*  You know, whether or not the money was fungible or not, Governor, I think the fact that Iran [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=356.8s)]
*  may have been plotting with Hezbollah on Hamas to attack Israel at the same time it [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=362.8s)]
*  was making a deal with Joe Biden sticks in a lot of people's craw. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  Governor, thanks for being with us. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=371.16s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=372.48s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=373.48s)]
*  It should stick in people's craws. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=374.48s)]
*  Too naive in Washington, D.C., both on the Hill and at the White House. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=377.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you very much, Governor. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=382.2s)]
*  Thanks, Governor. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=383.2s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=384.2s)]
*  I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3gJw_8H8W8&t=385.2s)]
