# These are 'pro-terrorist' mobs undermining Israel and Western values: Shahar Azani
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU)
*  For more on all of this, let's bring in Shahar Azani, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=0.0s)]
*  former Israeli diplomat and former spokesperson [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=3.1s)]
*  for the Israeli Consulate in New York. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=6.0s)]
*  I'm baffled, frankly, at some of these anti-Israel protests [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=9.0s)]
*  and the methodology that they are taking, you know, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=14.0s)]
*  trying to keep people from going out [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=17.0s)]
*  and doing their holiday shopping. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=19.0s)]
*  It doesn't seem like a very efficient way [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=21.0s)]
*  to accomplish your protest, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=25.0s)]
*  but I want to get your thoughts on it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=26.0s)]
*  What are they doing? What's behind it? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=27.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you for having me, John. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=28.9s)]
*  You're absolutely correct. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=31.9s)]
*  There isn't much logic in making themselves more hated [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=32.9s)]
*  by the majority of the American public [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=36.9s)]
*  that's already in support of civilization versus barbarism, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=38.9s)]
*  but there is a greater issue here at hand. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=42.9s)]
*  When you think about what happened to the Palestinians [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=44.9s)]
*  and to the Gaza Strip, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=48.9s)]
*  the reason why the Gaza Strip is in such a catastrophic situation [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=49.9s)]
*  is the evil terrorist organization Hamas. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=53.9s)]
*  So if you really do care about the Palestinians, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=56.8s)]
*  then you should demand that Hamas be removed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=59.8s)]
*  from any kind of control over Palestinian lives. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=62.8s)]
*  And indeed, John, the IDF soldiers, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=65.8s)]
*  as we're making our way into the Gaza Strip [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=68.8s)]
*  and the Hamas' triangle hold over many Gazans is removed, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=70.8s)]
*  there are quite a few of those Gazans [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=74.8s)]
*  who come forth to the IDF thanking them for being there [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=76.8s)]
*  and expressing the relief that Hamas is away from them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=80.8s)]
*  So this is not pro-Palestinian. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=83.8s)]
*  This is not pro-Palestinian. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=85.7s)]
*  This is pro-terrorist mob who are interested in defacing [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=87.7s)]
*  and undermining not just Israel, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=91.7s)]
*  but also the West values and anti-the United States of America. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=93.7s)]
*  In Alexandria's report just now, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=97.7s)]
*  she had that one interview with a guy in Chicago [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=99.7s)]
*  who says the Biden administration and the Congress and the Senate [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=102.7s)]
*  have blood on their hands for supporting what's going on in Gaza. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=106.7s)]
*  I wonder if that guy was watching television on October 7th [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=111.7s)]
*  or October 8th. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=115.7s)]
*  Well, you know, so many of them don't really care about the facts, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=117.7s)]
*  but rather, you know, whether it's willful ignorance [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=121.7s)]
*  or whether it's malice. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=124.7s)]
*  And we're also witnessing, John, the tragedy of the TikTok generation [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=126.7s)]
*  where we're seeing support for the Bin Laden letter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=130.7s)]
*  So there are a lot of issues that we have to contend with as a society. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=133.7s)]
*  And I'll even mention to you, John, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=136.7s)]
*  the report that was published today about Hillpress High School [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=138.7s)]
*  in Queens, New York, where a teacher who dared to go to the March for Israel [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=142.6s)]
*  in Washington, D.C., and posted about it on social media [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=148.6s)]
*  was harangued by a mob in the school. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=152.6s)]
*  I mean, it's unbelievable the level of depravity that we're reaching [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=156.6s)]
*  and it's a warning sign for us all. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=165.6s)]
*  It tells us that we have a lot to deal with right here in the U.S. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=167.6s)]
*  when it comes to educating our public. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=170.5s)]
*  Yeah, we talk about low-information voters. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=172.5s)]
*  These are low-information protesters in my book. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=176.5s)]
*  But how do you turn that around? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=179.5s)]
*  I mean, there seems to be so much animosity directed toward Israel. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=181.5s)]
*  How do you fix that? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=185.5s)]
*  I'll tell you, I have to tell you, John, that the truth is [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=187.5s)]
*  that the louder they are, the smaller they are. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=190.5s)]
*  And we could see it during the Thanksgiving parade in New York [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=193.5s)]
*  where you had a couple of anarchists, pro-terror, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=196.5s)]
*  who came and disrupted the parade. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=199.4s)]
*  And the only sound you heard, John, was them being booed [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=201.4s)]
*  by so many people around them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=205.4s)]
*  The truth is that I am actually heartened by the support of the majority [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=207.4s)]
*  of the justice and peace-loving people of the United States [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=212.4s)]
*  and around the world who are showing support [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=215.4s)]
*  because they're making a lot of noise, but their impact is absolutely zero. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=218.4s)]
*  And Israel is extremely determined to move forward [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=222.4s)]
*  not just with releasing those innocent hostages from Gaza, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=226.3s)]
*  but also eradicating Hamas, making sure that it's no longer [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=230.3s)]
*  on our southern border because the attack that came from Hamas, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=234.3s)]
*  Hamas is an Iranian proxy, and the attack was against Israel [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=238.3s)]
*  and the United States' foreign policy, undermining the prospects of peace [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=242.3s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and other moderate Arab countries. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=246.3s)]
*  Remember, that was the main conversation only a few weeks [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=249.3s)]
*  before the attack at the United Nations. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=252.3s)]
*  It seems like the Iranians don't like to get their own hands dirty. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=255.2s)]
*  They like to send their proxies out to do all their dirty work for them. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=259.2s)]
*  You know, we say, John, that the Iranians will fight [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=264.2s)]
*  until the last drop of blood of Yemenite Houthis, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=267.2s)]
*  of Palestinians, of Shiite Lebanese, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=270.2s)]
*  but you're absolutely correct. But make no mistake, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=273.2s)]
*  the Iranians are involved in everything and anything [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=276.2s)]
*  that's happening in the region, in the continuous destabilization [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=279.2s)]
*  in the Middle East, and it goes far beyond. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=282.2s)]
*  It's a terrorist attack, it's a terrorist attack, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=285.2s)]
*  it's a terrorist attack against the Hezbollah, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=288.2s)]
*  and it's an operation of the drug trafficking networks [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=291.2s)]
*  in South America that reach our borders. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=295.2s)]
*  So all of this is before us, and like I always say, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=298.2s)]
*  post-October 7th, not just Israel has changed, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=301.2s)]
*  but the general world will change in its policies vis-a-vis such evil actors. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=304.2s)]
*  Shahar Azani, we appreciate your insights tonight. Thank you. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=309.2s)]
*  Check out our Fox News YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuON2Ry8zmU&t=313.1s)]
