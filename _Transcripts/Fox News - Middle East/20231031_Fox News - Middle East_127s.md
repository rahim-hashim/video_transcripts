# Ret. Navy captain warns Israel has to be ‘very cautious’ about this
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4)
*  Let's bring in retired Navy captain Brent Sadler. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=0.0s)]
*  Difficult to know, Brent, where to start today because there's so much going on. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  But why don't we start with this attack on the Jabalia refugee camp? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=6.4s)]
*  And an indication now is the tempo of operations increases, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=10.32s)]
*  that potentially civilians will be increasingly in harm's way, because Hamas uses them that way. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=14.4s)]
*  No, absolutely. I've been listening to the commentary and the press briefings [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=21.44s)]
*  for the last hour or so. And I think what's missing in that is that the first and foremost [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=25.2s)]
*  is that the Israeli military is going after military objectives or for military effects, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  not targeting civilians indiscriminately or discriminately, as Hamas has done. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  So the military objective seems to be clear by the body count of Hamas warfighters that they [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=40.800000000000004s)]
*  killed in that attack, as well as taking out leadership. And I think that's the number one [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  priority in the operational aspect of this ground incursion. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=51.040000000000006s)]
*  Brent, can I ask you, though, what comes from all of this? Because there's going to be a reaction. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=54.8s)]
*  We know that we just heard from the Turkish prime minister a few days ago, very, very upset. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=60.559999999999995s)]
*  Obviously, thousands of people protesting in that country, very upset [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=66.08s)]
*  because they feel like civilians are being targeted. We know Iran is watching and waiting. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=69.92s)]
*  We're watching Hezbollah to see if they attack next. How quickly could things, these proxies, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=75.28s)]
*  react to something like the IDF going after a target like Al-Shifa hospital? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think they already are. It's not a question of if. It's already happening. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  And I think it's probably going to continue. Hamas does have quite a good network for strategic [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=95.76s)]
*  communications and to try and win the propaganda war. So Israel has to be very cautious in losing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=100.88000000000001s)]
*  support in the United States, I think, first and foremost in how it goes forward. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=107.04s)]
*  All right, Brent Sadler, great to catch up with you. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=110.88s)]
*  And thanks for hanging through all the briefings, too. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jnR-mtD7g4&t=114.39999999999999s)]
