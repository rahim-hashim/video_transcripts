# 'THIS IS JIHAD': Woman's family shown on video being taken by Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI)
*  In the meantime, at least four Israelis were taken hostage by Hamas over the weekend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=0.0s)]
*  They were killed shortly after that, according to the terror group. A newly surfaced video shows [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=5.12s)]
*  Hamas militants walking with those civilians whose hands are tied behind their backs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=10.48s)]
*  In another video, four lifeless bodies with the same physical characteristics as the hostages are [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  seen in the street. Dead. Our next guest recognized her mother's cousin as one of the hostage victims [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=22.08s)]
*  in that video. Liel Silfer joins us right now. Liel, good morning to you. Good morning. I know [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=31.36s)]
*  this is going to be a tough story to talk about. Your mother's cousin, Kinneret. Yeah. You saw her [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=37.12s)]
*  in one of those videos. You knew she was alive. She had been taken hostage. Then what happened? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=44.8s)]
*  She texted us that morning. She was in the house with her husband, her daughter, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  her son and her daughter-in-law and her little granddaughter, three years old. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=61.04s)]
*  They were all there celebrating the holiday. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=64.4s)]
*  And she said she was safe. And then we started seeing videos from the terrorists that she'd been [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=68.72s)]
*  taken. Reports from her husband that their daughter was taken, their son, their daughter-in-law, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=75.68s)]
*  their granddaughter. And we just kept searching for news and we didn't know for so many days. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=84.08000000000001s)]
*  And then I saw the video online and I had to tell my family in Israel [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=90.64000000000001s)]
*  that I had seen Kinneret laying on the ground lifeless. And we still haven't recovered her body yet. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=98.4s)]
*  In addition to that terrible story, her son and his wife and their daughter, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  right there, we're looking at an image right there, they were also taken. They were put in a car by [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=117.76s)]
*  Hamas. They were. Then what happened? So they tied Alon's hands. He's Kinneret's son. They tied him [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=123.6s)]
*  together. They pushed the three of them into a truck with four terrorists. They put another [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=132.56s)]
*  member of their kibbutz in the trunk and drove off towards Gaza. Along the way, they saw a tank and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=137.52s)]
*  the terrorists stopped the car and they got out. And at that moment, Alon and Yarden knew that if [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=144.72s)]
*  they didn't do something, they would be as good as dead. And so they jumped. They ran from the car, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=150.64s)]
*  Yarden holding on to her three-year-old daughter Geffen. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  And when she couldn't hold Geffen any longer, she passed her to Alon, whose hands were still tied, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=162.95999999999998s)]
*  and they just ran. Alon hid in that field with his little girl for 24 hours [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=167.83999999999997s)]
*  until he stopped hearing gunfire and shouting and searching and made his way back to the kibbutz and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=176.0s)]
*  thank God they're alive. But Yarden had to hide somewhere else and we don't know what happened to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=181.04s)]
*  her. Alon went back the next day and searched and searched and we haven't found her body [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=188.16s)]
*  or any sign of her. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=197.36s)]
*  Or any sign of her. And we have to assume the worst has happened. She's been taken hostage [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=198.64s)]
*  in Gaza. She's with Carmel and so many others, not just Israelis, but Americans and citizens [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  from all over the world. The not knowing has got to be the hard part. You know, you don't know if [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=218.88s)]
*  she is alive. You don't know if she's dead. If she's alive, which is good news, the bad news is [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=228.16s)]
*  she's a human shield. Hamas has told us what they're doing. They've told us for years. This isn't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=233.52s)]
*  resistance fighters. Calling it war crimes is even charitable. This is jihad. There are no rules in [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=244.0s)]
*  jihad. They're raping women in fields. They're beheading babies. They're executing the elderly [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=251.68s)]
*  in the street. They're taking back to Gaza to use as human shield. It's appalling. And the world [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=258.56s)]
*  has to step up and get these hostages out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=270.71999999999997s)]
*  How are we going to do that? I have heard Daily Mail has got a story right now that apparently [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=274.47999999999996s)]
*  Delta Force and SEAL Team 6 are in an adjacent country. And if the Israeli military says we [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=283.68s)]
*  need the American help, they could come and perhaps, and it's pure speculation, help extract some [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=290.96s)]
*  of the hostages. We also understand apparently hostage negotiation from the United States. We've [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=297.68s)]
*  got some great organizations, the FBI, the military. They can do it. And they're working [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=304.88s)]
*  with their Israeli counterparts. But as you know, Liel, the problem is as we look at Gaza City, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=309.68s)]
*  there's a real good chance that the wife, your family member is underneath one of those buildings [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=316.24s)]
*  that has not been hit yet. And as much as you want justice for your family, you got to know [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=323.6s)]
*  that she could be under, you know, at the bottom of the next tower that gets blown up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=332.72s)]
*  It's unimaginable. It's the worst nightmare possible. And not only that, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=340.16s)]
*  we're sending my cousins, my friends who've been called up into the reserves into Gaza to try and [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=346.72s)]
*  extract them. This is not the end of the death toll. There will be more to come. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=351.28s)]
*  It's unimaginable. And I pray, I pray that Carmel and Yarden will come home safely. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=358.47999999999996s)]
*  But you're exactly right. Hamas will stop at nothing. They are using these people as pawns. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=368.79999999999995s)]
*  They don't want a two-state solution. They want the final solution. And they don't care how many [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=378.64s)]
*  Jews, how many Americans, how many of their own people have to die in order for them to wage [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=385.92s)]
*  their jihad. Liel, thank you for telling your story and telling us about your mother's cousin. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=395.92s)]
*  Thank you. We hope they find your missing family. Thank you. We're going to take a break. Right back. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=234tum1ILFI&t=404.24s)]
