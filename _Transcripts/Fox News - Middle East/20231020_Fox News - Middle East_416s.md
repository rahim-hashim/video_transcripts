# Netanyahu spokesman: The terrorists' timing was no coincidence
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k)
*  Tal Heinrich, spokeswoman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, joins us now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=0.0s)]
*  Tal, it's good to see you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=3.84s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=4.84s)]
*  Let me get you to respond to something that Yoav Galant said just a moment ago. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=6.44s)]
*  He said that there will be a different security regime in Gaza. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=9.8s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=13.84s)]
*  So as we stated, the goal of the operation in Gaza right now, of this war that we didn't [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=16.16s)]
*  start, we didn't even expect, we were dragged into it by Hamas when they carried out the [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=21.2s)]
*  October 7th massacre and butchered 1,400 Israelis. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=26.24s)]
*  We said that the goal is to dismantle Hamas' military capabilities and to make sure that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=30.919999999999998s)]
*  by the end of this, they will also lack the motivation to ever hurt us as they did. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=35.28s)]
*  We will also take out their governance bodies and we will make sure that Hamas will be no [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=40.2s)]
*  longer in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=46.0s)]
*  We will change the reality there. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=47.68s)]
*  Now there are different contingency plans that are being discussed in Israeli circles [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=49.64s)]
*  and with international and American counterparts right now about the day after, but we're not [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=55.24s)]
*  there yet. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  Right now we are very determined to accomplish this goal. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  We are a nation in deep, deep pain, as President Biden said yesterday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=66.12s)]
*  He was here and he witnessed the pain because he met with some of these families who lost [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=70.28s)]
*  loved ones. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=74.0s)]
*  But nevertheless, we are very determined and our cause is very clear and is very just. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  In terms of this different security arrangement, and I know that that's for the day after, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=85.16s)]
*  but I assume that that's what this quadrilateral summit in Amman, Jordan, between President [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=90.04s)]
*  Biden, King Abdullah, Al Sisi of Egypt, and Mahmoud Abbas was supposed to be about? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, obviously, our American counterparts are discussing with different players in the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=101.08s)]
*  region. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=107.88s)]
*  We are not part of some of these discussions. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=108.68s)]
*  We are holding different discussions with regional partners as well behind the scenes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=111.64s)]
*  But once we will complete the mission of dismantling Hamas, I can tell you, John, that also other [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=117.16s)]
*  actors across the region will understand that a strong Israel, an Israel that took out this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=122.8s)]
*  terrorist, monstrous regime, also serves their interests. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=129.16s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=132.6s)]
*  It is not coincidental that this massacre took place right before when Israel was on the [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=133.4s)]
*  brink of a diplomatic breakthrough with Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=139.36s)]
*  Peace and calm in the region is the enemy of these terrorists. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=142.4s)]
*  That's the worst nightmare, in fact. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=146.44000000000003s)]
*  The idea of what comes next is something I'll be discussing with General David Petraeus [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  later on today here on Fox. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=153.92000000000002s)]
*  Let me ask you about the ground operation, because we had the prime minister yesterday [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=156.0s)]
*  out of the front lines with the troops, Joav Galant, the defense minister, was also out [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=159.52s)]
*  there. Galant said, if you haven't seen the inside of Gaza yet, you soon will. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  I take it that a ground operation is imminent. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=169.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, I cannot divulge any information moving ahead about military and operational strategy. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=172.8s)]
*  But what I can tell you is that when the prime minister went down south to meet with some of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=177.8s)]
*  these brigades, he saw and he described that he saw the fire in their eyes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=182.48000000000002s)]
*  Some of these soldiers that you saw, they lost friends over the past, you know, 14 days, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=188.04s)]
*  but they are so determined and they have a very strong, resilient nation behind them. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=194.8s)]
*  You know why? Because, John, Israel is a small nation and everyone in this country either [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  knows someone who serves on the front lines, someone who is taking part in the national [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  effort as part of the reserve force. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=207.4s)]
*  We mobilize many forces or someone who was abducted. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=209.24s)]
*  We have two hundred and three Israelis still being held captive in Gaza, someone who was [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=212.96s)]
*  killed or someone who was injured. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=217.48000000000002s)]
*  We're all in this together and we will win. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=220.4s)]
*  On the subject, Tal, of the hostages, Russia is reportedly in contact with Hamas in an [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=223.2s)]
*  attempt to free those hostages. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=229.4s)]
*  The Russian ambassador to Israel saying in a statement that was published by a Russian [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=230.96s)]
*  newspaper, quote, Of course, we have contacts with representatives of Hamas. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=234.68s)]
*  And first of all, they are aimed at rescuing the hostages from the places where they are [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=239.12s)]
*  now captured by Hamas militants on the first day of the, frankly speaking, terrorist attack [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=243.28s)]
*  on Israeli civilians. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=248.8s)]
*  Israel has a nominal relationship with Russia. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=251.44s)]
*  Do you want do you need their help on this issue? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=254.16s)]
*  Well, I cannot comment about anything that's been said or reported allegedly happening [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=258.28s)]
*  between Russia and Hamas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=263.08s)]
*  What I do know is that Prime Minister Netanyahu has spoken to President Putin of Russia a [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=264.64s)]
*  few days ago regarding the hostages. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=269.12s)]
*  All we say and we keep repeating it every day. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=271.68s)]
*  That is one of the top priorities of this operation. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=274.36s)]
*  We are calling on Hamas to unconditionally release them. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=276.64s)]
*  And we're hoping that many in the international community will join our demand and back it [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=279.76s)]
*  when we say that we want the Red Cross to visit them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=285.44s)]
*  This is the number one humanitarian pressing issue in Gaza right now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  The state of the hostages. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=293.03999999999996s)]
*  We will bring them back. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=294.8s)]
*  All right, we are looking at their live pictures, by the way, just a second ago from up at [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=297.4s)]
*  the border between Israel and Lebanon, where things continue to heat up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=302.03999999999996s)]
*  We'll get to that in just a second. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=308.08s)]
*  But first, let's listen to what President Biden said last night in his address to the [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=310.28s)]
*  nation. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=313.92s)]
*  Tomorrow, I'm going to send to Congress an urgent budget request to fund America's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=316.88s)]
*  national security needs to support our critical partners, including Israel and Ukraine. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=321.68s)]
*  It's a smart investment that's going to pay dividends for American security for [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  generations. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=331.4s)]
*  If we walk away and let Putin erase Ukraine's independence, would be aggressives around [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=332.32s)]
*  the world would be emboldened. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=337.16s)]
*  So there was a speech that was not just about Israel, but about Ukraine as well. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=341.12s)]
*  And and and just finishes out here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=345.12s)]
*  Did the president pay enough attention to the situation in Israel? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=347.72s)]
*  Well, the president was here and we were very grateful for his visit. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=352.20000000000005s)]
*  The fact that he flew into a war zone, this is unprecedented and it speaks volumes of [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=355.76000000000005s)]
*  the support that we are receiving from the American people and the bipartisan support [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=361.40000000000003s)]
*  also that we're seeing in the U.S. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=366.2s)]
*  Congress. It is very important that the United States is leading this with its global [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=367.4s)]
*  moral leadership, because when you guys are setting the tone, others follow. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=372.47999999999996s)]
*  And just like was the case with ISIS when we saw an international coalition being formed [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=377.84s)]
*  to defeat this monstrous organization, that is the case with Hamas. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=382.36s)]
*  And it's happening right in front of our eyes. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  So we are very grateful for the support that we are receiving from the American people. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=389.28s)]
*  All right, Tal, Henrik, we will stand by. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=393.76s)]
*  We will watch along with you. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=395.52s)]
*  Thank you very much. Appreciate it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=396.88s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-041XgIKU5k&t=398.88s)]
