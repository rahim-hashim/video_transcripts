# 'THIS IS A TEST': Retired Lt. Col Bob Maginnis warns Iran is orchestrating proxy attacks
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4)
*  So, is this response enough to deter attacks on our troops for the future? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=0.0s)]
*  The read now from retired U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Bob McGuinness and former Deputy National [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=4.46s)]
*  Security Adviser Victoria Coats. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=9.540000000000001s)]
*  Now, Victoria, I want to start with you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=10.94s)]
*  Three troops injured, one critical. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=13.14s)]
*  Are these attacks—I mean, they seem to keep happening. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=15.36s)]
*  Is this about a lack of respect for the U.S.? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=20.22s)]
*  It's good to be with you, Edward. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=22.54s)]
*  Hope you had a wonderful Christmas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=23.54s)]
*  And clearly, this has been bound to happen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=25.94s)]
*  We've had over 100 attacks on American installations and personnel since the middle of October. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=28.82s)]
*  And eventually, they're going to get lucky, and they're going to hit some guys. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=35.2s)]
*  And in this case, we took some pretty bad—some pretty bad injuries. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=38.8s)]
*  And clearly, what the president did overnight has not dissuaded them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=42.2s)]
*  I mean, these things are all related, and the hootie are still escalating in the Red [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=45.68s)]
*  Sea. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=49.72s)]
*  This is a big problem. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=50.72s)]
*  So, Bob, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin says in a statement, he says this, quote, we will—while [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=51.72s)]
*  we do not seek to escalate conflict in the region, we are committed and fully prepared [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=57.64s)]
*  to take further necessary measures to protect our troops or our people and facilities. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=62.76s)]
*  Now, Iranian proxies have attacked U.S. positions more than 103 times since October 17th. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=68.06s)]
*  What message does it send when you hear that statement and we've seen this many attacks? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=74.94s)]
*  Well, the Iranians have a lot of experience doing this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=79.78s)]
*  for certainly since 1979, when they had their revolution over there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=85.1s)]
*  And so, essentially, what they're doing is pushing up against the line with us. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=91.28s)]
*  And they're creating a scenario in such a way that is really hurting our readiness, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=97.6s)]
*  jeopardizing the lives of our troops. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=104.08s)]
*  And I think the ayatollah sitting in Tehran says, look, the Americans aren't going to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=106.53999999999999s)]
*  do anything serious. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=111.08s)]
*  If they did, then we'd go after the IRGC or some of the Iranian headquarters rather [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=112.22s)]
*  than just go after these proxies that are going to continue to play this game with us. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=119.4s)]
*  So, Bob, I wanted to get your take on this, being from the Army. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=123.66s)]
*  Twelve drones were brought down in the last 10 hours. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=128.1s)]
*  You probably heard the breaking news at the top of the show. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=131.5s)]
*  Is that a test of the system? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=135.06s)]
*  Are they trying to see what will overwhelm us to get through? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=137.9s)]
*  You know, we have three cruisers at least in that area. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=142.6s)]
*  We have the Ike USS Carrier in the Gulf of Aden. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=145.96s)]
*  And, of course, we have facilities in nearby Djibouti across the strait. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=150.04s)]
*  So the Houthis are indeed testing us, and they're seeing whether or not we have the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=154.72s)]
*  capability not only to go after drones, but, of course, the Houthis have been using long-range [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  ballistic missiles even against Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  So yes, this is a test. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=167.76s)]
*  Iran is, of course, behind it, orchestrating this whole thing. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=169.94s)]
*  You know, there's every indication that they have intel in the area that is really feeding [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=173.29999999999998s)]
*  the Houthis launching of drones and ballistic missiles. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  So the Amerisk, the shipping container company, said that they would resume operations now [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=182.7s)]
*  in the Red Sea. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=188.5s)]
*  We've seen this attack now on a ship. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  The MSC containership is called today, said that it was attacked in that area now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=192.7s)]
*  No one was injured in that attack. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=200.51999999999998s)]
*  Coalitionship did respond to that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=202.92s)]
*  So, Victoria, you know, can they call this Operation Prosperity Guardian a success? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=205.0s)]
*  Well, not really right now. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=210.67999999999998s)]
*  And we had some reports over the weekend that a lot of our European partners were pulling [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=213.16s)]
*  out. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=217.12s)]
*  And to Colonel McGuinness's point, I think what we need to do is take a strong targeted [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=218.12s)]
*  action. Nobody wants to see the United States dragged in to a broader conflict. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=222.48s)]
*  But do what the Israelis reportedly did in Syria overnight. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=227.56s)]
*  Take out a senior IRGC official outside of Damascus who had no business being there. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=232.2s)]
*  He was posted as a diplomat at their embassy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=237.2s)]
*  I mean, hardly. So if you can take a strong action like that and push back, I think you'd [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  see the Houthis stop. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=244.68s)]
*  But until that happens, they're just going to keep trying. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=245.76s)]
*  And in the last 30 seconds that we have, Bob, you agree, is that we have to take an action [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=249.32s)]
*  possibly against Iran or in Iran something symbolic of Iran? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  Certainly the Quds Force, IRGC. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=259.76s)]
*  You know, Reagan did it in 1986 when he went after Mohammed Gaddafi. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  And he also hurt the Iranians. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=268.76s)]
*  Until they're hurt, Edward, they are not going to stop using their proxies to really irritate [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=271.12s)]
*  us. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=277.0s)]
*  And in the next few weeks, it could be much worse. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=278.12s)]
*  So we need to be prepared to do more than what we've done at this point. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=279.4s)]
*  Think of Soleimani when we killed him in Baghdad. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=283.72s)]
*  That was a very clear message to the Ayatollah. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=286.26s)]
*  I think we could do the same. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=288.48s)]
*  Bob, Victoria, I appreciate the insight. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=290.16s)]
*  I'm sure we're going to be talking about this again, unfortunately, but I appreciate it. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=292.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=296.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HC7LoxsPuS4&t=297.56s)]
