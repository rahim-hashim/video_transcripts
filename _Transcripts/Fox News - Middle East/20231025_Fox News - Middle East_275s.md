*  Families of us hostages being held by Hamas lobbying lawmakers on Capitol Hill urging lawmakers to do more to get them home [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=6.94s)]
*  moments ago Israel's national security adviser praising Qatar for its [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=14.76s)]
*  Negotiation efforts saying quote I'm pleased to say that Qatar is becoming an essential party and stakeholder in the facilitation of humanitarian [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=18.78s)]
*  Solutions but cutters diplomatic efforts are crucial at this time, right? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=25.84s)]
*  But critics are quick to point out that they also reportedly are harboring notorious Hamas leaders [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=30.64s)]
*  Including the top official Ismail Anaya the Gulf nation also gives Hamas control [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=35.56s)]
*  Control Gaza 30 million dollars every month in aid in a new op-ed [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  Our next guest says Qatar must pick a side and expel the terror leaders or the United States must do that for them [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=46.64s)]

*  Yaakov the cats [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=59.239999999999995s)]
*  Mr. Katz, thanks so much for joining us [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=61.08s)]
*  Why have they been able to play a double game for this period of time? Why now is this coming under scrutiny? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=63.44s)]
*  Well Brian, this is something that Qatar has been playing for a long time [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=72.28s)]
*  It's a two-sided game and they play with both sides. They support Hamas. They harbor Hamas [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=75.52s)]
*  They let them live a life of look luxury in Doha [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=80.72s)]
*  By the way at the same time that their people in Gaza are suffering of poverty don't have basic means [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=83.8s)]
*  But they're living a life of luxury back in the capital of Qatar and they also provide money and that money we all now know [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=88.96s)]
*  Is used by Hamas to build those tunnel networks to purchase those weapons and to carry out the the horrendous? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=95.12s)]
*  Rampage on October 7th that murdered and that massacre of about 1400 Jewish Israelis inside Israel [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=101.68s)]
*  Qatar does this and they were allowed to get away with it because it was convenient and just like that tweet that you showed [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=108.36s)]
*  By Israel's national security advisor they give the terrorists on the one hand and on the other hand they say but hold on you [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=113.08s)]
*  Need us because we can facilitate communications [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=118.56s)]
*  So they kind of wink and nod at both sides and play this game and we Israel included not just America Israel included [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=120.84s)]
*  Have allowed this to go on in my view for too long [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  so Yaakov [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=131.2s)]
*  How is it that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=133.44s)]
*  1400 plus are killed in the most brutal fashion possible and the people in charge of that organization [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=135.28s)]
*  Are allowed to sit there and live this life of luxury and not only that days later greet the foreign minister of Iran [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=141.11999999999998s)]
*  I believe outside the Four Seasons and to have a look great dinner [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=148.2s)]
*  Imagine a celebratory dinner for the death and destruction they inflicted on the Israeli people [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=153.39999999999998s)]
*  Brian I was listening to you before we were talking about the attacks on US bases in Syria and Iraq and what you said is in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=159.8s)]
*  This region you have to project force and strength. That is the language that is spoken here in the Middle East until now [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=166.20000000000002s)]
*  Everyone could give us a lecture Brian. This is complicated. We need the Qataris right now [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  They can help with the negotiations for the hostages and I get it and maybe and I'm guessing that they are playing a positive role [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=178.0s)]
*  That's what I'm hearing also from the Israeli government [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=184.08s)]
*  But at the same time if we're not clear [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  This is a battle between good and evil if people are not forced to take a side and we continue to fall into the trap [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=189.16s)]
*  Of things are complicated then we will continue to lose this better [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=196.68s)]
*  It's time that we all pick a side and it's clear whose side everyone stands on including the Al Thani family [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  Which rules this opulent state of Qatar in the Persian Gulf? Yeah, I hear you [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=207.64000000000001s)]

*  Their their profile around the world the next minute. They're saying I want you to meet my Hamas leader [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=217.64s)]
*  Yeah, they're terrorist organization. Is that a beautiful suit and doesn't have great gel [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=223.68s)]
*  It's incredible that they're able to pull this off and well, hopefully it'll change and I think we're almost [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=227.56s)]
*  Hostage to the fact that we got this very vital military base there if we threaten to pull that out [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=232.92s)]
*  Do we lose influence or will that get them to change their mind real quick? I? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-5WutAylMw&t=237.89999999999998s)]
