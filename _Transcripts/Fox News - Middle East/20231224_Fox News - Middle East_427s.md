# Iran feels ‘emboldened’ because of inconsistent US response: Sen. Bill Hagerty
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA)
*  Tennessee Senator Bill Harrety joins us now live from Nashville to discuss all of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=0.0s)]
*  He's a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and also the Appropriations Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=4.5s)]
*  Senator, great to have you with us today. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=7.94s)]
*  It's good to be with you on this Christmas Eve, Shannon. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=10.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=12.64s)]
*  Okay, we'll try to get to all those things, but I want to start with some overnight news [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=13.64s)]
*  from CENTCOM about more attacks in the Red Sea. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=16.68s)]
*  They say in Saturday they took down four incoming drones to a U.S. destroyer. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=19.68s)]
*  That destroyer was then asked to come to the aid of two different commercial vessels that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=23.78s)]
*  said they came under attack or attempted attack. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=27.82s)]
*  Iran seems to be behind much of this. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=31.020000000000003s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal reporting this. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=32.9s)]
*  The direct involvement by Iranian actors in the attacks raises the stakes for Israel and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=34.74s)]
*  the U.S., which are eager to contain Tehran's role in the region and risks creating a new [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=39.38s)]
*  front in the conflict between Israel and its foes in the region, just as the U.S. is trying [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=44.84s)]
*  to stop it from escalating. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=50.64s)]
*  Do you think the Biden administration is taking the appropriate response action with regard [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=52.6s)]
*  to Iran's involvement in all of these things? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=57.36s)]
*  They're not taking a consistent response, so of course it's not appropriate. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=60.4s)]
*  That's why Iran feels emboldened. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=63.48s)]
*  What we've seen is put two aircraft carrier strike groups into the region. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=65.48s)]
*  That's a massive show of military force, but we've been highly inconsistent in terms of [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=68.62s)]
*  the way we deal with Iran from an economic standpoint and from a diplomatic standpoint. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=72.92s)]
*  From an economic standpoint, Shannon, you remember under President Trump, we put in [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=77.5s)]
*  place the maximum pressure campaign. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=80.72s)]
*  I worked on that in his administration. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=82.44s)]
*  We brought down Iran's foreign currency reserves to below $8 billion. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=84.46s)]
*  As soon as Joe Biden came into office, they stopped enforcing the sanctions. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=88.82s)]
*  Billions of dollars began to flow. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=92.86s)]
*  According to our estimates, they've enriched themselves by over $100 billion in terms of [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=93.97999999999999s)]
*  illicit oil sales, and it continues just because the Biden administration wants to appease [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=97.58s)]
*  the Iranian regime. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=102.0s)]
*  From a diplomatic standpoint, we've been sending mixed messages to Israel. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=103.66s)]
*  We talk about ceasefires. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=108.74s)]
*  We talk about sending humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  We talk about putting conditions on aid. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=112.8s)]
*  These mixed messages and the fact that we've allowed Iran to enrich itself and repopulate [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=115.52s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah and the Houthis with the weapons that they need have created this situation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=119.84s)]
*  We need to come back and snap back economic sanctions immediately on Iran. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  We need to send a clear diplomatic message. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=128.8s)]
*  That's what we need to see to get the situation to calm down. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=131.16s)]
*  We have to maintain freedom of navigation operations in the seas. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=133.34s)]
*  We cannot cede that to Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=136.96s)]
*  It's just one of the many foreign policy headaches for this administration, the serious issues [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=139.44s)]
*  that they have got to find solutions to. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=142.92s)]
*  The border, of course, that we've talked about. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=144.6s)]
*  I want to just recap where we are because late Friday, going into a holiday weekend, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=146.2s)]
*  we got new numbers on what's happening there. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  Nearly 243,000 encounters with people at the southern border illegally. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=152.76s)]
*  Highest number on November. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=157.76s)]
*  Highest November on record. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=159.64s)]
*  It's the third highest month in this current crisis. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=160.64s)]
*  We've got days where more than 12,000 people are showing up a day at the southern border. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=163.24s)]
*  A woman this week reportedly crossed in illegally from Colombia was given a 2031 date to check [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=167.16s)]
*  in with ICE. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=173.4s)]
*  One Border Patrol agent told us the people in charge have turned an entire agency of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=174.62s)]
*  courageous individuals into department store greeters. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=178.84s)]
*  This is one of the looming issues. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=183.32s)]
*  You guys have got to hammer out in January. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=185.6s)]
*  Can you tell those Border Patrol agents or the American people more broadly there are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=187.32s)]
*  substantive changes coming? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=190.96s)]
*  Shannon, you used the word crisis. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=193.44s)]
*  It couldn't be more appropriate. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  And we have been sending that message. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  In fact, every single Republican unanimously blocked movement on this Ukraine package until [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  we deal with the southern border. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  I think Chuck Schumer and Joe Biden need to get the message that Republicans are serious [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=206.36s)]
*  about this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=209.48000000000002s)]
*  We are unanimous that this has to be dealt with. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  And if you look at what's happened just since October, October the 7th, the Hamas invasion [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  took place in Israel. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=216.52s)]
*  Christopher Wray, our FBI chief, said that the number of alerts from national security [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=217.96s)]
*  standpoint have gone up like a Christmas tree since that happened. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=221.8s)]
*  They've encountered over 150 nationalities crossing our border illegally just since October. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=225.72s)]
*  We don't know who's in our nation, Shannon, but we do know this is destabilizing our country. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=231.72s)]
*  The fentanyl that's coming in is killing our kids. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=235.56s)]
*  Cities are overwhelmed and we have many, many people here on the terrorist watch list. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=238.0s)]
*  We don't know what they're going to do, yet the risk is going up exponentially. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=241.94s)]
*  We have to deal with it now. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=245.20000000000002s)]
*  We have sent that message loud and clear. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=246.20000000000002s)]
*  Negotiations took place leading up to Christmas. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  They've fallen apart. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=250.12s)]
*  The Biden administration has to understand that we are serious as Republicans. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=251.32s)]
*  We're going to stand up against this. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=254.95999999999998s)]
*  We have to make certain that we do in the 11 days that we've got when we get back into [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=256.59999999999997s)]
*  session. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=259.68s)]
*  You mentioned they've fallen apart. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=260.68s)]
*  Do you feel that it's come to a stop? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=261.68s)]
*  Are we moving backwards? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=263.76s)]
*  Is there forward progress? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=265.08s)]
*  Where are we in your assessment? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=266.32s)]
*  It's hard to say because we've got to see it all come together at once. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=267.88s)]
*  We get piecemeal language that might work, that might be one step forward, but if they [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  loosen something else, Shannon, that makes sense. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=275.58s)]
*  We've got to look at it in its entirety because the Biden administration has been clear they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=278.44s)]
*  want to destabilize the border. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=282.28s)]
*  They're encouraging as many people to flood into this nation as they possibly can, essentially [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=283.76s)]
*  to backfill the blue states where populations are leaving and help them in the calculation [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=287.6s)]
*  of congressional seats going forward and electoral votes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=291.86s)]
*  But that needs to stop. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=294.44s)]
*  The danger that they're willing to put our nation through is unconscionable. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=296.08s)]
*  The number of lives that we deal with just here in Tennessee that are lost to fentanyl, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=299.92s)]
*  2,000 to 3,000 kids this year, Shannon, will die due to fentanyl overdoses. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=303.2s)]
*  When the Biden administration is willing to look the other way while they transform America, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=307.8s)]
*  it has to stop. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=311.56s)]
*  Well, you're not suggesting they actually want our borders to be overrun and for Americans [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=312.56s)]
*  to be killed by what's coming across the border, are you? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=316.04s)]
*  I'm suggesting that they're tolerating this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=319.8s)]
*  And it's clear we already have the tools. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  President Trump proved this. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  He had the border taken down to a practical shutdown. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=325.64s)]
*  The remain in Mexico policy that's still on the books could be imposed tomorrow. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=328.52s)]
*  Title 42, they tossed that. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=333.04s)]
*  Everything that's happening right now is an acceleration of people into our nation. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=335.12s)]
*  The supplemental language that the Biden administration sent over earlier for this package that includes [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=339.36s)]
*  Ukraine, Israel, when they say border, what they've asked for is more money to more rapidly [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=343.68s)]
*  process people into our country and for the ability to transform ICE, the only law enforcement [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=348.76s)]
*  agency we have that can deport people, to transform that agency into a resettlement [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=353.96s)]
*  agency. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=358.08s)]
*  It's a shame. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=359.08s)]
*  OK, so the supplemental includes all of these very difficult conversations, but it's just [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=360.08s)]
*  part of what's waiting for you in January. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=364.42s)]
*  The New York Times puts it this way. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=365.82s)]
*  It says the Senate failed to deliver on aid to Ukraine. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATv0IlwHYQA&t=366.94s)]
