# Hamas must 'cease to exist': Sen. Tim Scott
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI)
*  With me now is Senator Tim Scott, the South Carolina senator, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=0.0s)]
*  also a Republican presidential candidate. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=4.5s)]
*  Senator, very good to have you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=7.08s)]
*  I don't know if you had a chance, sir, to listen to everything the former [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  Israeli ambassador just said, but he said that Israel's going to hang tough. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=12.94s)]
*  This attack is not going to be a tentative attack. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=16.84s)]
*  It's going to be a sweeping one with the goal being- [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=22.42s)]
*  Aggressive. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=26.54s)]
*  Destroy and annihilate Hamas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=27.26s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=29.86s)]
*  I do indeed, Neil. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  I sat down with Ambassador Herzog just this week a few days ago, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=33.8s)]
*  and his response was very clear that a proportional response is to wipe Hamas [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=37.84s)]
*  off the map. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=43.64s)]
*  And I agree with him. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=44.84s)]
*  The bottom line is when you see the inhumanity, you see the devastation, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=45.68s)]
*  you see, frankly, Neil, the evil brought upon the Jewish people in the state of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Israel, you can't not ever look at a baby again and not thank God that that child [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=53.8s)]
*  is healthy when you know in Israel babies were burned. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=59.64s)]
*  They were beheaded. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=64.26s)]
*  It's just devastating. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=66.18s)]
*  And to watch Prime Minister Netanyahu's response by saying in advance to those [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=67.42s)]
*  living in Gaza, leave. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=73.06s)]
*  We are coming in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=75.78s)]
*  There will be a complete siege. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=76.78s)]
*  Having the type of discipline that we've seen from the prime minister to give [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=78.62s)]
*  people a chance to leave is an important indication of the integrity and the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=82.02s)]
*  morality. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=86.74s)]
*  But at the end of the day, Hamas needs to cease to exist. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=87.38s)]
*  And I believe that we should have no daylight between the United States of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  America and Israel and their objective to keep their people safe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=96.1s)]
*  Still, a lot of what you've been saying lately is a lot more sharp and in your [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=103.72s)]
*  face than we've heard from you during this long presidential campaign, Senator. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=108.8s)]
*  You had said just the other day that President Biden has blood on his hands. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=113.96s)]
*  You suggested that the president wasn't even complicit as such in this Hamas [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=119.96s)]
*  assault. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=124.8s)]
*  What did you mean by that? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=125.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, Neil, listen, one of the things I will say is as a guy that believes that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=128.51999999999998s)]
*  commitment to Israel is not just the right thing to do because they're our [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=132.84s)]
*  ally, the right thing to do because they are friends, but that the fact of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=137.4s)]
*  matter is that as a person who believes, want Psalms 122.6 to pray for the peace [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=141.2s)]
*  of Jerusalem and those who do will prosper, I believe that it is our [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=146.48s)]
*  responsibility to have a sharp, strong response to evil when we see it, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  especially when it's brought upon our ally. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=155.79999999999998s)]
*  I would simply say that when you have the weakness of President Biden, you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  invite attacks. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=163.6s)]
*  When you negotiate a deal creating a market for hostages, six billion dollars [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=165.0s)]
*  to Iran, what did Hamas say? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=171.28s)]
*  They said, thank you to Iran. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=173.84s)]
*  That, in my opinion, is being complicit. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=176.52s)]
*  We know, Neil, that money is fungible. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=179.52s)]
*  So when you know that you are funding terrorism by giving six billion dollars to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=182.72s)]
*  Iran, it's just undeniable. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=190.08s)]
*  And it is frustrating to see this president raise the expense, raise the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=191.08s)]
*  bounty on American heads abroad. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=197.4s)]
*  We saw that during the Obama administration. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=201.0s)]
*  I said then the $400 million would only increase the price per American, and now we see [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  six billion dollars. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=209.56s)]
*  But it goes further. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=210.56s)]
*  We know that money will be used to kill Israelis. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=211.56s)]
*  I understand, Senator, but you're also a very cautious and religious man. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=214.16s)]
*  I am. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=218.56s)]
*  I just read from that that you were putting the blame for this and maybe laying the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=219.56s)]
*  siege of this on President Biden. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=226.88s)]
*  I got that. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=228.20000000000002s)]
*  But last time I checked, Hamas butchered those babies. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=229.32s)]
*  Hamas killed better than a thousand innocent Israelis. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=232.8s)]
*  So do you think at this time when the war is on tenderhooks, that's responsible [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=236.28s)]
*  language? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=240.76s)]
*  I do think that without any question it's clear. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=243.28s)]
*  It's clear language and it's forceful language because it is disgusting to see the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=246.0s)]
*  evil brought upon the Jewish people. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=250.67999999999998s)]
*  And Hamas' objective is not just to eliminate Israel, it is to eliminate every [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  Jewish person on the planet and to provide resources to Iran where you know they're [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=258.64s)]
*  the primary supporter of Hamas financially. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  That puts you in a position of being complicit. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  I don't know where there is any guessing on this one. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=274.56s)]
*  This one seems to me to be a straight line. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=278.04s)]
*  While we're commenting on what others have said, I do want you to weigh in on what [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump has said. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, he has since said that he is the only person who could protect Israel and the only [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=285.92s)]
*  person who will. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=291.56s)]
*  But he said prior, and his comments are pretty well known now, that Hezbollah is very smart. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=293.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  He had slammed Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=298.52000000000004s)]
*  He's kind of dialed some of that back, at least on his true social site. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=299.68s)]
*  But I wanted you to weigh in on those comments. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=304.24s)]
*  Well, Neil, I've said it all week when asked, without any question, the former president, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=307.76s)]
*  President Trump, was just dead wrong. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=314.4s)]
*  We should have no daylight between America and Israel. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=316.18s)]
*  We should have no negative comments about Prime Minister Netanyahu as he engaged in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=319.56s)]
*  a war to defend his entire nation and the Jewish people. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=324.84s)]
*  But it goes a step further. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=330.36s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is also fighting for Western democracy. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=332.08s)]
*  The thing that brings it all home is that Hamas' objective includes the elimination [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=336.32s)]
*  of the Jews. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=341.64s)]
*  Six million live in America, but they hate Western democracy for standing on principles, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=342.64s)]
*  for standing on right, for being the fire. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=348.28s)]
*  That's why they call Israel the little Satan and America the big Satan. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=350.76s)]
*  Got it. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=355.44s)]
*  Senator, thank you very much for taking the time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=356.64s)]
*  Senator Tim Scott on all of that. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gxyp8CafnhI&t=358.52s)]
