# ‘IT’S OBVIOUS’: Iran is deeply involved in this, says Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A)
*  with that we bring in Fox News senior strategic analyst General Jack Keene, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=0.0s)]
*  former vice chief of staff of the army and now chairman of the Institute for the Study of War. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=3.68s)]
*  Jack, always good to have you with us. I want to ask you first what's going on militarily right [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=7.92s)]
*  now. We see that Israel is pounding Gaza at this point. The ground invasion has not begun. They [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=12.4s)]
*  have cut off some of the water and food supply and some of this it looks like an effort to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  encourage them to let these hostages go, to put pressure on them to release these hostages. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=24.88s)]
*  Do you think they're going to succeed in that, General? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=30.32s)]
*  I really don't know. I mean they made that statement to Hamas that they turn the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=34.88s)]
*  electricity back on and release you know all the restrictions that they've imposed [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=39.52s)]
*  as soon as they release those hostages and we'll see what develops here. I mean certainly when it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=44.96s)]
*  comes to the hostages themselves I'm confident their special operation forces and ours are [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=50.48s)]
*  looking at you know how can we get them out of there first of all and secondly diplomatic efforts [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=56.4s)]
*  as well and I understand there are some diplomatic discussions that are taking place. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=62.959999999999994s)]
*  Certainly Hamas would want some kind of concessions for those releases. So those efforts [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=68.56s)]
*  are all ongoing but you know when it comes to the hostages [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=74.56s)]
*  I'm a little concerned that the administration hasn't been really unequivocal about what our [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=80.4s)]
*  concern is there. I'll give them credit if they're privately talking to the Iranians [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=85.92s)]
*  and telling them as a matter of fact if you kill one of our hostages and I'd link [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=92.72s)]
*  Iran and Hamas at the hip if you're behind killing one of our hostages you will pay a price for it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=100.4s)]
*  Make no mistake about that. We will come and hurt you if you hurt one of our hostages. They need to [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=108.4s)]
*  understand that this is deterrence not what we do after the fact. We tell them what we intend to do [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  without this specific target in mind in my judgment. I don't know if we've made that clear [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  because the administration has multiple times to connect Iran and what is happening [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=127.92s)]
*  this horrific thing that Hamas has imposed on the Israelis and they refuse to connect it [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=135.28s)]
*  when it's so obvious to everybody looking at this that they are connected. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=140.16s)]
*  Kirby was asked about that just a little while ago and he had another opportunity to [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=146.48s)]
*  draw that distinction and here's what he said. Watch. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=151.6s)]
*  I don't have any updates for you. We're still looking into this but again no [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=154.24s)]
*  direct evidence that Iran was a participant in these attacks in any way. What do you make it up? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=159.28s)]
*  You know to me whether you have a piece of paper or an eavesdrop on a conversation that where Iran [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=167.84s)]
*  was green lining it I don't think that's all a big a deal. I mean the fact is this is their [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=175.36s)]
*  organization and they admitted it. Jake Sullivan said there's broad complicity here that Iran has [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=180.48s)]
*  financed, trained and generally supported this organization on the dark side for years and then [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=187.12s)]
*  he puts a but we have no specific evidence that they're involved in this particular operation. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=194.16s)]
*  The but shouldn't be there he should say and we can assume as a result of 16 years of association [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=200.72s)]
*  with IRGC leaders visiting this organization as a matter of routine throughout those years [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=208.0s)]
*  and helping to train them and support them that obviously our conclusion is Iran is deeply involved [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=213.76s)]
*  in this operation and we're going to hold them accountable as a result of it. How do you think [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=220.64s)]
*  Iran perceives that general? When Iran listens to that answer from John Kirby there we haven't found [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=224.88s)]
*  any link any direct link between this this operation and Iran. How do you think they perceive that? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=232.24s)]
*  Oh they perceive it the same way they have right from the beginning Martha. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=238.8s)]
*  When this administration came into power within 30 days they did two things. One is they reduced the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=243.04s)]
*  Trump maximum sanctions without telling anybody. We know that happened now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=251.44s)]
*  That sent a message to Iran. What they wanted the Iran to get the message that the United States [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=256.64s)]
*  was serious about going back into the nuclear deal and we wanted to ease up on the restrictions [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=263.36s)]
*  that President Trump had imposed on him. Secondly they said we want to get back into negotiations. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=268.32s)]
*  They looked at that as appeasement and weakness and and I think it's all tied together in terms [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=273.84000000000003s)]
*  of what is actually unfolding here and I also believe that what took place in Ukraine by Putin [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=280.8s)]
*  is his perception of U.S. weakness and decline and President Xi in the third regional area [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=288.56s)]
*  he's threatening a war in the third area. We've got two wars going in the other vital interests [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=295.92s)]
*  Europe and the Middle East and but they're all connected. Perception of U.S. weakness and decline [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=300.56s)]
*  is giving our adversaries more aggressive behavior and it seems pretty pretty obvious to me. Now why [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=307.68s)]
*  is the administration foot dancing so much over this issue of not wanting to connect Iran to this [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=314.96s)]
*  specific operation when they're obviously connected to the whole organization for 16 years. It's [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=321.91999999999996s)]
*  because then they're going to be held accountable to do something about it. They don't want to take [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=328.15999999999997s)]
*  action in my judgment is why they're playing footsie with this issue. General Jack Keane thank you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJkJpuGXZ5A&t=333.28s)]
