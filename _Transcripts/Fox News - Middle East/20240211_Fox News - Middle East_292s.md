# Rep. Darrell Issa: Foreign aid is 100% necessary because of Biden's failed foreign policies
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 11, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI)
*  Senate lawmakers debating a $95 billion aid package today that would provide funding for [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=0.0s)]
*  America's foreign allies, including Ukraine's war with Vladimir Putin and Israel's push [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=5.8s)]
*  against Hamas. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=11.02s)]
*  But Republican lawmakers argue it leaves out any money or changes at the southern border. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=12.56s)]
*  A key vote to advance the legislation is expected tomorrow. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=18.16s)]
*  This latest package follows a bipartisan border bill that collapsed in the Senate this week. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=22.42s)]
*  The fallout is testing Republican unity. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=26.78s)]
*  Let's bring in California Congressman Darrell Issa on the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  Committees. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=35.82s)]
*  So Ted Cruz, Senator from Texas, has added H.R.2, the House bill that would reform the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=36.82s)]
*  immigration system at our southern border. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=42.620000000000005s)]
*  He wants that to be part of this aid package. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=45.3s)]
*  What do you think the chances are that this passes the Senate, Congressman? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=48.46s)]
*  Well, the chances of making law without addressing both the foreign policy failures and the domestic [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=52.739999999999995s)]
*  policy failures of this administration are zero. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=60.14s)]
*  The fact is the $95 billion we're being asked in that Senate bill to give in foreign aid [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=63.699999999999996s)]
*  is 100% necessary because of Joe Biden's failed foreign policies. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=68.53999999999999s)]
*  If President Trump had remained in office, Iran would never have, in fact, told its proxies [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=74.34s)]
*  to go ahead and kill 1,000 innocent Israelis. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=79.56s)]
*  Putin would never have come over the border. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=83.52s)]
*  He didn't do it during the entire Trump era. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=85.92s)]
*  He did it when he saw the opportunity with a weak and forgetful president. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=88.68s)]
*  So where do we stand now that the bill that was crafted with so much hoopla and presented [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=93.36s)]
*  in the Senate, that went down in flames, didn't get anywhere close to 60 votes that it needed? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=100.76s)]
*  Where do we stand now? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=106.72s)]
*  Well, we stand right where the president put us, with his failed foreign policy and his [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=109.32s)]
*  failed border policy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=112.96s)]
*  We have 8 million plus people that we didn't invite. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=115.0s)]
*  We'll paraphrase that. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=117.76s)]
*  The president invited them with his policies, and they're here. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=118.92s)]
*  We also have a massive amount of people on the terrorist watch list that are here that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=122.22s)]
*  are going to cost us an awful lot of other money trying to find and get rid of or deal [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=127.24s)]
*  with the fallout of their attacks. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=132.56s)]
*  That's domestic. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=134.68s)]
*  But around the world, these two, this $95 billion proposed in the Senate, that's the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=135.76s)]
*  tip of the iceberg of where we're going to spend money if we don't change policies to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=141.16s)]
*  a policy of real peace through strength instead of pay for your mistakes afterwards with proxies [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  defending against these attacks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=152.28s)]
*  You're on the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=154.84s)]
*  We just heard that report from Mike Tobin about how China is buying Iranian oil, and [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=157.6s)]
*  that's helping to fund Iran's misdeeds in the Middle East. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=163.68s)]
*  Is there anything that the U.S. Congress can do about that? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=168.4s)]
*  Well, the commander in chief has the ability to intercept illegal shipments at sea. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=172.76s)]
*  He hasn't done it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=178.7s)]
*  He has the ability to push back against the assets that are hitting us in the Red Sea. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=179.74s)]
*  He's not doing enough to thwart it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=186.14s)]
*  He's just doing enough with pre-warning to have Iran continue to do it. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=187.76s)]
*  There are two players selling massive amounts of oil to fund their wars. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=193.1s)]
*  It's not just Iran who's doing it to fund the proxy wars. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=198.01999999999998s)]
*  The fact is, Putin is selling also to China massive amounts. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=201.26s)]
*  Putin is selling more oil today under sanctions than he did before the war, and he's doing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=205.38s)]
*  so right under our noses. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=209.92s)]
*  We're watching it, and this president isn't doing anything about it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=211.85999999999999s)]
*  And it's the reason that Putin can resupply his military is that we haven't been effective [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=215.22s)]
*  with these sanctions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=220.7s)]
*  At the end of the day, sanctions on banks are nice, but if they get circumvented, then [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=222.06s)]
*  you have to sanction the actual tangible ships. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=226.73999999999998s)]
*  We have the ability to do it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=229.38s)]
*  They pull over. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=231.14s)]
*  We put them into port, and the oil doesn't arrive in China and the other places, and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=232.29999999999998s)]
*  the loss starts costing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=237.26s)]
*  But until we do that, until we take probably 400 of these pirate ships effectively that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=238.88s)]
*  are carrying the oil, take them off the high seas, this will continue. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=243.54s)]
*  We have the ability to do it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=248.5s)]
*  We've had the ability to do it since Thomas Jefferson. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=249.98s)]
*  There's no better time to make these sanctions work than now if we want to have a peaceful [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=253.06s)]
*  settlement to these two and growing wars. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  California Congressman Darrell Issa, we'll have to leave it there. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=262.86s)]
*  Congressman, thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=266.02s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kq9OTeWWDaI&t=267.02s)]
