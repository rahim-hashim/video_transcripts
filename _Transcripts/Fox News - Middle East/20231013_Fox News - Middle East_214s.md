# US arrests two ‘special interest’ Lebanese men at border: 'CONCERNING'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg)
*  speed Fox News alert and you really need to hear this. CBP tells Fox News that two men from Lebanon were taken into custody just last night. This is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=0.0s)]
*  sparking new national security concerns in the wake of the Hamas attack on Israel. And it comes as encounters with migrants on the terrorism watchlist [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=11.08s)]
*  hits an all time high. Very scary. Griff Jenkins is live in Eagle Pass Texas right now. Griff? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, Ainsley, Brian and Lawrence. And you know, you can't underscore just how concerning our border is. And as we watch the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=25.799999999999997s)]
*  events, horrific events unfold in Israel, there's a reason why nearly 50% of Americans in the latest poll say they consider what's happening at this [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=36.48s)]
*  border and a quote emergency. If we go to the drone, you can see migrants now coming up the bank. But as you rightly point out, Lawrence here [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  exactly where I'm standing in the last 24 hours, CBP took two men in their early twenties from Lebanon into custody. Now they are considered [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=53.12s)]
*  special interest aliens and they are being sent for extensive vetting that will be done by among others, the FBI. And it's worth stepping back [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=63.4s)]
*  for a moment and remembering that DHS was created for the explicit reason of making sure another 9 11 didn't happen. But yet here on our border, we [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=72.64s)]
*  don't know what's coming through in just the past week. Here in this sector, they had more than 10,000 migrant encounters and they report there were [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=83.48s)]
*  1454 known guideways, meaning they observed or saw 1004 and 54 people come across our border and disappear in the night. We don't know who they [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=91.12s)]
*  are, where they're from or why they're here. That is just a snapshot of the week we have here. It comes as we also learned earlier this week, the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=101.16s)]
*  number of special interest aliens coming in the past two years, you've had more than 650 from Iran, more than 500 from Syria, more than 135 from [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  Yemen and from Lebanon, more than 160. This is all a part of the picture. And this is why the border officials here are worried about things as we [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  have been reporting in the last couple of weeks in this Eagle Pass sector, which has been ground zero for this migrant crisis. 90 plus percent of the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=129.08s)]
*  workforce, the Border Patrol Force are processing these migrants. I got up early way before dawn and shot the large group of migrants coming 150 [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=136.84s)]
*  there. Most of those were from Central America, but they're so busy processing, you have more than 60 miles that are totally unpatrolled, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=146.36s)]
*  absolutely wide open. And that is what the cartels are taking advantage of. And to learn that just yesterday we had two middle mid twenties [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=155.04s)]
*  individual males, single males from Lebanon showing up here. That is a very concerning development that we are keeping an eye on. Again, we have no [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=163.96s)]
*  indication that these individuals were here for any wrong purpose other than to simply come and cross. We'll find out once they're vetted. But here's the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=173.24s)]
*  problem. Exactly how deep that vetting goes is a question because we don't know who they are. They could be lying to the officials. Hopefully the FBI and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=181.48s)]
*  the officials can find out more about them and perhaps Lebanon will help us identify them. But it is a concerning snapshot coming on the heels of what we [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  were witnessing unfolding in Israel, guys. Wow. Griff Jenkins, thanks so much. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilme. And I'm Ainsley Earhart. And click [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7v12KZ4_Sg&t=198.88s)]
