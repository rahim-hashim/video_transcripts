# Mike Pompeo: The threat is ‘real’ with Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo)
*  Mideast envoy Steve Witkoff is in Oman today for nuclear talks with Iran's foreign minister. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=0.0s)]
*  This comes as President Trump pushes Tehran to make a deal and quickly on disarming their [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=7.84s)]
*  nuclear program. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=12.620000000000001s)]
*  Will the two sides be able to come to an agreement? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  Let's ask former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=16.94s)]
*  Sir, thank you for joining us here on this Saturday morning. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=19.98s)]
*  Greatly appreciate it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=23.18s)]
*  Let's start with the fact that concerns about how swiftly it's believed that Iran might [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=25.94s)]
*  be able to actually get to a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=32.18s)]
*  The Institute for Science and International Security, they published a new report. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=35.28s)]
*  They're saying in the last year there's been enormous progress made and that the threat [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=38.54s)]
*  posed by Iran's nuclear program has worsened significantly, as they put it. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=44.540000000000006s)]
*  How great is the threat and how swiftly can we act? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=49.46s)]
*  Well, Molly, the threat's real. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=55.02s)]
*  Thanks for having me on this morning to talk about this. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=57.14s)]
*  I think the American people need to understand that the Islamic Republic of Iran is indeed [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=59.14s)]
*  within, goodness, who knows, whether it's weeks or months of having the capability to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=63.540000000000006s)]
*  build out a weapon and ultimately a weapons program. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=69.02000000000001s)]
*  They made enormous advances when the Biden administration simply refused to disarm them [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=72.82000000000001s)]
*  and to put real sanctions in place to deny them the wealth. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=77.94s)]
*  And we saw what resulted, right? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=81.10000000000001s)]
*  Hundreds of Israelis killed by the Iranians and their proxy Hamas, our naval ships fired [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=82.74s)]
*  upon in the Red Sea by the Houthis, another Iranian proxy. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  This is a very serious entity in the Islamic Republic of Iran and for them with a nuclear [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=92.46s)]
*  weapon would be devastatingly risky for the United States of America. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=97.33999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, I think you're raising a great point there about all of the proxies that they're [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=100.94s)]
*  supporting and all of the additional weapons concerns we have about the ballistic missiles [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=105.1s)]
*  and everything that they supply all of these proxies with. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=110.0s)]
*  We don't trust Iran. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=113.2s)]
*  Iran doesn't trust us. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=114.2s)]
*  The president would like to see direct talks. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=115.88s)]
*  Iran keeps doing this, you know, indirect talks and mediators and all of this. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=117.84s)]
*  And now we have these big meetings going on in the Middle East, broadly speaking, and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=123.28s)]
*  will likely continue. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=129.24s)]
*  But they have a foreign minister, Abbas Arachi, who wrote in the Washington Post this week, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=130.24s)]
*  he says, a significant wall of mistrust is how he describes it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=134.96s)]
*  How do we make progress? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=139.28s)]
*  Is this about building trust or is this about stalling on the part of Iran? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=140.82000000000002s)]
*  Molly, I'm near certain it's about stalling for the Iranians, but I don't think President [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=146.36s)]
*  Trump will let them get away with that. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=152.4s)]
*  You'll recall there was a nuclear deal before when I became secretary of state within a [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=154.72s)]
*  couple of weeks. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=158.4s)]
*  The United States withdrew from that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=159.4s)]
*  It was called the JCPOA. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=160.84s)]
*  It was useless because, frankly, it allowed Iran to continue to build its ballistic missiles [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=162.68s)]
*  and do all kinds of things and then, frankly, just couldn't verify that the Iranians were [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=167.52s)]
*  really doing what they promised they would do. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=171.52s)]
*  So they cheated constantly. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=173.24s)]
*  We can't go down that path again. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't think President Trump will allow Mr. Wyckoff to do that either. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=176.96s)]
*  We have to fully, verifiably eliminate their nuclear weapons program for there to be any [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=181.16s)]
*  agreement. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=186.8s)]
*  And I see no evidence that the Iranians have any intention of doing that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=187.8s)]
*  And I see no intention that they are willing to stop behaving badly all across the world. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=191.2s)]
*  All we ask is that they behave like a normal nation, and there is no indication they're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  prepared to do that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=201.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  Switching gears just slightly. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  This isn't too much of a switch in gears, but to the war in Ukraine, Envoy Steve Wyckoff, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=204.35999999999999s)]
*  he is also meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=208.6s)]
*  So there are a lot of different talks going on, but do you think the U.S. will be able [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=213.2s)]
*  to help those two countries also reach a peace deal? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  Have we gotten any closer? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, I'm actually more optimistic there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=222.23999999999998s)]
*  I think that that's been going on for three years. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  I think both sides have lots of risk facing them. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  We need to continue to make sure that the Europeans do their part to support the Ukrainians [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=231.88s)]
*  so Putin can't make any more progress. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=236.64s)]
*  Then he can see he's not going to roll through Kiev and gain the political outcome that he [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=238.16s)]
*  wanted to get when he started back in February of 2022, when the United States fundamentally [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=242.72s)]
*  lost deterrence. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=247.7s)]
*  I think he's beginning to see that, that President Trump's not going to give him what it is he [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=249.44s)]
*  really wants, which is to be able to advance through Europe. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=254.0s)]
*  When he sees that, he'll see that the costs exceed the benefits. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=256.6s)]
*  I hope, I don't know if it's next week or next month, but before too long, he'll conclude [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=260.24s)]
*  that it's in his best interest to stop, to take his arms back from that border and to [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=264.44s)]
*  find a resolution that stops killing Russian soldiers and Ukrainian kids. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=270.56s)]
*  Great point. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=276.92s)]
*  We would all love to see peace in that region. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=277.92s)]
*  I guess it's not without worth pointing out that Iran is also among the parties supplying [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=278.92s)]
*  Russia with some of their weapons, drones, et cetera. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=283.44s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=286.56s)]
*  These are all connected, Molly. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=287.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=289.56s)]
*  And so thank you for kind of pulling things together and offering us all of your insights. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=290.56s)]
*  We greatly appreciate it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vkvrfJ1H6Wo&t=294.48s)]
