# Trump issues ominous evacuation warning to Tehran as he leaves G7 summit abruptly
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw)
*  We begin this morning with a Fox News alert. In just a few minutes President Trump is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=0.0s)]
*  expected to land back in Washington, D.C. after leaving the G7 summit a day early. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=6.2s)]
*  The president meeting with the National Security Council and the White House is [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=12.32s)]
*  reportedly planning talks with Iran this week. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=15.96s)]
*  Right now nearly one million people rushing to bomb shelters in Tel Aviv as more than [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  300,000 people are being warned to evacuate Tehran. You're watching Fox [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=24.32s)]
*  of France First here on a very busy Tuesday morning. I'm Todd Pyrone. And I'm [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=30.0s)]
*  Carly Schimkes. We turn it over to Mike Tobin who is live on the ground in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=33.72s)]
*  Tel Aviv with the very latest. Hi Mike. Good morning Carly. The ballistic missile [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=37.32s)]
*  attacks directed in the area of central Israel and northern Israel continue but [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=43.44s)]
*  after several false alarms last night a missile attack materialized but instead [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=48.24s)]
*  of hundreds of missiles and drones there were tens of missiles and drones. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=52.48s)]
*  There were some that got through. We've got seen some four impacts in [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=56.12s)]
*  Herzliya which is just north of Tel Aviv. One struck a parking lot where a [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=59.76s)]
*  bus was set on fire. We've also got reports that a residence was hit. No one [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=63.559999999999995s)]
*  was home at the time and no one was injured. It all happens as President [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  Trump abruptly left the G7 summit in Canada and posted an ominous message to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=71.8s)]
*  his truth social concluding with the line everyone should immediately [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  evacuate Tehran. Israeli warplanes continue to aggressively target Iran [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=80.96s)]
*  this morning. The IDF claims to have killed Ali Shadmani Iran's newly [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=86.12s)]
*  appointed wartime chief of staff. He was the most senior military commander [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=89.92s)]
*  closest to the Grand Ayatollah Ali Khamenei but he only had the job for four [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=93.8s)]
*  days. He was appointed after his predecessor was killed in the early [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  stages of what Israel is now calling or has been calling Operation Rising Lion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=101.52s)]
*  We know through our Pentagon team that the US is moving mid-air refueling [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=107.63999999999999s)]
*  tankers to Europe to possibly assist in the efforts here in the Middle East. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  Also the USS Nimitz carrier strike group has been moved to the Middle East [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=116.44s)]
*  ahead of schedule. All of this as President Trump posted to truth social [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=121.24s)]
*  that he's not leaving the G7 to work on a ceasefire. It's much bigger than [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=126.39999999999999s)]
*  that, he wrote. Carly? Yeah Mike, you know two things happened last night [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=131.04s)]
*  within the hour of each other. The first was that the president announced that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=135.96s)]
*  he is going to be leaving the G7 summit a day early and if that wasn't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  surprising enough he also posted on truth social warning all civilians to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  leave Tehran. So the indication would be that something major is happening. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  As we asked this question I believe that we're seeing the plane that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  president is on as we said that he did leave that G7 summit in Canada. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=155.68s)]
*  Yeah and it's just touching down back down at Joint Base Andrews. So as he [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  gets set to to de-board that plane I'm going to continue my question with you [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=165.6s)]
*  and it would indicate by that truth social post and the fact that he left [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=170.88s)]
*  the summit early that something that Israel is planning something big. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=175.24s)]
*  Is that the sense that you're getting when it comes to all of this? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=179.72s)]
*  That is a sense is getting it and you get some of the sense that the US may [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=184.12s)]
*  somehow be involved from the president's words and that leads to a lot of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=188.08s)]
*  speculation. We know to this point the US has assisted with missile interception [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=191.76s)]
*  and that is the real missile interception and providing weapons to [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=197.32s)]
*  Israel to this point and that has been the limit of US involvement in this [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=202.12s)]
*  particular context but there was a lot of speculation now that you may see [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=206.92s)]
*  more US involvement. One thing that Israel would like from the US is [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=211.92s)]
*  assistance in terms of bunker busting weapons. Only the B-2 bomber can carry [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=216.2s)]
*  this large bunker buster that the US does indeed possess and that could quite [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=221.32s)]
*  possibly allow penetration of the nuclear facility at Fordo. A lot of that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=227.48s)]
*  of course is speculation but you're certainly getting some hints out of the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=232.48s)]
*  president. And Mike you also mentioned that Israel was anticipating hundreds [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=235.44s)]
*  of missiles incoming last night and tens actually arrived. Does that indicate [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=240.04s)]
*  that Iran and their missile supply is significantly depleted just five days [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=245.48s)]
*  into this current conflict? I think it's more of an indication that Iran is now [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=250.88s)]
*  in disarray. You have seen the assassination of a lot of their top [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=256.48s)]
*  military commanders and these are the guys who would have been planning their [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=260.32s)]
*  counter strikes at Israel. So there isn't really anyone to make decisions and you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=263.64s)]
*  also have Israel announcing that they have destroyed one-third of the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=268.56s)]
*  ballistic missile launchers. So Iran has some problems in terms of organization [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=272.52s)]
*  right now. Also they may be very careful in terms of deploying their missile [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=277.4s)]
*  launchers because when they deploy them they lose them. Carly. Mike Tobin live [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=280.72s)]
*  for us in Tel Aviv this morning. Mike thank you and on your screen right now [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=284.72s)]
*  you are looking as a President Trump's plane Air Force One of course arrives at [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=287.6s)]
*  Joint Base Andrews. We are awaiting the president leaving that plane and heading [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=293.12s)]
*  to the White House but first let's bring in national security and military [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=298.12s)]
*  analysts and international relations expert Dr. Rebecca Grant. Dr. Grant I [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=301.6s)]
*  want to go to the Truth Social Post that everybody's talking about this morning. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=305.84000000000003s)]
*  Mike Tobin alluded to it. It says the following publicity seeking President [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=309.4s)]
*  Emmanuel Macron of France mistakenly said that I left the G7 summit in Canada [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=313.32s)]
*  to go back to DC to work on a ceasefire between Israel and Iran. Wrong. He has no [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=317.91999999999996s)]
*  idea why I am now on my way to Washington but it certainly has nothing [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  to do with a ceasefire much bigger than that. Dr. Grant what is much bigger than [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=328.44s)]
*  that? What could that mean and why did he say it has nothing to do with a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=334.12s)]
*  ceasefire? President Trump has come back early to be in place as commander in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=337.64s)]
*  chief because he has some evaluations and decisions to make. I think he will be [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=343.88s)]
*  looking at a number of options and the deployment of aerial refueling tankers [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=349.03999999999996s)]
*  forward to Europe. That's an air bridge that can create the basis for intensified [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=354.08s)]
*  air strikes even long-range bomber strikes. So clearly Trump has a lot of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=359.4s)]
*  evaluations to go through possibly assisting Israel with the denuclearization [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=363.64s)]
*  of Iran. Yeah and could he mean by something bigger than a ceasefire? Could [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=369.15999999999997s)]
*  he be alluding to the fact that a potential nuclear deal would be on the [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=373.2s)]
*  horizon? It does feel like it is a big day as the president touches down there [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=376.68s)]
*  in Washington DC and in just four days Israel really has Dr. Grant accomplished [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=380.68s)]
*  a lot. Is Iran at a point where they would sign on to giving up nuclear [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=385.08s)]
*  weapons to potentially avoid regime change? I think Iran's president has [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=390.52s)]
*  signaled all along that he believes talks are important and President Trump [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=397.91999999999996s)]
*  has left the door open for talks. We know it's been the Ayatollah Khamenei and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=402.96s)]
*  others in those theological thugs in that regime who haven't wanted to do it. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=407.0s)]
*  And hard to say where Iran's leadership what's left of it is at this point but [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=411.56s)]
*  there's no question Trump will leave that door open for a deal but Iran's [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=418.16s)]
*  gonna have to show they're sincere if they want to talk how to do that stop [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  those missile attacks. As we look on the right hand side of your screen they're [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=425.52s)]
*  bringing in the stairs so that President Trump and everybody there on Air Force [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=428.6s)]
*  one can disembark the plane. But I want to follow up on what Carly just said. The [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=432.96s)]
*  question remains to me Dr. Grant how can we even trust that Iran will honor any [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=437.64s)]
*  in my estimation if the current regime remains in place and yes that leads to [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=444.08s)]
*  that question of regime change. Well two things one clearly Trump is keeping the [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=449.76s)]
*  military pressure on deploying a second aircraft carrier gives him all the [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=456.4s)]
*  sovereign strike options. Iran's got to know that but remember now Todd because [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=461.47999999999996s)]
*  of what's happened we have a lot more surveillance and insight into exactly [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=466.64s)]
*  what's going on in Iran. One thing Israel's learned from this campaign is [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=471.28s)]
*  exactly the state of that target base what their military is really up to and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=475.2s)]
*  President Trump too will see whether Iran's military is postured to keep [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=479.64s)]
*  going or begging to get this over with. So we have a lot more sense now and of [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=484.0s)]
*  course the destruction that Israel has achieved on that target set will make [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=489.15999999999997s)]
*  the the basis for a nuclear deal if we get one I think quite a bit stronger and [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=494.32s)]
*  I'm so glad to see a lot of their air defenses and missile capability [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=499.08s)]
*  eliminated. Yeah do you think that US involvement in this and I mean not in a [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=502.47999999999996s)]
*  defensive posture but actual involvement do you think that's where we're headed? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=506.56s)]
*  Certainly that is the overture that is being made with the tankers the aircraft [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=512.92s)]
*  carrier the aircraft carrier and the tankers that's a message that the US is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=518.4399999999999s)]
*  ready to get more involved don't underrate the defensive posture that [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=523.04s)]
*  we're in. Space Force is watching every one of those Iranian missile launches [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=528.12s)]
*  we've seen the Navy up intercepting and you can bet Navy and US land-based [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=532.2s)]
*  aircraft on patrol in that region as well. We're already pretty involved and [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=536.6s)]
*  Trump is pointing out to Iran and others that there could be more to come from the [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=540.5600000000001s)]

*  it is quote-unquote possible the US could get involved in the conflict. What's [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=574.6s)]
*  your read on those two points Dr. Grant? That tells me that General Cain, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=581.16s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and others have given Trump a full suite [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=587.36s)]

*  not actually made that decision among those options yet and that's why he's [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=604.8s)]
*  going to want to be able to be back in the Situation Room where he can talk to [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=610.16s)]
*  CENTCOM, the other commanders and his cabinet, Secretary Hegsteth, General Cain [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=613.4399999999999s)]

*  there is also reporting Dr. Grant that President Trump and the White House [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=625.7199999999999s)]
*  could be in talks with Iran to continue with nuclear discussions at some point [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=631.0799999999999s)]
*  this week and given the number of senior military leaders that Iran has already [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=635.6s)]
*  lost due to these Israeli airstrikes and the number of damage that these nuclear [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=641.08s)]
*  sites and missile sites have already taken you can imagine that when it comes [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=645.84s)]
*  to the posture and who has the leverage I mean these talks could significantly [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=650.8000000000001s)]
*  change between the last round two weeks ago and the one that could take place [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=656.8800000000001s)]
*  this week. Oh yes the situation for the talks has changed enormously and Iran's [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=660.72s)]
*  typical pattern having done some strikes now more than a dozen barrages against [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=667.6s)]
*  Israel would kind of be to stand down and you know who knows what they'll [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=672.32s)]
*  really do but at this point the leverage rests with with Israel and and also with [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=677.12s)]
*  the US and this is what Trump's gonna want to evaluate it. I'm sure there is [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=682.6s)]
*  also some back-channel diplomacy going on either with other allies and partners [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=686.76s)]
*  in the region or other nations so they're gonna be diplomatic inputs [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=692.28s)]

*  be shuffling through with his senior advisors as he decides what the next [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=704.4s)]
*  course of action is we know he does not want a wider war the number one goal [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=708.6s)]
*  here is to contain Iran but this is just shown us why Iran cannot have nuclear [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=712.26s)]
*  weapons imagine the force protection that we need if you had a couple of [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hhc0WaVNhrw&t=718.5s)]
