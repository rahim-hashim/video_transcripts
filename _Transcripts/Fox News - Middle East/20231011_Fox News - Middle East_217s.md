# Iran's thumbprint is all over this: Rep. Rich McCormick
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE)
*  Let's bring in Georgia Congressman Rich McCormick, who serves on the House Armed Services Committee [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=0.0s)]
*  and is also a former Marine pilot and emergency physician. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=4.04s)]
*  So we could talk to you about a lot of different things, Congressman, and we thank you for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=7.84s)]
*  joining us this morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=11.28s)]
*  I do want to start with why this attack is happening right now. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  And the Biden administration held an all senators briefing yesterday on this, and Fox News obtained [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=15.64s)]
*  a readout of it. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=21.8s)]
*  And Acting Deputy Secretary of State Victoria Nuland said that one of the reasons this attack [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=23.400000000000002s)]
*  took place now is because of Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=28.24s)]
*  And they believe that Hamas successfully sabotaged that negotiation, saying it appears all progress [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=30.92s)]
*  has been lost as the Crown Prince has made comments in support of Palestine. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=36.44s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=40.84s)]
*  You know, it's a really sad thing to hear. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=41.84s)]
*  You can see Iran's thumbprint all over this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=45.120000000000005s)]
*  I hate to hear that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=48.64s)]
*  I've done operations in and around Saudi Arabia when I was in the military. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=49.96s)]
*  To see that sort of relationship develop is going to absolutely undermine the Abraham's [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=54.76s)]
*  accord. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=59.76s)]
*  And I hate to see that. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  Meantime, speaking of Iran, 20 GOP senators calling on Joe Biden to refreeze the $6 billion [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=69.6s)]
*  Senator Marshall Blackburn wrote a letter that reads as follows. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=70.6s)]
*  Your administration claims these funds are only available for humanitarian use, but money [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=73.2s)]
*  is fungible and there is significant risk could be used to further efforts by Iran or [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=78.0s)]
*  Hamas against Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=83.86s)]
*  Congressman, is this supported by the House? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=85.58s)]
*  And do you individually support this? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=88.46s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=91.22s)]
*  I think it will be almost universally supported by the House. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=92.22s)]
*  I do support it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=95.89999999999999s)]
*  And I think additionally, we need to have additional sanctions also. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=96.89999999999999s)]
*  I think as much as possible, this government needs to be squeezed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=100.06s)]
*  It's obviously being used as a proxy by Iran. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=103.33999999999999s)]
*  This needs to be taken on every single way you can, militarily, strategically, economically. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=107.61999999999999s)]
*  This government needs to be punished wherever it is misstepped. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  Well, of course, no funding can get passed unless the House has a House speaker and that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=115.5s)]
*  vote happens today. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=119.94s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=120.94s)]
*  I think we had some really good progress last night in closed session. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=123.54s)]
*  I think also maybe there's a bit of a misconception since this is new ground that's never been [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=126.62s)]
*  done before. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=130.74s)]
*  We think that the Speaker Pro Temp can be used appropriately. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=132.66s)]
*  There's obviously emergency powers the president can use too that make these monies available [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=136.46s)]
*  Assuming for argument's sake, the Speaker Pro Temp does not have those capabilities. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=142.73999999999998s)]
*  And ultimately, you do need a speaker. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=148.1s)]
*  Who's it looking like that speaker will be? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=150.85999999999999s)]
*  Scalise Jordan or one Kevin McCarthy? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=153.1s)]
*  So Kevin McCarthy was very humble, very gracious last night, asked no members to nominate him, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=158.45999999999998s)]
*  did not want to be voted for. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=165.14s)]
*  We're going to solve most of this behind closed doors, which is a good thing. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=167.06s)]
*  I think most of us have no stomach for getting in front of the public without somebody already [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=170.62s)]
*  decided as a conference before we go into public. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  Who are you supporting and will we have a House speaker by tomorrow? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=179.62s)]
*  I'm supporting Jim Jordan. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  That's a recent decision. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=184.78s)]
*  You're actually the first people to know this. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=185.78s)]
*  They don't even know that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=188.02s)]
*  Just listening to the debate, I thought he made a stronger case. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=189.82000000000002s)]
*  Actually, even the things that I disagree on, at least there's a strong case for leadership. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=193.5s)]
*  I think they'd both be amazing, though. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=198.10000000000002s)]
*  I think they both have great relationships and can help us along to get to where we need to go. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=199.78s)]
*  They are both certainly popular in the Republican caucus. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=205.18s)]
*  It would be the number one story if obviously a situation in Israel was not happening. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=207.5s)]
*  We'll be paying attention to Washington, D.C. today. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=211.74s)]
*  Congressman Dr. Rich McCormick, thank you so much. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=54YeD03PrRE&t=214.14s)]
