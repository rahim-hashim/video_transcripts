# White House says Biden will veto House GOP Israel aid package
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw)
*  White House saying President Biden will veto the House GOP's Israel package because it [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=0.0s)]
*  doesn't include funding for Ukraine, Taiwan and the border. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  The veto threat coming after anti-war activists pushing for a ceasefire disrupted that Senate [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=8.52s)]
*  hearing yesterday saying the Biden administration has blood on its hands. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Jackie Heinrich is live on the North Lawn on this first day of November with the latest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=18.0s)]
*  Jackie. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=21.88s)]
*  Good morning to you guys. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=22.88s)]
*  Yeah, it was a very lengthy statement explaining the president's rationale on this, but they [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=23.88s)]
*  They accuse the House GOP of basically inserting partisanship into this aid package for Israel [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=28.68s)]
*  and alienating support for the people of Gaza, humanitarian support, and also Ukraine and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=35.72s)]
*  our partners in the Indo-Pacific. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=42.68s)]
*  There's a very long statement from the Office of Management and Budget last night, and it [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=44.52s)]
*  reads, this bill threatens the security and stability of our partners in the region. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=47.36s)]
*  A deepening crisis will undermine the possibility of Israel's further integration into the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=52.08s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=56.160000000000004s)]
*  If the president were presented with this bill, he would veto it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  But another significant issue is that this breaks from precedent by seeking funding cuts [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=60.72s)]
*  as part of an emergency national security package. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=65.36s)]
*  The proposal would cut IRS funding from the Inflation Reduction Act in order to seek its [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=68.6s)]
*  passage. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=73.8s)]
*  That would likely never get through the Democrat-controlled Senate, and Republicans also in the upper [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  chamber like Senator Mitch McConnell have expressed a desire as well to pass these priorities [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=79.32s)]
*  together. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=84.28s)]
*  The White House has also announced that the aid package the White House seeks also wants [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=85.4s)]
*  to rebuild U.S. military capabilities. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=88.92s)]
*  Meantime, a hearing on Capitol Hill yesterday on the funding request was interrupted by [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=91.92s)]
*  anti-Israel protesters. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=96.76s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hJ_RbOyz_Aw&t=98.76s)]
