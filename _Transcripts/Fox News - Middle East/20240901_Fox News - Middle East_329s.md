# 'SHEER EVIL': Ex-Israeli official shreds calls for ceasefire
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert this morning heartbreak and outrage as America's best ally in the Middle East Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=0.0s)]
*  Confirms the murder of six hostages including one American [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=7.46s)]
*  Former Israeli ambassador at Galat Erdan was in office when Hamas terrorists kidnapped the hostages last October. He joins us now from Israel [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=12.6s)]
*  God, thanks for being here. You know this this this detail important detail that Hamas [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=20.32s)]
*  Executed these hostages before they could be found does that change the dynamic of how the Israeli government thinks about [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=26.76s)]
*  Continuing to try to crush Hamas and get and the way in which they would attempt to get these hostages back [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=35.2s)]
*  It doesn't change on the contrary it only [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=41.52s)]
*  Strengthens our commitment to continue until we eradicate Hamas [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=44.879999999999995s)]
*  Totally and I think that when this war started when Hamas committed the atrocities on October 7th [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=50.8s)]
*  There was a consensus everyone understood it even President Biden said that we are [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=58.04s)]
*  Fighting sheer evil and Hamas needs to be eliminated totally but since then [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=63.28s)]
*  Sadly the international community including the administration [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=69.44s)]
*  Applied more and more pressure on Israel to agree to a ceasefire and Pete now that we've seen [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=73.96s)]
*  How they executing cold blood our [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=82.24s)]
*  Civilians and there's a feeling of palpable sadness here in Israel everywhere [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  So we should all understand this war shouldn't end this we should win this war [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=91.3s)]
*  We shouldn't end this war [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=98.08s)]
*  Ending this war now meaning that we allow Hamas to survive after the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=100.28s)]
*  atrocities that they committed and they'll be able to commit them again and again and it will inspire Iran and all [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=106.32s)]
*  Its terrorist proxies in our region to continue with their crazy dream to annihilate Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  So this is the time for the international community for the administration in America to understand that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  No more pressure should apply on Israel [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=126.12s)]
*  We should encourage the Israeli government to continue to increase the pressure on Hamas [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=129.67999999999998s)]
*  Until we hunt them down [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=136.39999999999998s)]
*  You mentioned that pressure from the outside from the Biden administration. Well [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=139.11999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris is part of it it back when she used to do interviews before she was the nominee [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  Made the nominee in March of this year [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  She talked about the offensive in Rafa that the very place where we're talking about right now [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=151.44s)]
*  And we want to remind our audience of what Kamala Harris said in March watch [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=156.76s)]
*  We have been [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  clear in multiple conversations and in every way that any [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=164.96s)]
*  major [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  Military operation in Rafa would be a huge mistake. Let me tell you something. I have studied the maps [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=172.24s)]
*  there's nowhere for those folks to go and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=179.8s)]
*  We're looking at about a million and a half people in Rafa who are there because they were told to go there most of them [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=182.35999999999999s)]
*  and so we've been very clear that [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  It would be a mistake to move into Rafa with any type of military operation [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=191.16s)]
*  So what do you say to Kamala Harris who says that moving into Rafa is a huge mistake? I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=196.44s)]
*  Think that applying pressure on Israel not to enter Rafa was a mistake because [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=202.2s)]
*  Hamas is exactly like ISIS like al-qaeda when America was chasing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=208.39999999999998s)]
*  Al-Qaeda or ISIS nobody said nobody told [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=215.76s)]
*  America don't enter Mosul or don't go after the terrorists wherever they are [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=220.88s)]
*  We have to be united when we fight against sheer evil and for Hamas [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=226.32s)]
*  Rafa is an important stronghold [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=233.76s)]
*  That's their lifeline as was explained here earlier [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=236.76s)]
*  Hamas dug dig many many tunnels there. They smuggled their weapons from Egypt [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=241.28s)]
*  They hide the sadly our hostages in in those tunnels [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=247.84s)]
*  So we had to go into Rafa all the you know, the prophecies about what would happen if we enter [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=252.2s)]
*  Rafa was were a mistake. I know we saw that there were no [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=259.8s)]
*  Civilian casualties in Rafa the terrorists continue to hide there [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=264.84s)]
*  So again, it was a mistake to apply pressure on Israel and from now on after we've seen how they executed our [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=269.0s)]
*  civilians including an American [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=276.8s)]
*  Hostage we should all be united in supporting Israel to chase and hunt down these evil terrorists cruel terrorists [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=279.4s)]
*  Yeah, I've said it from day one. I hope Israel kills every last member of Hamas [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=287.84s)]
*  And in doing so gets every hostage back [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=294.12s)]
*  Each and every one of them and we should remember a ceasefire is a word that sounds positive [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=297.59999999999997s)]
*  But a ceasefire means that Hamas can [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=303.2s)]
*  Survive and get a free pass after what they have done and that will be a terrible mistake [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  a ceasefire only if we should if we maintain the possibility to eradicate Hamas and its leadership [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=312.79999999999995s)]
*  There you go, Gilad Erdan. Thank you for your time this morning [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=320.68s)]
*  Good to see you. Thank you. Thanks for having a tough day in Israel [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IIZ2nCFnjDI&t=324.08s)]
