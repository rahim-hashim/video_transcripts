# This is a diabolical regime: Retired Army Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI)
*  Welcome back, America. Nobody better than retired four-star general Jack Keane, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=0.0s)]
*  Army general. Four stars are hard to get. I just want people to know it's an amazing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  accomplishment. He's a great patriot. General, I want to read some headlines to you here that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  are recent, the last few days. Here's one headline. Iran orders thousands of tons of ballistic missile [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=20.72s)]
*  ingredients for China, up to 800 missiles that that does can provide for. That's the Jerusalem [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=26.24s)]
*  Post. AP, Iran has amassed even more near weapons grade uranium, UN watchdog says, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=32.08s)]
*  more than they thought. And they've been hyper generating it since they've been negotiating with [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=37.68s)]
*  our administration. CNN, Iran's supreme leader slams US nuclear proposal, says it will continue [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=42.0s)]
*  to enrich uranium. And then Iran counter US nuclear offer as Trump sends new warning. General, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=48.16s)]
*  this is a terrorist regime that has helped ban on getting nuclear weapons. Am I right about that? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  No, absolutely. And the motivation is very clear. They believe just downright that if Saddam Hussein [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  had a nuclear weapon, he never would have been removed. If Gaddafi did not give up his nuclear [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=69.44s)]
*  weapons, he never would have been removed. It's about the preservation of the regime, one, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=75.68s)]
*  and number two, as leverage to threaten Israel, and if necessary, destroy the state of Israel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=82.24000000000001s)]
*  And we've got to be clear right about that. Americans who roll their eyes at something like [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  that and say, oh, they can't be serious. Believe me, they are serious. And the Arabs know it as [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=93.12s)]
*  well. And if they get a nuclear weapon, we are in then a nuclear arms race. And the Arabs will get [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=99.04s)]
*  those weapons as quickly as possible. And my friend Henry Kissinger warned me and he said, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=107.04s)]
*  Jack, the greatest danger I think facing the United States from World War II to the present [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=112.0s)]
*  is a nuclear arms race in the Middle East, which would likely lead his words to a nuclear exchange. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=118.80000000000001s)]
*  He said, we can never ever let this happen. So that's where we are. And we've got to put [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  our foot down here. This is why I think all the wording is wrong. It's so much propaganda. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=131.04s)]
*  The warmongers, so the people who want to stop a terrorist Islamist regime that threatens the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=138.16s)]
*  United States and Israel and quite frankly threatens the free world from getting a nuclear [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=144.48s)]
*  warhead and obviously they're building these missiles as fast as they can with the help of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  the communist Chinese now, that somehow we're the warmongers. We're the peacemongers. You know, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=154.23999999999998s)]
*  you're a four star general or where you saw war up close. You're saying we cannot allow the [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=160.16s)]
*  Iranians to get nuclear weapons as a man who has been to war, who has seen war, who has led troops. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=165.84s)]
*  What am I missing here? Yeah, absolutely. Those of us who do not want Iran to have a nuclear weapon, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=174.8s)]
*  we're not advocating war. We're trying to stop a Holocaust from taking place as a result of [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=182.24s)]
*  something like this. And that's the reality of what we're facing. This is a diabolical regime. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=187.12s)]
*  The fact that we refer to them as clerics and mullahs is a joke. This is an Islamic [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  theocracy that's an oppressive and repressive regime and they want to dominate and control [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=200.8s)]
*  the Middle East and the flow of oil. And as they have said many, many times over and over in their [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=205.76s)]
*  45 years of existence, destroy the state of Israel. They are about this and this is serious [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=212.4s)]
*  business. It's and is extremely dangerous and we have to take the appropriate action [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=219.52s)]
*  to prevent it from happening. And let me just say something about these ballistic missiles. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=225.44s)]
*  The Israelis are very concerned about these ballistic missiles. Just use conventionally. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  Why is that? Iran attacked them in that first attack in April, over 300 things flying at them, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=235.84s)]
*  drones and missiles. 105 of those were ballistic missiles. Only four penetrated their defense [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=241.84s)]
*  systems. Then October came after the Israelis had attacked Iran again in retaliation and Iran attacked [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=248.56s)]
*  this time only with ballistic missiles. 200 of them came at Israel and a stunning number of 40 [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=256.64s)]
*  penetrated the system. Iran was only attacking military targets. They had 11 minutes of warning [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=266.16s)]
*  all the airplanes took off from the airfields. The people got in their bunkers and they also attacked [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=272.08s)]
*  the Mossad headquarters, no damage done. Think about what is happening here and you introduced it. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=277.52s)]
*  The capability to have hundreds of ballistic missiles with China's help flying at Israel, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=284.32s)]
*  not 200, 400, 600 ballistic missiles to overwhelm the air defense systems. Not flying at military [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=291.44s)]
*  targets, but coming at Tel Aviv and Jerusalem with the impact on civilian casualties. This [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=298.96s)]
*  is something the Israelis fear and they have got to get this shut down. That is why they are working [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=305.12s)]
*  with the Trump administration. Hopefully diplomacy works. But if it does not work, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=311.91999999999996s)]
*  we must take down their nuclear enterprise and we must take down their ballistic missile enterprise [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=317.2s)]
*  as well. These are essential things. If we can get it worked out diplomatically, fine. If not, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=323.12s)]
*  we cannot let them stay on this path. When we come back, I would love to know how we can get [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=328.64s)]
*  this worked out diplomatically. We are dealing with a country that has lied and cheated on [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=333.59999999999997s)]
*  everything they have signed, whether it is Obama, whether it is Biden, whatever it is, they just [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=337.91999999999996s)]
*  keep moving on. I want to pursue this with you when we return. We will be right back. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gX0TMtdj_jI&t=343.2s)]
