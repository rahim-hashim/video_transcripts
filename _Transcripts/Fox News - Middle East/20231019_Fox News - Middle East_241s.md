# Biden's Israeli ambassador nominee grilled over Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA)
*  As war rages in Israel, President Biden's nominee for U.S. ambassador to that country, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=0.0s)]
*  I know, was taken so long, facing a battle of his own in the Senate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=5.32s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=9.28s)]
*  In his secretary of treasury in the Obama administration, he helped negotiate the disastrous [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=10.28s)]
*  Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=15.96s)]
*  The massive influx of cash, ultimately a direct deposit into Iran's terrorism account. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=17.64s)]
*  Yes or no? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=23.6s)]
*  Are we safer today with no arms embargo? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=24.6s)]
*  I think it's a bunch more complicated than that. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=27.44s)]
*  I'm not aware that funding for Hamas and Hezbollah went down. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=29.48s)]
*  You know, I will get briefed on that. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=32.88s)]
*  I think you're aware of the results of it, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=35.28s)]
*  The maximum pressure campaign was abandoned. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=38.32s)]
*  And now a policy of appeasement has been undertaken with Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=41.4s)]
*  GOP Senator Bill Haggerty just saw, you just saw that in him in the hearing. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=45.28s)]
*  Senator, your reaction to Jack Lew's nomination, to make it simple, he, going behind your back, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  did not tell the truth to the Senate when he was actually working as treasury secretary [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=58.56s)]
*  about how he was converting to currency, the Oman currency, to euros. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=64.48s)]
*  He was out there working behind the scenes to get Iran money without telling you guys. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=71.48s)]
*  This is the world's greatest sponsor of terror. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  And he couldn't answer my questions, Brian, when I asked him if Iran, the world's greatest [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=81.76s)]
*  sponsor of terror, has more funding, do you think that will lead to more terror? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=86.2s)]
*  He obfuscated, couldn't answer the question. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=89.84s)]
*  We know the answer to the question. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=92.28s)]
*  And I'll tell you this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=93.28s)]
*  We know what happened when we choked those funds off. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=94.44s)]
*  I worked in the Trump administration as we implemented the maximum pressure campaign. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  You saw us push Iranian funding down below $8 billion. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=100.68s)]
*  We totally choked this off. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=104.12s)]
*  Back during Obama, during the appeasement campaign in 2014, 2015, you saw the violence [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=105.86s)]
*  coming out of Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=109.82000000000001s)]
*  Biden comes back into office, looks the other way, you get this hockey stick of revenues [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=111.28s)]
*  coming into Iran. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=114.96s)]
*  As soon as they start getting funding again, guess what happens? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=115.96s)]
*  The 11-day war in Gaza in 2021. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=118.88s)]
*  And now you've seen this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=121.24s)]
*  Hamas and Hezbollah were going broke. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=122.39999999999999s)]
*  It was widely reported in the media under President Trump's maximum pressure campaign. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=124.36s)]
*  Now we've got Biden's appeasement program. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=128.48s)]
*  They're back in business. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=130.82s)]
*  But Senator, if we know what he was up to, the Israelis know what he's up to. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=131.82s)]
*  They need to trust our ambassador. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  They're not going to be able to trust this guy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=139.66s)]
*  Here's the other problem. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=141.92s)]
*  Rob Malley. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=142.92s)]
*  This guy's basic godfather was Yasser Arafat. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=144.2s)]
*  He had a security clearance taken away and we don't know exactly why. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  Here's some of that exchange yesterday. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=153.04s)]
*  Do you know Rob Malley? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=156.6s)]
*  I haven't. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=157.6s)]
*  Yes, I've known him. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=158.6s)]
*  I haven't talked to him in years. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=159.6s)]
*  Did he undertake efforts to quash sanctions enforcement on Iran? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  I do not recall Rob Malley having a role in the enforcement of sanctions. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=166.32s)]
*  Well very obviously something has dramatically changed here. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=172.6s)]
*  And it's clear to me that the Biden administration's enforcement of sanctions against Iran is every [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=175.68s)]
*  bit as ineffective as the Biden administration's enforcement of our border security. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=181.79999999999998s)]
*  Senator, is he going to get confirmed? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  Not with any Republican votes. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=190.28s)]
*  Brian, I think it's going to be a tough decision for the Democrats. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=191.76s)]
*  I hate to see them line up as they so often do and fall right over the cliff. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=194.84s)]
*  This is an insult to Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  We should put somebody in place. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=200.44s)]
*  We've got a very qualified Chargé d'Affaires right now that could bring her forward, nominate [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=201.48s)]
*  and confirm her quickly. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=206.2s)]
*  But instead they're going to send a proponent of Iran to serve Israel, to serve as our representative [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=207.8s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=215.04s)]
*  You think about it, Iran wants Israel wiped off the map and you've got this person who's [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=216.04s)]
*  been deeply involved in this flawed strategy to enrich Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=220.96s)]
*  I think it's quite an insult to our allies in Israel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=224.52s)]
*  It is. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=227.4s)]
*  The only hope we have is if Sinema, Manchin and Testa are worried about re-election or [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=228.44s)]
*  Sherrod Brown is worried about re-election, we'll stand up and make a stand here. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=233.48000000000002s)]
*  Senator, thanks so much for your challenging questions. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=238.16s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=240.08s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RrQKc9oJgA&t=241.08s)]
