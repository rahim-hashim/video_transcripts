# 'Squad' members UNRAVEL after Dems vote to censure Rashida Tlaib
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA)
*  All right 615 here in the East. Yeah, we've seen a lot of protests all around the country all around the world [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=0.0s)]
*  When it comes to Israel and there was a pro-palestinian rally yesterday. It was massive [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=5.36s)]
*  It was held here in Manhattan and it went over the Manhattan Bridge into Brooklyn [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=10.98s)]
*  They met at City Hall at 3 o'clock and some of the chants genocide Joe has to go. That's new listen [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=15.56s)]
*  Oh [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=30.0s)]
*  Never seen so many people be so wrong on such an important issue [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=48.28s)]
*  But I think I think eventually they're gonna grow up and be embarrassed that they stood out there [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=52.24s)]
*  They have no idea of for the most part what they're doing who they're standing up for people that just a month ago that day [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=56.760000000000005s)]
*  Chopped up innocent people who just wanted to have breakfast [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=63.84s)]
*  Or just have a normal life many of which gave their free time and volunteered to help the people of Gaza [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=67.72s)]
*  These guys couldn't even find Gaza on a map [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=73.16s)]
*  Well, and and as that was going on yesterday here in New York City [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=76.48s)]
*  280 miles south on the floor of the US House of Representatives [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=80.84s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib became the 26th member in the history of the House of Representatives to be censured [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=85.64s)]
*  22 Democrats actually voted with two hundred and twelve Republicans [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=92.60000000000001s)]
*  She was censured because the way the resolution read she defended the Hamas October 7th attack calling it resistance [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  and also calling for the annihilation of [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  Israel by [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=108.72s)]
*  Repeating that chant from the River to the sea Palestine will be free [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=110.84s)]
*  You would have to get rid of Israel for that the vote was supposed to be today, but they had it yesterday because [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=113.8s)]
*  Rich McCormick a Republican from the great state of Georgia was sponsoring this particular resolution [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=121.36s)]
*  He started getting death threats. Yeah in his office. And so it's like alright, let's just move it up and get it over with [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=128.92s)]
*  So what is the censure? It's a punishment one step below expulsion from Congress [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=134.44s)]
*  But she is well liked in her district because there's a large Arab community there and she won the election by a landslide [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so they're gonna be primary 22 Democrats voted against a voted with Republicans to censure her because they're embarrassed by her [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  Actually, many of them are Jewish. Yeah, and they also had two voted present one Republican voted present, but they did it [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=153.88s)]
*  But if usually if you're censured, there was some contrition [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=161.12s)]
*  Instead there was anger tears [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=164.16000000000003s)]
*  There was screaming Elon Omar was up there. Mr. Pulled a fire alarm Bowman was up there [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=166.48s)]
*  Screaming for her and at others for condemning her [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=173.2s)]
*  She held up a picture of a family member to talk about the Palestinians [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=177.2s)]
*  Which he doesn't acknowledge is who was all caused by the people who are elected by the Palestinians Hamas [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=180.72s)]
*  Whose goal is to wipe out the Israelis and the chant that she supports and [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=186.72s)]
*  And echoed has the Israel wiped off the face of the earth and one other thing is important [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=192.79999999999998s)]
*  Not only since you could trite she cut a slick 32nd and 62nd spot backing up and condemning the Democratic [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=198.79999999999998s)]
*  President while condemning those who would support Israel. So there's no way she had a slip of the tongue [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=206.28s)]
*  She is proud of what she did and I sadly I think some people will look at her as [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=212.0s)]
*  Look at her more positively now as if she's standing up for an admirable cause she's gonna be primaried [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  So we'll see if there's another Democrat. You'll probably seen that video [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=223.51999999999998s)]
*  We've been airing it on Fox just to show you an example of what she's posting on X [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=226.04s)]
*  But it's a video of her saying to Joe Biden have a message for you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=230.16s)]
*  I don't agree with you on this one and we're gonna remember it in 2024 [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=233.0s)]
*  Then it pans over to a protest and that's what they're yelling from the river to the sea and people had a problem with that [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=235.56s)]
*  Obviously well before they had the censured vote [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=240.44s)]
*  Democrats tried to get rid of that and that failed because she does have some supporters in Congress [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=242.96s)]
*  And as Brian mentioned a moment ago, they were very vocal and emotional and here's a little bit of it [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=249.32s)]
*  Do you realize what it's like? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=255.6s)]
*  Mr. Chair for the people outside the chamber right now listening in agony to their own government dehumanizing them [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=257.44s)]
*  To hear the president of the United States [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=264.04s)]
*  We helped elect dispute death tolls as we see video after video of dead children and parents under rubble [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=265.88s)]
*  This place is where 1700 members of Congress this elected body enslaved black people [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=271.76s)]
*  It's not surprising because they thought it was right racism and sexism [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=277.76s)]
*  Islamophobia get pushed off of elevators xenophobia and more right here in this workplace [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=281.96s)]
*  You lack the cognitive and emotional ability to recognize diverse opinions when they speak truth to power [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=286.36s)]
*  comments to the chair [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=294.56s)]
*  So [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=297.4s)]
*  Right, so because they say the Republicans aren't diverse enough to understand an anti-israeli chant [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=299.4s)]
*  Alright, so that's some of what's going on [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k0XqxyfFGA&t=306.0s)]
