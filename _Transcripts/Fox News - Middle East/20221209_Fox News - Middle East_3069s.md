*  Did the president get a heads up from Senator Sinema in advance of her announcement this [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=306.64000000000004s)]
*  morning that she would be registered as a Democrat? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=312.28000000000003s)]
*  So I will say this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=316.04s)]
*  As always, we do not discuss private conversations that we have with members of Congress. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=317.66s)]
*  We do have anything else to share outside of that, but we are just not going to share [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=322.98s)]
*  any private conversations that we have with Congress. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=326.22s)]
*  Did you talk about the president's reaction? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=328.06s)]
*  Was he surprised? [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=329.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, I put out a statement, and that, as you know, I speak for the president of the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  United States. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=334.42s)]
*  So he sees and we see Senator Sinema as a key partner on some of the most historic pieces [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=335.82s)]
*  of legislation that you all have covered in this administration. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=342.04s)]
*  When you look at the past 20 months, from the American Rescue Plan to the bipartisan [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=345.82s)]
*  infrastructure law to the Inflation Reduction Act to the Respect for Marriage Act, from [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=350.34s)]
*  the also the PACT Act, all of these pieces of legislation have been historic and we have [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=355.5s)]
*  partnered with Senator Sinema. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=360.14s)]
*  And so look, we understand her decision to register as an independent in Arizona. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=364.29999999999995s)]
*  The way we see it and understand it, it does not change the new Democratic majority control [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=369.94s)]
*  of the Senate. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=374.91999999999996s)]
*  reason to expect that we will continue to work with her successfully. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=377.18s)]
*  On a different topic, yesterday, as President Svapp, does the president believe that the [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=381.78000000000003s)]
*  deal that was struck by his administration with the Bush administration with Britney [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=386.98s)]
*  Greiner was a fair one, that that was a fair arrangement? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=390.14s)]
*  Look, and when I've talked about this yesterday as well, here's the way that we have seen [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=393.42s)]
*  this. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=400.94s)]
*  You know, when you talk about fair, Britney Greiner is an American citizen who was being [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=401.94s)]
*  held unjustly. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=406.66s)]
*  She was being held unjustly under intolerable circumstances. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=408.06s)]
*  That was what was happening to Britney Greiner. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=412.26s)]
*  And so that means something to the president. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=415.34s)]
*  He believes, you know, when you have an American passport, it means something. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=418.06s)]
*  And so he wanted to do everything that he could to make sure that he brought her home. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=423.18s)]
*  We were presented with an option, as you know, we've laid this out, you've heard from my [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=429.32s)]
*  NSC colleagues as well, where it was either Britney or no one. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=433.68s)]
*  That was the option that we were given. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  And so the president wanted to keep his promise in making sure that he brings American citizens [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=442.08000000000004s)]
*  home who are being wrongfully detained abroad. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=447.36s)]
*  That is a promise that his administration is continuing to fight for. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  And so that's what you saw. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=456.92s)]
*  You saw the same action that he took with Trevor Reed. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  He took with Britney Greiner and others, almost a dozen other wrongfully detained Americans [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=461.42s)]
*  have come home under his administration. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=469.0s)]
*  And he is going to continue to work very hard in his administration to work very hard to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=470.96000000000004s)]
*  bring Paul Whelan home. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=476.02000000000004s)]
*  Is that fair or not? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=477.56s)]
*  The way that we see it is that this was an opportunity to bring an American home. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  That's how we saw the deal that was presented to us. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=486.16s)]
*  And what was occurring is in the past week or two, we saw that from the Russians were [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=489.76000000000005s)]
*  willing to release Britney Greiner for Mr. Booth. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=495.56s)]
*  That was what was presented to us. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  They were not willing to, and I said this yesterday, to negotiate in good faith for [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=501.96000000000004s)]
*  Paul Whelan. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=507.24s)]
*  And so it was either Britney Greiner, one American or no American. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=508.70000000000005s)]
*  So that's how we see the negotiation that was presented in front of us. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=513.76s)]
*  And that's the very difficult decision that the president had to make. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=518.3599999999999s)]
*  And we were able to bring her home safely. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=522.68s)]
*  I understand you're not going to detail private conversations, but just to be clear, was the [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=524.68s)]
*  White House giving a heads up that Senator Sinema was going to be home? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=531.76s)]
*  I'm just not going to go into details on any private conversation that we have. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=536.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm just not going to go into details or lay out any private conversations that we have [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=540.88s)]
*  with Congress. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=545.36s)]
*  That's something that we normally do, just not going to do that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=546.36s)]
*  But that's just a private conversation. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=548.1600000000001s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=549.48s)]
*  Mary, I'm just not going to go into details on this. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=550.48s)]
*  Well, let me try this. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=554.6s)]
*  Just two days ago, you said that Warnock's win gave you a little bit more breathing room, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=556.84s)]
*  a little bit more ability to deliver for the American people. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=560.2800000000001s)]
*  Does Sinema's decision to leave the party take away some of that breathing room? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=563.44s)]
*  As I said, and I put out a statement on this, as you all know, as I said, that we see, we [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=568.2s)]
*  understand Senator Sinema's decision to register as an independent. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=573.28s)]
*  The way that we see it, it does not change the majority or it doesn't change the complexion [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=577.96s)]
*  of what our democratic majority is going to look like in the Senate. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=584.08s)]
*  How then does it impact you? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=587.76s)]
*  I mean, you're saying that this decision won't change at all how you work with her? [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=589.48s)]
*  Or you said that you expect that, or you have every reason to expect that you will continue [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=593.2s)]
*  to work successfully with Sinema. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=597.4s)]
*  Where does that expectation come from? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=599.28s)]
*  Because she has voted with the president 93 percent of the time because she has worked [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=600.68s)]
*  with us on key priorities of this administration. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=604.92s)]
*  When you think about his economic policy, I just laid out all of the different historic [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=608.04s)]
*  pieces of legislation that we have been able to get done. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=612.04s)]
*  And she has played a key role in that. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=615.56s)]
*  When you think about the Chips and Science Act, when you think about the bipartisan infrastructure [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=618.24s)]
*  law, those are pieces of legislation. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=621.48s)]
*  There's a long list of other things that she's worked with us on. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=625.0s)]
*  That's 93 percent. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=628.2s)]
*  And so we think that partnership will continue. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=630.04s)]
*  We do not see a change in our democratic majority as it relates to the Senate. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=632.96s)]
*  So we are very confident. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=637.64s)]
*  I'm going to call actually on Alex in the back because of what occurred yesterday. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=639.76s)]
*  I know Brett is not here, but I want to give you an opportunity to ask a question. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=644.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=648.76s)]
*  I wanted to ask about if the president has spoken with any gun violence prevention advocates [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=649.76s)]
*  or victims families ahead of the Sandy Hook anniversary? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=654.52s)]
*  And also if he has any plans to talk to lawmakers next week about his call for an assault weapons [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=657.88s)]
*  ban? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=662.48s)]
*  I don't have anything to preview at this time on any calls that the president might make [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=663.48s)]
*  or will make. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=668.72s)]
*  The president has talked about Sandy Hook being the worst day in his eight years as [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=670.04s)]
*  vice president. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=675.56s)]
*  And you can expect him to mark this sad day next week as I laid out in the week ahead. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=677.0s)]
*  On Wednesday, as you all saw, the president joined survivors and families impacted by [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=682.88s)]
*  gun violence to deliver remarks at the 10th annual National Vigil for All Victims of Gun [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=687.44s)]
*  Violence organized by the Newton Action Alliance. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=693.72s)]
*  The vigil was a service of mourning and loving remembrance for all who have fallen victim [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=697.12s)]
*  to the ongoing epidemic of gun violence in America. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=702.44s)]
*  And as you all know, the president has done more than speak about gun violence. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=705.1600000000001s)]
*  He's actually taking action. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=709.5400000000001s)]
*  He fought relentlessly to take action as well. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=711.28s)]
*  He has done more executive taking more executive action at this time in his presidency than [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=714.36s)]
*  any other president. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=719.28s)]
*  And so look, and let's not forget, he signed the most significant gun safety legislation [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=721.16s)]
*  in 30 years this summer, but he feels that is not enough and we need to do more. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=725.54s)]
*  And so he continues to call for the assault weapons ban. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=730.48s)]
*  He did that on that day on Wednesday when he when he was there with families and friends, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  speaking of this moment, and he's never going to stop showing up and speaking out. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=738.84s)]
*  And I have said this before, he believes his role as president is to make sure that we [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=743.6s)]
*  continue to put this continue to push this into the dialogue. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=748.4s)]
*  So making sure that the American people understand how important it is to talk about getting [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=752.4s)]
*  the assault weapons ban. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=757.96s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=758.96s)]
*  I want to follow up on Mary's question. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=759.96s)]
*  When she asked you why you feel confident that you'll be able to continue to work with [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=763.88s)]
*  Senator Sinema successfully, you cited her record. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=768.68s)]
*  But just to put a fine point on it, has the administration been given assurances by anyone [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=771.68s)]
*  within the senator's office or the senator herself that she is going to continue to work [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=777.24s)]
*  with you? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=781.56s)]
*  I'm just not going to divulge or speak to any private conversations that we have with [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=782.56s)]
*  members of Congress. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=787.84s)]
*  That is something that is not unusual. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=788.84s)]
*  That is something that I've said many times before. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=790.2s)]
*  On the question, what I'm saying is her actions speak to what we're trying to lay out here. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=792.9599999999999s)]
*  Ninety-three percent that she's voted with the president over the last 20 months. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=798.8s)]
*  I've listed out the historic pieces of legislation that she has played a significant role, that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=804.7199999999999s)]
*  she's played a key partner role with us. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=810.3199999999999s)]
*  And we don't see a change in the Democratic majority with her deciding to register as [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=813.88s)]
*  an independent. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=821.24s)]
*  Is Dr. Decaucus with Democrats? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=822.36s)]
*  Look, we don't see a change in the Democratic majority. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=824.36s)]
*  And so we see this as a decision that she has made, but we do not see a change in our [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=828.2s)]
*  Democratic majority. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=833.08s)]
*  Let me ask it this way, and then I do have one on Brittany Greiner. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=834.08s)]
*  Does Senator Sinema have the support of the president in this decision and moving forward [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=838.76s)]
*  into 2024? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=844.4s)]
*  So cannot speak to 2024. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=846.08s)]
*  I'm covered by the Hatch Act. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=848.04s)]
*  As far as I understand it, she hasn't announced her plans for 2024 yet. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=850.0400000000001s)]
*  So just not something that I'm going to speak to. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=855.24s)]
*  She has the support of the president right now. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=857.24s)]
*  Well, we see her as a key partner. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=859.24s)]
*  We understand her decision to register as an independent. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=861.76s)]
*  Let me ask you about something that Vladimir Putin said today. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=864.52s)]
*  As you know, he held that press conference and he said, more prisoner swaps may occur [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=867.52s)]
*  between the U.S. and Russia. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=872.96s)]
*  He said, quote, everything is possible. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=874.96s)]
*  What does the U.S. make of that? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=878.28s)]
*  What does the administration hear in this work? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=880.4399999999999s)]
*  So we're just not going to talk about any ongoing diplomatic conversations. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=882.52s)]
*  We've been very clear that we want the American people to know that their safety and security [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=887.9599999999999s)]
*  is among our highest priority when it comes to aggressively doing everything that we can [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=892.28s)]
*  to bring Americans home who are being wrongfully detained, bringing them home safely, but not [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=898.8s)]
*  going to get into any diplomatic conversations from here. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=903.8399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=908.88s)]
*  Now that Brittany Greiner is back on U.S. soil, has President Biden spoken to her or [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=909.88s)]
*  does he plan to? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=915.1999999999999s)]
*  So don't have any calls to preview. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=916.68s)]
*  As you know, the president spoke with her, Brittany Greiner, yesterday morning in the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=920.0s)]
*  seven o'clock, eight o'clock hour, right before he came out to speak to all of you and to [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=926.24s)]
*  give the announcement. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=930.6s)]
*  And the room was her wife and the vice president and Jake Sullivan and also the secretary of [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=932.1600000000001s)]
*  state. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=938.96s)]
*  And we've already read out what that conversation was like. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=939.96s)]
*  I do want to give a little bit more information on where we are this morning. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=944.24s)]
*  We can confirm, as you all know, that Brittany Greiner arrived at Joint Base San Antonio, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=950.36s)]
*  Fort Sam Houston early this morning. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=956.76s)]
*  She has been reunited with her wife, Sherrell. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=958.72s)]
*  U.S. officials who met her on the ground said she was in very good spirits, appears to be [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=961.24s)]
*  in good health. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=966.48s)]
*  She was immediately taken to Brooke Army Medical Center, where she is being offered a range [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=967.84s)]
*  of support options following her time detained in Russia. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=973.52s)]
*  So not going to get ahead of what's going to happen next. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=981.2s)]
*  What I can tell you is where she is currently today. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=984.6800000000001s)]
*  Every individual is different and those decisions are up to them and their families. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=987.64s)]
*  They'll take as much time as they need. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=993.24s)]
*  What we can say, typically upon arrival, people are offered a wide range of additional support, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=995.68s)]
*  including full medical checkup, a mental health checkup, and additional means of support. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1001.92s)]
*  All of this is voluntary, so it is up to her and her family. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1006.84s)]
*  Can you confirm the report that Russia wanted Vadim Krasikov, who is a Russian assassin, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1010.3199999999999s)]
*  being held in Germany in exchange for Paul Wieland? [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1018.16s)]
*  So I cannot go into any specifics or any negotiations, information from here. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1020.56s)]
*  As you know, we are working very hard to secure Paul's return, and so don't want to get ahead [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1028.68s)]
*  of what's currently happening, and I just want to leave it there. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1034.92s)]
*  Okay, well, did the U.S. have any conversations with a third party when they were negotiating [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1038.48s)]
*  the prisoner swap? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1045.96s)]
*  I'm just not going to get into specifics on any of the negotiations. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1046.96s)]
*  What I can tell you was that we realized, and I think I said this a moment ago, we realized [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1050.76s)]
*  about a week or two ago that Russia was willing to do a negotiation to release Brittany Greiner, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1056.8s)]
*  and that was Brittany Greiner for Mr. Booth, and that's what they offered. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  They were not negotiating in good faith when it came to Paul. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1070.24s)]
*  They categorized him very differently, and we've talked about that, unfortunately, in [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1074.24s)]
*  the illegitimate charges that they levied against Paul. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1079.04s)]
*  And so at this time, we were not able to secure his release. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1083.52s)]
*  I don't want to get into any specifics about negotiations as we continue to have those [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1089.16s)]
*  conversations to secure Paul. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1094.28s)]
*  Just one more quick one. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1096.76s)]
*  In order to get an American back, is the U.S. only willing to swap a Russian national, or [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1101.04s)]
*  would it consider trying to work with another country to get someone else? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  I get your question, and I understand. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1114.76s)]
*  I just cannot get into what we will or will not do any of the negotiations. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1116.84s)]
*  We have Americans out there who are wrongfully detained, being held hostage, and we want [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1122.3999999999999s)]
*  to make sure that we get them home safely, and negotiating from here or giving information [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1126.88s)]
*  on the internal mechanics of process certainly would not be prudent. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1132.72s)]
*  Thanks, Karine. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1138.72s)]
*  China is easing its COVID-0 restrictions. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1141.92s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could talk about whether something that the White House supports or [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1144.92s)]
*  doesn't, and specifically how you see it playing out for U.S. manufacturing that has operations [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1149.92s)]
*  in China, do you think it will improve supply chains because there will be less restrictions [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1156.08s)]
*  on workers, or is there concern, both medical and economic, about if there are wide-scale [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1161.6799999999998s)]
*  outbreaks of COVID in China now? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1168.6s)]
*  Any policies of the PRC, I'm certainly not going to comment about them from here. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1172.48s)]
*  What we have been very clear about is China's COVID policy is not a policy we are pursuing [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1176.84s)]
*  here. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1182.08s)]
*  In the United States, we are focused on what works, like encouraging Americans to get their [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1183.08s)]
*  updated vaccine, which we try to do as often as we can from here and also just more broadly [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1187.4399999999998s)]
*  in the administration, and making testing and treatment easily accessible. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1192.72s)]
*  That is going to be our focus. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1197.12s)]
*  We're just not going to comment on PRC's policies. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1199.76s)]
*  Fox Business had a report today that Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan is on a shortlist [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1202.24s)]
*  to replace Janet Yellen, and when she decides to leave the administration. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1209.72s)]
*  I'm wondering if you could comment on that. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1212.72s)]
*  As Secretary Yellen said herself just last month, she has no plans to leave. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1214.64s)]
*  It seems to be that report to us seems to be pure speculation. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1218.8s)]
*  I have two questions. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1222.8s)]
*  The first one is on... [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1225.8s)]
*  I thought you were going to talk to me in French. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1228.8s)]
*  I was going to be like, oh gosh. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1231.8s)]
*  My mom's now watching. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1232.8s)]
*  First thing is on the statement that came out today about Canada and the US taking coordinated [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1233.8799999999999s)]
*  sanctions against Iranian officials connected to human rights abuse. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1242.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm trying to figure out why this coordination with Canada in this very instance. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1247.8799999999999s)]
*  First of all, it's good to see you. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  It's been a while, a long time. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1254.8799999999999s)]
*  I know I made a joke, but it is good to see you. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1255.8799999999999s)]
*  I just want to say at the top, the United States is committed to supporting the Iranian [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1258.8799999999999s)]
*  people and imposing costs on those responsible for the brutal crackdown. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1262.96s)]
*  We continue to coordinate with allies and partners and find ways to confront Iran's [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1267.96s)]
*  human rights abuses, both in public and also in private. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1272.96s)]
*  The joint US-Canada statement today is an example of this effort. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1276.96s)]
*  We took coordinated sanctions against actions, pardon me, today against Iranian officials [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1280.96s)]
*  connected to human rights abuses, including those committed as part of the ongoing brutal [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1287.04s)]
*  crackdown aimed at denying the Iranian people their human rights and their fundamental freedoms, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1293.04s)]
*  their fundamental rights. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1299.04s)]
*  So we'll continue to support the Iranian people. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1300.04s)]
*  I can't speak to Canada. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1303.04s)]
*  You would have to speak to their government, as I'm sure you do often, but I can't speak [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1305.04s)]
*  to different countries reasoning for their own reasoning for taking action. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1311.04s)]
*  But clearly, this is an important action that shows support for the Iranian people as we're [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1315.12s)]
*  seeing this truly brutal crackdown on the civilians there. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1321.12s)]
*  My other question is on the next week's summit, the African Leaders Summit. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1325.12s)]
*  We're going to get into details, but I'm trying to figure out how much do the Chinese [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1331.12s)]
*  intense economic involvement and the Russian through Wagner military involvement is playing [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1338.1999999999998s)]
*  a role in the president's willingness to engage even more intensely with the leaders? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1345.1999999999998s)]
*  What I can say, our focus next week is going to be on Africa. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1351.1999999999998s)]
*  That's going to be the focus of the summit. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1355.1999999999998s)]
*  This summit is an opportunity to deepen the many partnerships we have on the African continent. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1357.1999999999998s)]
*  We will focus on our efforts to strengthen these partnerships across a wide range of [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1363.28s)]
*  sectors, spanning from businesses to health to peace and security, but our focus will [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1368.28s)]
*  be on Africa next week. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1374.28s)]
*  Can you provide any updates on what the president is doing to push for the government's spending bill? [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1378.28s)]
*  I've talked about this many times, and we believe getting the government funding done [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1384.28s)]
*  is critical and it's going to be important. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1390.36s)]
*  This is something that we encourage and continue to talk to Congress about getting this done. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1392.36s)]
*  I talked about how Shalonda Young is leading, certainly leading that effort, our OMB director, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1398.36s)]
*  and she knows how to get bipartisan deals done here. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1404.36s)]
*  Look, we were able to get government funding done in a bipartisan way last year. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1408.36s)]
*  We believe it should be done in a bipartisan way this year. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1414.36s)]
*  There is enough time to get this done. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1417.36s)]
*  We are talking about critical resources that the American people need. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1419.4399999999998s)]
*  When you think about public health, public education, our national security, these are [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1423.4399999999998s)]
*  all incredibly important and it should be done in a bipartisan way and there's enough [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1427.4399999999998s)]
*  time to get that moving. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1432.24s)]
*  As families are facing rising school lunch debt, can you also provide an update as to [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1434.24s)]
*  what the president is doing to push forward free school meals for all? [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1439.74s)]
*  So, the president, as you've heard him say, is proud that his American Rescue Plan provided [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1443.74s)]
*  additional emergency food and nutrition assistance for those in need, building on our $60 million [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1449.16s)]
*  investment in farm to school initiatives. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1456.16s)]
*  Our national strategy on hunger, nutrition, and health, which we released in September, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1458.72s)]
*  includes a provision on creating a path to free health school meals for all children. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1464.0s)]
*  As a first step in reaching this goal, the administration is committed to working with [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1469.4s)]
*  Congress to expand access to healthy free school meals to an additional 9 million kids [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1472.8000000000002s)]
*  over the next decade. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1478.84s)]
*  But obviously, this has been a priority for this president since the beginning of his administration. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1480.36s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1485.84s)]
*  Just a follow-up on Iran and human rights. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1486.84s)]
*  Iran just executed a man for his involvement in the anti-government protests. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1490.84s)]
*  Other detainees also faced the possibility of the death penalty related to the protest. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1495.84s)]
*  Can you speak more specifically on those instances? [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1500.84s)]
*  So we denounce these draconian sentences in the strongest terms. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1504.1799999999998s)]
*  These sentences are meant to intimidate people and suppress dissent. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1509.8999999999999s)]
*  And so they will not work. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1515.22s)]
*  And Iran's leadership continues its violent crackdown as they do that on peaceful protesters. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1518.02s)]
*  They should know that the world is watching. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1523.54s)]
*  I just talked about a letter that was signed by our allies, really calling that out, continuing [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1525.1s)]
*  to do that. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1534.52s)]
*  So the United States is committing to supporting the Iranian people and imposing costs on those [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1535.52s)]
*  responsible for the brutal crackdown. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1539.2s)]
*  Just today, again, we announced the sanctions to hold Iran accountable for human rights [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1541.2s)]
*  abuses. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1545.96s)]
*  We continue to coordinate with allies and partners and find ways to confront Iran's [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1546.96s)]
*  human rights abuses, both, again, as I said earlier, in public and in private. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1551.5s)]
*  We will stand with Iranian civilians as they are fighting for their basic freedom, their [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1555.5800000000002s)]
*  basic human rights. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1562.6999999999998s)]
*  And we will continue to denounce that. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1564.1s)]
*  OK, and another question on Saudi, please. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1565.78s)]
*  Does President Biden plan to follow through with his statement that there will be consequences [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1569.4199999999998s)]
*  on Saudi Arabia following their oil production cuts? [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1573.8s)]
*  Or is the understanding now that gas prices have stabilized, so perhaps it's not as urgent [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1576.9399999999998s)]
*  for those consequences to happen? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1582.4199999999998s)]
*  And just more broadly speaking, does the growing ties between Saudi and China, does that play [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1584.1s)]
*  a role in the administration's reassessment of relations with Saudis that were promised [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1590.74s)]
*  to us? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1596.78s)]
*  So there's a couple of things there, kind of laid out a couple of items that I'll touch [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1597.78s)]
*  on. [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1601.5800000000002s)]
*  So look, the gas prices that we're seeing currently that are going down is because of [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1602.5800000000002s)]
*  the work that this president has done. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1607.14s)]
*  It's because he took historic action to tap into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1608.6200000000001s)]
*  And because of those actions, we're seeing prices go down. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1614.14s)]
*  So I want to be very, very clear on that. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1617.22s)]
*  So as far as the relationship, the review that you're asking me about, we are assessing [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1619.86s)]
*  relations with Saudi Arabia methodologically and strategically as we have done over the [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1624.82s)]
*  last 80 years of this relationship in a bipartisan way. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1629.26s)]
*  And we're going to do this in line with what's in our interest. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1634.7s)]
*  And we will judge the way forward based on their actions as well as our ongoing consultations [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1639.36s)]
*  with partners and allies and also the new Congress that is going to be before us very [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1645.0s)]
*  soon and the Saudis as well. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1649.8s)]
*  Don't have anything more to share. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1652.36s)]
*  But again, remember, this is an 80, as you know, an 80 year history. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1653.52s)]
*  And as we have reevaluated over the course of those eight decades in a bipartisan way. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1658.76s)]
*  And that's how we're looking to move forward. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1664.16s)]
*  And just really quickly, last one on Taiwan. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1665.8s)]
*  Can you comment on the timing of the $425 million arms sales with Taiwan earlier this [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1668.2s)]
*  week, which happened on the same day that the president went to Arizona to visit the [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1674.08s)]
*  TSMC plant, which is of course part of the effort to get ahead of the strategic rivalry [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1678.64s)]
*  with China. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1683.4s)]
*  Is there any kind of messaging here that these two events happened on the same day? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1684.4s)]
*  So there's no connection. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1687.6s)]
*  I can say pretty affirmatively there's no connection there. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1688.6s)]
*  This was a package of upgrades on pre-existing sale. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1691.84s)]
*  I think we've talked about that here before in the briefing room. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1695.04s)]
*  We continue to support Taiwan's self-defense consistent with our longstanding one China [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1698.76s)]
*  policy. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1704.4s)]
*  So no change there. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1705.4s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1706.4s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1707.4s)]
*  I've got two questions for you. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1708.4s)]
*  The first about the coronavirus pandemic and then one about Twitter. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1709.4s)]
*  On the pandemic, the former vice president of the EcoHealth Alliance has a new book out [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1713.64s)]
*  and he says that he's convinced that COVID-19 leaked from a Wuhan lab. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1718.12s)]
*  To my knowledge, he hasn't produced any direct evidence, but he speculates that a risky U.S. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1723.6s)]
*  funded research caused the pandemic. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1729.1200000000001s)]
*  Does the U.S. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1730.68s)]
*  government have a response to that? [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1731.68s)]
*  So I would refer you to the NIH on that, but a couple of things and EcoHealth as well for [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1733.1200000000001s)]
*  specifics here on the question that you have. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1738.0800000000002s)]
*  But we do not know the origins, as you know, of COVID because of China's lack of transparency. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1741.28s)]
*  As I've said before, you know, this is something we, including the president, have pressed [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1747.48s)]
*  China on repeatedly. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1753.24s)]
*  NIH has exhaustively communicated the oversight of its scientific work and its purpose to [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1755.3200000000002s)]
*  ensure pandemic preparedness. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1761.44s)]
*  It's quite wonky, as you know. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1764.68s)]
*  And so again, I would refer you to NIH again. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1766.74s)]
*  It's very in-depth and that's the place that I would refer you to to get more specifics. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1769.3600000000001s)]
*  Just a very brief follow up before turning to Twitter. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1773.5600000000002s)]
*  Dr. Fauci's agency recently resumed funding for the EcoHealth Alliance. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1776.92s)]
*  Is there any concern about that given its past risky research in Wuhan? [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1781.8s)]
*  And if you're not able to speak to that, I was wondering if you could perhaps invite [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1786.24s)]
*  Dr. Fauci back here to take some more questions. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1789.56s)]
*  I would refer you to NIH. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1792.96s)]
*  They would provide you with the information directly. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1794.44s)]
*  So I'll just leave that there. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1797.68s)]
*  On Twitter, Elon Musk this week fired the former FBI General Counsel Jim Baker, who [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1799.44s)]
*  was serving as a top Twitter lawyer. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1805.44s)]
*  Musk alleges that he may have been involved with countermanding his attempts at transparency. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1807.88s)]
*  And I was wondering if anyone in the Biden administration was in touch with Baker either [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1813.16s)]
*  regarding moderation decisions that critics call political censorship or regarding his [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1818.0800000000002s)]
*  transparency efforts recently. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1822.44s)]
*  So it's up to private companies to make these types of decisions. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1824.2800000000002s)]
*  We were not involved. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1828.22s)]
*  I can say that. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1829.48s)]
*  We were not involved. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1830.68s)]
*  And as I've said several times this week already, we've talked, we've had this conversation [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1832.16s)]
*  many times in this briefing room just the past couple of days. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1836.56s)]
*  Of course, it's up to these companies to make their own decisions about the content on their [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1841.8s)]
*  platform and to ensure content flows there on standards and on their own standards and [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1847.0s)]
*  policies. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1852.2s)]
*  Don't have anything more to share. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1853.2s)]
*  Just very briefly on the not involved in speaking with Baker about this transparency effort [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1854.2s)]
*  by Musk. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1860.4s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1861.4s)]
*  That the Biden administration wasn't involved? [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1862.4s)]
*  We were just not involved. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1864.4s)]
*  We were not involved. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1867.04s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1868.04s)]
*  Thanks, Reem. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1869.04s)]
*  I can probably cross this question to some degree. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1870.04s)]
*  The official commutation order for Victor Booth was signed by the president on December [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1872.04s)]
*  2nd, which was five days before everything actually transpired. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1876.04s)]
*  Why? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1880.04s)]
*  Did that mean that the deal was done then or you did it in preparation for a deal? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1881.04s)]
*  How does that actually work? [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1887.04s)]
*  So as I've stated before, well, you just stated that about the clemency. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1888.52s)]
*  Look, we knew about a week or two ago that there was going to be a deal for Britney [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1894.6s)]
*  Greiner, and that was what the Russians had presented to us. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1900.9199999999998s)]
*  And they wanted the deal, right, to secure her return was Mr. Booth for Britney Greiner. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1906.48s)]
*  And so that was the deal that was presented to us. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1917.7199999999998s)]
*  And that's how we move forward because we wanted to make sure we brought one American [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1920.56s)]
*  home. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1924.0s)]
*  It was either no American or one American. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1925.0s)]
*  And so that process was about a week or two ago. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1927.6s)]
*  I can't go into detail specifics on the five days or when things were signed. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1930.6s)]
*  I don't have that information to provide for you at this time. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1934.76s)]
*  But we learned that about the last week or two ago. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1937.64s)]
*  Preparatory, nothing was final until Britney Greiner was in the custody of you? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1941.12s)]
*  You know, I kind of laid out kind of the process yesterday or how that all worked. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1945.52s)]
*  I don't have that in front of me to share with you at this time. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1952.0s)]
*  But what I can say is the past week or two, we learned from the Russians that they were [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1955.0s)]
*  willing to release Britney Greiner for Mr. Booth. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1961.8s)]
*  And we tried throughout the past several months, as you know, the past six months since we [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1967.0s)]
*  heard from Secretary Blinken back in July saying that we were in intensive conversation [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1971.68s)]
*  to get Britney home, to get Paul Whelan home. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1979.24s)]
*  In every conversation over the last several months, we worked very hard to get the both [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1982.48s)]
*  of them home. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1987.24s)]
*  That was always a priority. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1988.24s)]
*  And again, it wasn't until very recently that we learned that they were only willing to [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1989.84s)]
*  make an arrangement for Britney Greiner. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1995.8s)]
*  And Paul Whelan, as I've stated many times before, was just seen differently in an illegitimate [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=1999.36s)]
*  way. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2004.6s)]
*  And so the president wanted to make sure we brought an American home. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2006.0s)]
*  And that's what we saw yesterday. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2010.6s)]
*  In terms of legislatively, I know you guys are very much in the lame duck zone right [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2011.6s)]
*  now. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2016.96s)]
*  But has the last week either changed or spurred the planning for the next Congress legislatively, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2017.96s)]
*  how you guys approach the next Congress? [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2026.12s)]
*  Or has it shifted at all by what happened this morning? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2027.84s)]
*  What happened this morning? [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2030.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2031.6s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2032.6s)]
*  That's the point that I'm trying to make here. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2034.32s)]
*  You have someone, Senator Sinema, who has voted with the president 93% of the time on [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2036.28s)]
*  key important historic pieces of legislation. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2043.76s)]
*  And I listed them out earlier. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2047.1799999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to bore you by doing that again. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2048.68s)]
*  But they were important pieces of legislation that you all covered and we've talked about [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2051.56s)]
*  in this briefing room. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2056.24s)]
*  And so we do not see, we understand why she would want to register as an independent, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2057.58s)]
*  but we do not see the democratic majority changing with this decision that she's made. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2063.74s)]
*  I just want to ask you on the oil price cap. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2068.7799999999997s)]
*  So there's 20 oil-laden tankers now sort of stuck trying to get out of the Black Sea [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2071.38s)]
*  into the Turkish straits. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2077.38s)]
*  I know that Treasury officials have been in touch with Turkish officials on this. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2079.38s)]
*  Are you looking at escalating that conversation to a higher level? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2086.1800000000003s)]
*  Are you frustrated with Turkey's reluctance to back away from this rule? [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2091.1800000000003s)]
*  Somebody's having a good time. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2097.1800000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2099.1800000000003s)]
*  So as you said, we've been in touch with Turkey about how the price cap only applies to Russian [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2100.1800000000003s)]
*  oil and explain that the cap doesn't necessitate additional checks on ships passing through [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2106.18s)]
*  Turkish waters. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2115.1s)]
*  Our understanding is that virtually all of the delayed tankers are not carrying oil from [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2116.62s)]
*  Russia and are not affected by the cap. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2122.18s)]
*  So Turkey has made clear they share our interest in a well-supplied market and allowing seaborne [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2125.14s)]
*  oil to transit the Turkish straits. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2132.14s)]
*  They have made clear their goal is to resolve this issue as quickly as possible. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2136.3399999999997s)]
*  And so again, we've been in touch with Turkey and this is how we're moving forward. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2141.3399999999997s)]
*  It doesn't seem to be resolved at all. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2146.3399999999997s)]
*  I mean, there's 28 tankers now and now on top of it, you've got the Turkish officials [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2148.3399999999997s)]
*  saying they don't see any reason to rescind that. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2153.98s)]
*  Well, in our conversation, they want to resolve this issue. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2156.74s)]
*  And we are again having those conversations with Turkey and we feel like we are going [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2160.88s)]
*  to get to a place where this will get resolved. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2165.12s)]
*  OK. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2167.48s)]
*  And then let me follow up on oil production. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2168.48s)]
*  The Russians have said they could cut oil production to sort of avoid having to sell [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2170.12s)]
*  below the cap. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2177.12s)]
*  You know, are you in any way sort of considering that this oil price cap was not a success [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2178.92s)]
*  or will not be a success because of these various responses? [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2188.08s)]
*  Look, we're not surprised by Putin's reaction and response and what Russia is saying. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2193.08s)]
*  Look, the price will lock in a discount on Russian oil, especially in light of the $100 [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2199.08s)]
*  per barrel they earned just a few months ago. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2205.4s)]
*  And it can be adjusted over time to prevent Russia from further profiteering from its [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2207.68s)]
*  war. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2212.92s)]
*  And we see this as an opportunity. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2213.92s)]
*  This is an unprecedented action that demonstrates the unity of the United States and our allies [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2216.68s)]
*  and partners. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2221.2s)]
*  So again, you know, I'm not going to be when it comes to, you know, slowing, limiting their [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2222.44s)]
*  flow. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2227.3199999999997s)]
*  We're not in the business of responding to a hypothetical as well, but wanted to lay [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2228.56s)]
*  out how we see this process moving forward. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2232.3999999999996s)]
*  And we don't and we don't know what will happen. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2234.48s)]
*  But as we have said, we are focused on limiting Putin's ability to profit from rising prices [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2237.6s)]
*  to fund his illegal war while promoting stable, stable global energy markets. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2243.04s)]
*  This is not about this is not about Russian oil of the market. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2248.2000000000003s)]
*  This is about the cap. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2251.92s)]
*  The cap at this level maintains clear incentives for Russia to continue exporting. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2253.28s)]
*  And we believe that it should. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2259.1000000000004s)]
*  Can I just ask you a domestic question? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2260.52s)]
*  So Maxwell Frost was denied, you know, an apartment or application because of really [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2263.2000000000003s)]
*  bad credit. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2269.6400000000003s)]
*  Are you I know that you looked at housing inequities and problems facing people of color [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2271.56s)]
*  in terms of getting housing and just fairness in the housing market. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2279.72s)]
*  This practice of requiring credit applications and then fees that carry a fee seems to be [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2284.72s)]
*  something that's happening all over the country. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2292.56s)]
*  Is there anything that the White House or that the Biden administration can do to curb [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2294.68s)]
*  what seems to be a predatory practice in some cases where people are basically in order [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2300.68s)]
*  to even get a chance of getting an apartment in this very tight and difficult housing market [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2306.44s)]
*  to pay money upfront? [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2310.24s)]
*  So what the president and the administration understands that Americans are struggling [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2312.24s)]
*  with high cost of housing. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2317.24s)]
*  That is something that we have seen throughout these past several years. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2318.72s)]
*  And that's why the president released his housing supply action plan that we have talked [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2323.56s)]
*  about and it's to ease the burden, that burden of housing cost over time by using a mix of [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2328.12s)]
*  administrative and legislative actions to boost the supply of quality housing in every [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2334.6s)]
*  community. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2339.84s)]
*  Just last month, the White House hosted a range of tenants and tenant advocates for [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2340.88s)]
*  listening sessions along with federal agencies. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2345.2400000000002s)]
*  We'll have more conversations like these and we'll add the topics that you're just [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2348.64s)]
*  laying out. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2356.56s)]
*  But again, that's why the president took initiative with his plan. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2357.56s)]
*  I've talked about the different specifics of the plan and how it's going to help folks [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2360.64s)]
*  who feel that burden because we also understand housing costs again is one of the things that [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2364.7999999999997s)]
*  has a big effect on people's lives and livelihoods. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2369.52s)]
*  So this is a priority for this administration. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2372.64s)]
*  Thanks, Karine. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2375.12s)]
*  I wanted to ask an earlier Russia question another way. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2376.68s)]
*  So when Putin says that nothing is off the table with future prisoner swaps, what in [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2380.64s)]
*  your view is the best way for the American people who may just be turning into this issue [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2385.52s)]
*  based on what happened with Brittany Greiner to actually think about what Putin is saying? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2391.0s)]
*  Should it be seen as a substantive offer to engage? [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2395.8399999999997s)]
*  Should it be viewed with skepticism? [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2398.3599999999997s)]
*  Should it heighten hopes that Paul Whelan could be brought home? [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2401.08s)]
*  I'm wondering if you can just set expectations based on the current state of play between [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2404.3599999999997s)]
*  our two countries. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2408.24s)]
*  So I can say this and the president said this yesterday. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2409.24s)]
*  He is committed to getting Paul Whelan home. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2412.08s)]
*  That is a commitment that he has made to his family and that is a commitment that he's [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2415.3599999999997s)]
*  made to the American people. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2420.24s)]
*  And more broadly speaking, the president since the beginning of his administration has said [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2421.8799999999997s)]
*  that his one of his top priorities is making sure that all Americans who are who are being [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2427.24s)]
*  wrongfully detained and held hostage are brought home. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2432.4s)]
*  And you know, we have seen this multiple times throughout this past 20 months. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2436.6800000000003s)]
*  Again, Trevor Reed, we saw in April the president bring home Brittany Greiner clearly yesterday [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2440.84s)]
*  and about 12 other American citizens. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2446.52s)]
*  And so the president's going to stay committed to that. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2451.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm not going to get into what President Putin says or not say or I'm just not going to [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2454.1200000000003s)]
*  get into his head. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2459.84s)]
*  That's not something that we do from here. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2461.36s)]
*  What I will say is that we are going to continue to negotiate in good faith to get Paul home. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2462.36s)]
*  Good. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2470.36s)]
*  Karen. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2471.36s)]
*  To follow up from the other day on the NDAA, the House has now passed this legislation. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2472.36s)]
*  It does rescind the military vaccine mandate, which you made clear the president does not [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2477.8s)]
*  agree with. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2482.1200000000003s)]
*  Will the president sign this legislation or veto it? [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2483.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm just not going to get ahead of the president. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2486.48s)]
*  This is something that the president decides on. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2489.04s)]
*  We've been very clear while we stand on the vaccine mandates. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2492.54s)]
*  And we've said it many times before, you know, Republicans in Congress have decided that [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2496.5s)]
*  they'd rather fight against the health and well-being of our troops than protect them. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2500.5s)]
*  And we think that it's a mistake. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2505.7400000000002s)]
*  Look, not going to again, not going to get ahead of the any final votes that may occur. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2508.2200000000003s)]
*  You talked about the House every year. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2512.54s)]
*  The NDAA has some provisions we support and some we don't. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2514.62s)]
*  So the president will judge this in its entirety. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2518.78s)]
*  I know, again, I noted that the House is moving on this, but I'm just not going to get of [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2521.2200000000003s)]
*  any decision that the president's going to make. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2527.6200000000003s)]
*  You have not yet made a decision. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2529.42s)]
*  I just haven't. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2530.42s)]
*  I have not spoken to him about this. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2531.42s)]
*  And so I'm just not going to get ahead of him. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2533.02s)]
*  Thanks, Karen. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2534.82s)]
*  Senator Sinema didn't travel with the president earlier this week to Arizona. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2535.82s)]
*  So do you know when the last time that they spoke was? [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2540.82s)]
*  I don't have a last time that they spoke. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2543.26s)]
*  So don't have anything to share with you at this time on that. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2549.1800000000003s)]
*  While he was in Arizona, he called her, quote, a tremendous advocate for the people of Arizona [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2551.5s)]
*  and a leader in so many issues important to the state, end quote. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2555.78s)]
*  Does he regret making that statement, which could be viewed as an endorsement given to [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2559.42s)]
*  the state? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2563.86s)]
*  I mean, he says this about many congressional members when he visits a state. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2564.86s)]
*  I've been on many trips with him. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2570.1000000000004s)]
*  He says that he thanks them for the passport to their state. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2572.94s)]
*  And he actually talks about the work that he's done with that congressperson or senator [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2577.2599999999998s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2584.06s)]
*  That is very, very common. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2585.06s)]
*  You can look at almost any every speech that he's made while he's visited the state. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2587.3199999999997s)]
*  And he talks about and lists how these congressional members and senators, House members have he's [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2591.88s)]
*  worked with them to deliver, whether it's the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2598.3s)]
*  whether it's the American Rescue Plan, whether it is the Inflation Reduction Act or all. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2602.34s)]
*  So that is not uncommon. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2608.5800000000004s)]
*  He does that very regularly. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2609.86s)]
*  I would say every time he goes to a state, he lifts up the congressional members who [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2611.38s)]
*  represent that state. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2619.3s)]
*  And on another topic, this is the point the administration, I think to Justin's point, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2620.3s)]
*  where people do start thinking about leaving. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2624.5s)]
*  Have any members of the president's cabinet informed him of a decision to leave in the [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2626.78s)]
*  next few months? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2630.9s)]
*  As far as I know, no. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2632.34s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2633.34s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2634.34s)]
*  Has the U.S. reached out directly to Syria to seek Austin Tice's release? [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2635.34s)]
*  His family issued a statement saying the NSC has failed to meet with the Syrians to work [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2641.02s)]
*  with them. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2645.3s)]
*  Look, you know, I don't want to get, again, trying to be very careful here, not going [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2646.3s)]
*  any negotiations or personal conversations that we may be having with a wrongfully detained [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2651.88s)]
*  or someone who is being held abroad. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2658.88s)]
*  We want to be very careful here. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2661.84s)]
*  Don't want to get into diplomatic discussions. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2664.0s)]
*  What I will say is that this president is committed, as I've said many times, as he [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2667.32s)]
*  has said, to do everything that he possibly can to bring home Americans who are wrongfully [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2671.8s)]
*  detained and held hostage. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2677.96s)]
*  That is a commitment that you have seen. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2680.04s)]
*  He has promised and kept over the past several months. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2683.8s)]
*  And following up from earlier in the week, do you know if the president has counted the [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2688.6s)]
*  votes to determine if he will seek an assault weapons ban during the Languedoc? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2692.4s)]
*  I don't have anything more to share beyond what I said a couple days ago. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2696.16s)]
*  You don't know if he's counted the votes? [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2699.8s)]
*  I just don't. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2701.4s)]
*  I haven't. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2702.4s)]
*  I don't have an update for you at this time. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2703.4s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2705.16s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2706.16s)]
*  Thanks, Greene. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2707.16s)]
*  On the economy. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2708.3599999999997s)]
*  We saw the producer price index come down a bit, but it's still above 7%. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2709.3599999999997s)]
*  The Federal Reserve Chairman says that core inflation may be moving sideways. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2717.08s)]
*  We get a CPI inflation reading again next week. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2720.52s)]
*  So if Americans don't see significant progress on inflation, does that mean the Inflation [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2724.16s)]
*  Reduction Act early next year hasn't worked? [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2727.98s)]
*  Okay. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2731.68s)]
*  Let's step back for a second. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2732.68s)]
*  So near-term inflation expectation fell this month. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2734.64s)]
*  So that's important. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2737.58s)]
*  We saw that in the data. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2738.58s)]
*  So it's important to call out. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2739.7999999999997s)]
*  The producer price index rose at its slowest annual rate since May 2021. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2741.5s)]
*  So that is data points that we saw in the index today. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2747.7799999999997s)]
*  Americans are beginning to see a much-needed break in inflation, but we have more work [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2752.7799999999997s)]
*  to do. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2756.98s)]
*  And so gas prices have fallen about $1.70 since June and are lower than they were a [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2758.1s)]
*  year ago before Putin's war. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2763.52s)]
*  That's because of the work that this president has done to bring gas prices down, to deal [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2766.18s)]
*  with an issue that matters to the American people when we look at the economy, which [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2770.58s)]
*  is inflation and cost. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2775.02s)]
*  So millions of Americans shopping for health insurance plans continue to save $800 per [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2777.48s)]
*  year thanks to the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2782.8599999999997s)]
*  So yes, it's been beneficial and we see that it is working. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2785.18s)]
*  And in six weeks, President Biden's plan to bring down prescription drugs, prescription [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2789.66s)]
*  drug prices and energy costs goes into effect. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2795.02s)]
*  And that's going to matter for the American people as they think about when they sit around [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2797.86s)]
*  their kitchen table, you hear the president talk about this at the end of the month, trying [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2802.98s)]
*  to figure out how are they going to pay for items in their house. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2806.78s)]
*  And these, what I just listed out or in their lives, is going to matter. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2810.2200000000003s)]
*  Lowering costs, health care costs, lowering energy costs. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2815.78s)]
*  We're already seeing that it's going to have a real effect on American families. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2819.2999999999997s)]
*  And so I will leave it there. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2824.74s)]
*  But you had said the inflation, before the midterms, you told me that the Inflation Reduction [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2826.54s)]
*  Act should bring down inflation early next year. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2830.02s)]
*  So if it doesn't do that significantly, is that seen as the event? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2832.7s)]
*  First of all, that's a bunch of hypotheticals that you're asking me. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2836.9399999999996s)]
*  What I laid out was something that economists said by looking at the Inflation Reduction [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2840.5s)]
*  Act, by examining it and understanding what it's going to do for the American people. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2845.1s)]
*  You're bringing up a hypothetical. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2850.1s)]
*  What I said was, again, what was the analysis that was done by economists. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2851.8199999999997s)]
*  And I just laid out also how we see the Inflation Reduction Act is actually going to help the [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2857.9s)]
*  American people. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2863.86s)]
*  And that matters. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2865.18s)]
*  And you know, I have to say, Ed, and just going back to the past several months as well, [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2867.06s)]
*  look, the Inflation Reduction Act was a piece of legislation that was signed by the president [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2872.9s)]
*  that was only passed by Democrats. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2877.06s)]
*  And what you saw from Republican officials over the past several months is how they wanted [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2879.84s)]
*  to get rid of it because they were upset about Social Security. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2884.68s)]
*  They wanted to put Medicare on the chopping block. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2890.86s)]
*  And they have no plan to lower in costs. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2893.64s)]
*  So what you're seeing from this administration, what you're seeing from this president, what [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2896.18s)]
*  you're seeing from Democrats in DC, in Congress, is that they are taking action to lower costs [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2898.94s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2905.42s)]
*  And that matters. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2906.98s)]
*  And that's what we're going to continue to do. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2907.98s)]
*  Senator, one question. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2908.98s)]
*  And to your housekeeping question, following up on what I think Karen was asking about, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2909.98s)]
*  the House has already voted on the NDAA. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2916.54s)]
*  The Senate most likely take it up this week. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2919.2200000000003s)]
*  Did the Senate expect to know what the position of the president is on the bill before they [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2923.02s)]
*  vote on it? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2929.34s)]
*  I mean, we've been very clear when I've been asked about the vaccine mandate. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2930.34s)]
*  We thought that that was a mistake. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2933.54s)]
*  You know, and it wasn't just from the president. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2936.06s)]
*  It was also from the Senate and Congress received a letter from Secretary Austin saying how [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2938.54s)]
*  important, how they, he believed in how important the vaccine mandate was. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2945.06s)]
*  What I'm saying is we want to look at, and the president, and not just this president, [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2949.54s)]
*  other presidents have been able to judge the package in its entirety. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2954.42s)]
*  And so that's what we're looking to do. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2959.02s)]
*  But we're also going to be very vocal, as we have been, on what happened and occurred [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2962.34s)]
*  with the vaccine mandate in the NDAA. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2966.74s)]
*  On another end of the year item, obviously there's the spending package which was discussed [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2970.06s)]
*  earlier. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2976.06s)]
*  Is there anything else beyond the spending package and the NDAA that is on the list that [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2977.06s)]
*  the president has for things that he would like the House to accomplish before control [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2983.42s)]
*  turns over to the Republicans in January? [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2989.34s)]
*  Well, we've actually laid that out a couple of times. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2991.7s)]
*  You know, we believe that the president believes that we should get the government funded, [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q8t1u4AAUWg&t=2996.66s)]
