# Biden just REFUSES to say this: Pete Hegseth
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY)
*  Yeah, he was they were shouting questions at him that did he did decided not to take questions [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=0.0s)]
*  Gave a speech here in which he said a few things that were quite beautiful at the beginning. He talked about [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=5.76s)]
*  Having met with the families of people who had lost loved ones and he said that you'll know you're going to make it [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=12.56s)]
*  When you walk by a window and you see something that your loved one would have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=19.64s)]
*  Remarked upon and that a smile will come to your lips before a tear comes to your eye. He talked about [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=24.94s)]
*  Understanding the rage that they feel but that he urged them not to let rage consume you [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=32.34s)]
*  He also went through a long list of the things he's going to be asking Congress for he again reiterated to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=38.22s)]
*  the adversaries of [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=45.3s)]
*  Israel and the United States to not get involved to use the word don't once again [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=47.1s)]
*  He talked about asking for the Red Cross to be allowed to visit the hostages as [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=52.6s)]
*  well as a hundred million dollars in aid request for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=57.6s)]
*  Gaza and the West Bank and he said as I bring in Pete Hegseth co-host of Fox and Friends weekend [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=61.24s)]
*  he said if this aid is stolen by Hamas the aid will and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=66.48s)]
*  He finalized a speech finished a speech by saying that terrorists live in darkness [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=72.04s)]
*  Terrorists will not win freedom will win and that Israel will continue to be a vibrant and Jewish [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=77.19999999999999s)]
*  Democratic nation Pete Hegseth. That was a way for me to sum up the speech, but let's get your reaction to it now [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=84.55999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, good summary I I want to sit here [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=92.44s)]
*  Cheering the good things that Joe Biden said about America's support for Israel and he did say some good things [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=96.96s)]
*  but this entire trip feels like [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  The almost a smothering Anthony Blinken in in the war room for seven hours Joe Biden [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=106.0s)]
*  They're saying we know you're harmed. We know you've been attacked [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=112.62s)]
*  We know terrorists but restrain yourselves don't react too much when you say something like if Hamas [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=115.84s)]
*  diverts or steals aid if [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  It's when that's what they do aid and disability. They control the aid agencies in Gaza Hamas does [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=125.84s)]
*  He's announcing more aid to Gaza and the West Bank [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=134.58s)]
*  You had a conversation with Mark Levin where Iran is now able to sell weapons around the region [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=138.70000000000002s)]
*  He's calling for peace in a two-state solution [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=143.14000000000001s)]
*  I think he's living in the decades previous without the realization of the evidence in front of us [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=145.34s)]
*  that land for peace has brought a terror state to Israel's border and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  Israel has to do something about and they can't by the way [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=156.74s)]
*  Until Joe Biden leaves because if the president United States is there and you open a land war in Gaza [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  It opens up the possibility of other things as well. He also just refuses Dana [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=165.7s)]
*  Refuses to mention the name Iran and you can say nebulously don't and I hope they're saying things behind the scenes [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=171.54s)]
*  But ultimately the message has yet to be received by the Iranian regime the implications of what they've done [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=179.01999999999998s)]
*  So I think this trip is a reflection of the debacle that happened in [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=185.94s)]
*  Afghanistan and the reality that politically he needs to get ahead of it and I like that his instincts are pro-israel [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=190.5s)]
*  But his administration's instincts are not [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=196.78s)]
*  there to play both sides ism and to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=200.14s)]
*  Talk about the Palestinian plight when it was Hamas who targeted elementary schools [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=204.1s)]
*  Specifically and now shoots rockets that hit their own hospitals and want to spin it because it benefits them to have dead civilians [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  whereas Israelis [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=218.68s)]
*  Simply want retribution for what was done to them Pete. We are watching live on screen. We've seen it all morning [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=220.68s)]
*  This is in Beirut and this is in the West Bank. Sorry, and it's not live. Okay, so we have been seeing these protests [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  We've been showing through the morning in Beirut pretty aggressive protests with the Lebanese military [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=232.32s)]
*  Vigorously fighting back and pushing them back away from our embassy [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=239.8s)]
*  American facilities targeted in the Middle East in the last 24 hours include the US embassy in Beirut and the Al-Assad airbase in Iraq [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=243.8s)]
*  I anticipate there will probably be more of that. Have you been thinking on those lines as well? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=251.42s)]
*  Well, there will be more of it because whether we like it or not the world's I mean [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=259.48s)]
*  I remember in Iraq after the bombing of the Al-Aqsa mosque the Golden Mosque that triggered so much of the sectarian violence in Iraq [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=263.34s)]
*  I was there that morning what had happened during the Iraq war and from the mosques [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=268.98s)]
*  We knew quite quickly that it was al-qaeda in Iraq that had perpetuated that tack [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  But from the mosques they blamed the Crusaders and the Jews [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=277.78000000000003s)]
*  Except for the Jews in our units. There are no Jews living in Iraq. This is always the way they blame [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=282.74s)]
*  They blamed the West they blamed the big Satan and the little Satan [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=289.02000000000004s)]
*  So now is not a time for equivocation [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=293.1s)]
*  Now is the time to fortify our embassies now is the time to send clear messages with our ambassadors that if a hair on [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  The head of American is harmed you will pay for that to include you Hezbollah to include you Hamas to include you Iran [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=301.38s)]
*  And that's what Donald Trump did so well not to make this partisan. This is a very different approach [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  He said if you harm the hair on the head of an American you will pay the regime will pay and Qasem Suleimani is proof of it [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=312.70000000000005s)]
*  Instead we've opened up money to Iran. We've opened up negotiation [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=320.0s)]
*  We've allowed them to fund their proxies [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=324.06s)]
*  We've opened it back up and so we've created this an environment of a vacuum where people think they can challenge America without retribution [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=326.5s)]
*  So I'd expect more of this but man [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=333.52s)]
*  I hope our Marines and our security forces there on lockdown doing whatever they need to do to save Americans [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=335.02s)]
*  Just like whatever we need to do to save Americans who are in Gaza right now [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=341.0s)]
*  Pete Hegza, thank you for joining us and I'm sure we'll be seeing you throughout today tomorrow and through the weekend. Thank you [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qN1DLf4p1JY&t=344.62s)]
