# This is the ‘only way’ to stop Iran proxy attacks: Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM)
*  Here to react Fox News senior strategic analyst retired four-star general Jack Keane general. Thanks for being here [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=0.0s)]
*  you know, we've covered the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=6.0s)]
*  Teppid response the couple of times that missiles have been lobbed at locations that were housing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=9.06s)]
*  Weapons or fighters from these Iranian proxies. What should the White House? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=14.02s)]
*  What should the Pentagon do with this mounting number of attacks that seem to not be stopping? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=17.94s)]
*  Yeah, I mean what the Iranians are about here is is the same thing that they started in the early 1980s [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=23.56s)]
*  And that is to drive the United States military presence out of the region [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=29.56s)]
*  And they out and they believe that they actually need that to achieve their strategic objective [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=33.56s)]
*  Which is domination of control of the Middle East region and the other objective they need is to destroy the state of Israel [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=38.56s)]
*  So the fact that the Iranian proxies are attempting to weaken Israel to isolate it politically as you see they get [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=46.56s)]
*  Widespread international condemnation. That's part of the objective that Iranian wants the instrument in that case is Hamas [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=57.56s)]
*  And the other fact that has taken place is to drive us out of the region and have people in the United States question [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=65.56s)]
*  Well, why are our troops even there in Iraq and Syria? Why are they being exposed to these proxies? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=71.56s)]
*  I thought we solved that problem with Isis a number of years ago that that's what they want [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=76.56s)]
*  And some of that obviously is taking place in our country [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=81.56s)]
*  So that's this is all linked and the administration tries to keep it separate and it's just not the case [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=85.56s)]
*  In terms of what should they do you have to recognize that the sources are on [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=92.56s)]
*  And I think the only way you're going to stop the attacks is to take something away from them that they value [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=98.56s)]
*  And for me it would start with the chain. In other words, Iranian proxies are trained in the IRGC training center in Iran [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=105.56s)]
*  In fact, Hamas was there in September some 500 of them doing some kind of segment rehearsals for what we saw on October the 7th [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=114.56s)]
*  And recognizing that this has value to them tell them look at your continue these attacks [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=124.56s)]
*  We're going to put the IRGC at risk their training center their bases and also their headquarters [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=130.56s)]
*  We've had two presidents that have recognized this when you're trying to stop Iranians aggressive behavior [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=139.56s)]
*  One was Ronald Reagan who learned from the early 80s experience where they bombed our barracks and two embassies [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=145.56s)]
*  And we did leave Lebanon. I don't want to relitigate whether we should have shouldn't have been there [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=152.56s)]
*  But then he went after them in the mid 80s because they were taking us on as we were trying to protect and escorting tankers out of the Persian Gulf [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=157.56s)]
*  And he went after their oil platforms and their IRGC Navy bases and guess what? Shut them down [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=167.56s)]
*  Second president came along, President Trump also learned from experience what was really going on here and how much of a threat Iran was into the region [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=174.56s)]
*  And when they went after us sizably he took down the leader of the IRGC could force as we all know Qasem Soleimani [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=184.56s)]
*  Did they attack us as a result of that? They did. But then they shut down because they knew that he would continue to pursue them [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=193.56s)]
*  And in terms of what they truly value, they don't value their proxies. They want them to succeed of course [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=203.56s)]
*  But if they lose weapons, if they lose missiles, if they lose people, they fundamentally don't care that much [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=210.56s)]
*  But what they do care is what I just mentioned [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=216.56s)]
*  It's a fantastic breakdown and so the administration would say well we don't want to escalate and cause a larger war [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=219.56s)]
*  Which a lot of us would agree with but by not hitting them where it matters you're actually lending yourself to more attacks [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=226.56s)]
*  Which creates the environment where it could escalate [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=233.56s)]
*  So it's a tight balance. Nobody knows it better than you. General Jack Keene you broke it down. I appreciate your time this morning [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=236.56s)]
*  Yeah, good talking to Pete. Good talking to you sir [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=243.56s)]
*  Thank you [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yij8bI35lTM&t=256.56s)]
