# US-led raid kills 15 ISIS fighters in early morning raid, US military says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw)
*  For more on that American-led raid on ISIS in Iraq and all of the latest from the Middle East, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=0.0s)]
*  let's bring in Dr. Rebecca Grant, Senior Fellow at the Lexington Institute. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=5.04s)]
*  It seems, Dr. Grant, like we haven't heard a lot from ISIS lately, but this raid was apparently [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=9.76s)]
*  quite successful in that it got some of the top people in ISIS. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=17.2s)]
*  Yes, and the defeat ISIS mission has actually been very active because ISIS attacks in that region [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=22.64s)]
*  around Iraq and Syria have been on the upswing. And John, if you include airstrikes, our U.S. forces [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=28.96s)]
*  with Iraqi and other coalition partners have carried out more than 200 operations just this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=34.64s)]
*  year alone against the ISIS remnants. And General Karila at Central Command, his top priority [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=41.52s)]
*  is hitting the ISIS planners who are trying to prepare for attacks out of the area, beyond Iraq [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  and Syria, at other points on the globe. And so I think they've carried out a very successful [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=55.6s)]
*  strike. Sounds like a very intense airborne operation. Sounds like our folks got shot at [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=60.88s)]
*  a little bit, but they've made a real success in taking out a big ISIS terror planning camp. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=65.44s)]
*  Yes, seven Americans injured, but it does not sound like the injuries were terribly serious. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Should we expect blowback, though, from this American operation? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=77.28s)]
*  Yes. Not blowback. I think this actually is a blow to ISIS. And remember, they will have watched [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=81.6s)]
*  this target, which was a big compound, for a long time. So, short term, they've broken up the ability [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=88.8s)]
*  to supply explosives and fighters for possible operations. And then longer term, this is a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  reminder that the defeat ISIS coalition that ended the caliphate back in 2018 is still very [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  successful, very much in place, and it should strengthen Iraqi security as well. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=108.32s)]
*  What about the nuclear talks that the Biden administration has said it wanted to resume, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=114.39999999999999s)]
*  but it appears that that's not going to happen, at least while Joe Biden is still in office? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=124.8s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. Yes. So, Iran's new president and the Ayatollah gave him permission and sort of said, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=130.4s)]
*  hey, any chance of talking about a nuclear back channel, maybe some more cash? And I have to say, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=138.08s)]
*  I'm so glad the State Department said no way. And the situation has gotten very serious. The UN [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=143.84s)]
*  says that Iran has enriched almost enough uranium to build several bombs. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=152.32000000000002s)]
*  The new president in Iran is a little more moderate. He's going to want to try to get [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=158.72000000000003s)]
*  sanctions relief. And so they're going to be going for this. But hey, remember, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=163.12s)]
*  Iran has two American aircraft carriers and all sorts of other planes and forces [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=167.52s)]
*  staring them down right now. So I'm not surprised that they're asking about talks. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=172.56s)]
*  And I'm so glad the State Department said, forget it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=177.6s)]
*  You say the new president appears to be more moderate, but you don't get to be president [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=180.24s)]
*  in Iran without the blessing of the Ayatollah, do you? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  Oh, correct. And the real issue with the new president is he has a bit of a tricky relationship [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  with the IRGC, the terrorists, Ghani and all that crowd. So they're waiting to see how this [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=193.44s)]
*  is going to shake out. Obviously, the IRGC are not in favor of nuclear talks. But as president, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=200.32s)]
*  he's going to want to get some sanctions relief. So I think we have several more chapters to go. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=206.96s)]
*  The fact is, Iran has just continued to enrich. There's no reason for them to do what they've [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=212.24s)]
*  done. And they put themselves in a very bad spot. We know that Iran was responsible for the deaths [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  of so many U.S. service personnel. Their explosive-formed penetrators did horrific [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=224.72000000000003s)]
*  damage to U.S. troops during the Iraqi war. And it just seems like this administration, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  and maybe previous administrations, have been reluctant to hold Iran's feet to the fire. Why [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=237.6s)]
*  is that? And it's astonishing because Iran, of course, supplied militia units inside Iraq. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=242.56s)]
*  And that's why Soleimani was taken out. He led all that. And that's what caused the deaths of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=251.12s)]
*  over 600 U.S. service members. These were Iranian-supplied militia making attacks in Iraq. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=257.36s)]
*  And that's the model that we now see expanded across the Middle East, whether it's support for [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=263.92s)]
*  Hamas, support for the Houthis. And it is amazing that the administration has been so reluctant to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=269.76s)]
*  hold Iran's feet to the fire on this. Iran really is the head of the snake, the cause of the terror [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=275.6s)]
*  and distress in the Middle East. And I've got to say, they can never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  Let's hope you're right. Dr. Rebecca Grant, thank you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=287.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VlRGcqa-nTw&t=290.88s)]
