**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM)
*  But all this leaker stuff, these leakers are professional stabbers. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=0.0s)]
*  That's what they are. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=3.88s)]
*  They go out and they read this stuff and then they tell you what it says against the law, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=4.8s)]
*  but they characterize it for you in a way that's absolutely false. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=9.76s)]
*  There's no way Iran comes to the table if somehow nothing had happened. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=13.4s)]
*  This was complete and total obliteration. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=16.32s)]
*  They're in bad shape. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  They are way behind today compared to where they were just seven days ago [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=20.2s)]
*  because of what the president did. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxU-XTKsZiM&t=23.080000000000002s)]
