# 'Theatre is set' for Israel strike of Iran, former NSC director warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE)
*  Very positive and constructive. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=0.0s)]
*  That is how the White House is describing Saturday's nuclear talks in Oman with Iranian officials with plans for continued talks at the end of this week. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=3.0s)]
*  Joining me with more on this topic is former Special Assistant to the President and former National Security Council Senior Director Michael Allen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=11.0s)]
*  Always great to have you inside the studio because there's so much that we can sort of unpack here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=19.0s)]
*  Let me begin by sharing a bit from the Defense Secretary, Pete Hexeth. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=24.0s)]
*  He's talking about the need, first and foremost, to prevent the regime from ending up with a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=28.0s)]
*  Here's sound from him. Get your reaction afterwards. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=33.0s)]
*  If we can't figure this out at the negotiating table, then there are other options to include my department to ensure that Iran never has a nuclear bomb. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=37.0s)]
*  We hope we never get there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=44.0s)]
*  Iran's taking a look at what's happening to the Houthis and realizing they don't want any part of it. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=46.0s)]
*  And that's because we've dismantled, we're dismantling the Houthis' capabilities. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=50.0s)]
*  Well, they're certainly doing that. I mean, that's unarguable. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=56.0s)]
*  They are absolutely hammering the Houthis. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=59.0s)]
*  And yet we have been at this position before, Michael, where there's lots of talk, the Iranians lie or they obfuscate. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=61.0s)]
*  Do you expect any progress in this circumstance? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=69.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's going to be really tough because the Iranians, I think, believe that for them to have a nuclear weapon guarantees that the Iranian revolutionary regime would stay in power forever. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=72.0s)]
*  So I think we are going to have to really drive a tough bargain, not just with the maximum pressure sanctions that President Trump has addressed, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=84.0s)]
*  but also the credible threat of some sort of military force, be it Israel, the United States, or both of us pressuring Iran to make real compromises. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=92.0s)]
*  Or else I think they're going to tiptoe right up to having a bomb. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=104.0s)]
*  Here's the question, though. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=107.0s)]
*  Do you really expect that despite what they say, they'll actually follow through? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=109.0s)]
*  I remember with the inspectors, the IAEA, they wouldn't let certain people come in. You couldn't look at this facility. You can't do that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=114.0s)]
*  There seems to be a pattern that I've been watching play out since 1979, or maybe I'm just skeptical because I hear about it the most. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=121.0s)]
*  You're appropriately skeptical. They've cheated so many times. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=128.0s)]
*  There have been underground uranium enrichment facilities that we've found. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=131.0s)]
*  Ultimately, if President Trump goes up with a deal, he's got to be profoundly skeptical throughout the deal itself. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=135.0s)]
*  We've got to have good intelligence. We have to have our allies lined up to be able to watch and stare persistently at the Iranians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=143.0s)]
*  But look, I don't know that the Israelis are going to feel comfortable regardless. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=151.0s)]
*  I think that the theater is set for them to make a strike sometime this year, and honestly, I think that's where it's headed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=156.0s)]
*  Before I share some of the foreign minister from Iran who seemed fairly positive about the way conversations are going, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=163.0s)]
*  can you do me a favor and distinguish the difference between the regime and the Iranian people? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=170.0s)]
*  They're dynamic. They are, for lack of a better description, many of them are frankly freedom-loving, but they're in a very desperate circumstance in that country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=176.0s)]
*  Well, you were right to harken back to 1979. The Persian people have a long, proud civilization, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=185.0s)]
*  and the theocratic, really extreme version of Shia Islam took over in 1979, and that's what's ruled that particular country. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=191.0s)]
*  It's very harsh towards women, human rights, freedom generally, and I think you can see that if they can't keep the economy going, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=203.0s)]
*  the people feel taxed and they feel restless and they really want a change in government. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=211.0s)]
*  And that's exactly why economic pressure as well as the threat of military pressure is so important. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=215.0s)]
*  That said, I do want to give a fair shot here to the foreign minister who seems somewhat encouraged by the way the talks are going in Oman. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=220.0s)]
*  Your reaction to this? Oh, we have a graphic actually. My apologies. Can we share that? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=228.0s)]
*  Here it is. This is actually off of X. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=236.0s)]
*  A constructive and promising round of indirect talks with US Special Envoy Woodcoff, kindly hosted and mediated by my brother. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=238.0s)]
*  The talks were conducted in an atmosphere of mutual respect. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=246.0s)]
*  I elaborated Ron's viewpoints in a firm yet forward-looking manner. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=250.0s)]
*  Both sides decided to continue the process in a matter of days. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=254.0s)]
*  You know, there's that. If nothing else, they're saying that, look, we're happy, we feel respected, we can keep the dialogue going. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=259.0s)]
*  I think that's a win for both sides. I think it's good, but look, we can't let this go on forever. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=265.0s)]
*  We can't let this become a delay mechanism to allow them to continue to study how to weaponize uranium. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=270.0s)]
*  And so we've got to be skeptical. We have to keep this time limited. It's more than just our relationships with the people that show up there. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=277.0s)]
*  It's us recognizing that they may sneak to a bomb or break out and sprint to a bomb, and we've got to be ready. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=284.0s)]
*  Can I ask, and I know this is a little bit complicated, the Obama-Biden regime had a particular approach to sort of slowing down, if you will, their march toward a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=290.0s)]
*  Was that effective? Was it ineffective? Tell me about the difference in the way they handled things versus the way the Trump administration helps to handle things. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=303.0s)]
*  Well, we're going into a maximum pressure phase, but Trump seems like he is interested in a deal. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=310.0s)]
*  But he appropriately was skeptical of the Obama deal, which put time limits, but we don't want just time limits on their ability to build a nuclear bomb. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=315.0s)]
*  We want it to be in perpetuity, in effect, and we want them to not be able to perfect their enrichment. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=325.0s)]
*  We want them to be shut down, and you mentioned the IAEA inspectors. They have to be given unfettered access across the country. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=332.0s)]
*  That hasn't happened in years, and that is going to be part and parcel of any trust that would go into a future agreement. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=339.0s)]
*  You nailed it. If that doesn't happen, this is where I think the SEC-DEF, the Defense Secretary is right. All options are on the table, and rightly so. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=346.0s)]
*  Michael Allen, real pleasure to see you, my friend. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=355.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ok6RP2LLRLE&t=357.0s)]
