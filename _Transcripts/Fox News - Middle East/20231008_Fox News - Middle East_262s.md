# ‘SPOILER’: Iran wants to foil a deal with Saudi Arabia, expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc)
*  close. Every day we get closer. It seems it's for the first time. Uh, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=0.0s)]
*  real one serious. I know you heard those words from the Saudi Crown [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=8.58s)]
*  Prince. What was your response? Well, I was delighted to hear what he had to [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=12.06s)]
*  say and to to borrow phrase. I think we're getting closer to peace every [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=16.1s)]
*  day that passes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=22.1s)]
*  A Fox News alert barely two weeks ago, both the Saudi Crown Prince and [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister were on the brink of a historic peace deal, which [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=28.4s)]
*  many now fear won't happen as Hamas terrorists attack Israel. Former IDF [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=32.44s)]
*  paratrooper Daniel Flesh served as spokesperson at Israel's mission to the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=37.84s)]
*  U. N. And he joins us now. Daniel, thanks for being with us. I'm just [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=43.28s)]
*  curious as you join us this morning, where is your sentiment on that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=46.68s)]
*  previously optimistic viewpoint that Saudi Arabian Israel might be arriving [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=51.32s)]
*  at peace? Do you feel that optimism still today? Well, I think this morning [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=55.56s)]
*  it's perhaps on hold at worst. Certainly Israel's focus right now is [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=60.56s)]
*  securing its southern communities, securing its border, pushing Hamas [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=65.48s)]
*  terrorists back into Gaza. As President Netanyahu stated yesterday, bringing [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  the fight into Gaza and making sure that all Israeli civilians or soldiers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=72.94s)]
*  that have been brought into Gaza as captives yesterday are returned [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=76.46000000000001s)]
*  safely home. So in terms of peace with Saudi Arabia, that's certainly a [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=80.54s)]
*  long term strategic objective. Right now, it's just focused on making sure that [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=84.4s)]
*  it secures its own country. But you and I both know it's also somehow intricately [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  tied up in what just happened in Israel. There is the belief out there that, of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=91.72s)]
*  course, Iran is behind what Hamas just executed in southern Israel. And Iran [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=96.12s)]
*  wants to interfere with a potential peace deal between Israel and Saudi [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=101.72s)]
*  Arabia. So there is a belief that if you can sow chaos, provoke a response from [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  Israel, an overwhelming response from Israel, that you can then somehow get [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=111.72s)]
*  Saudi Arabia separated from Israel. How do you see that? A, do you [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=116.56s)]
*  believe that's the strategy from Iran? And B, will it be successful? Well, I think [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=122.32s)]
*  you have to ask why this attack occurred yesterday. There's a number of reasons [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=126.84s)]
*  you could posture, but one of the main ones is because, as you showed in the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=129.8s)]
*  clip a little before, that normalization efforts between Saudi Arabia and Israel, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=133.5s)]
*  as the interview with Brett Baer showed from the UN General Assembly week, have [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=137.68s)]
*  been progressing very positively. So why now? Iran's trying to play a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=141.08s)]
*  spoiler to that potential normalization agreement, because if there's a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=145.36s)]
*  normalization agreement, that effectively ends the 70-plus Arab-Israeli War, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=148.56s)]
*  really the Arab War on Israel. So Iran has clearly activated its Hamas cat's [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  paw in Gaza Strip. We're hearing already today that there's activity in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=158.56s)]
*  Lebanon's southern border with Hezbollah, another Iran-sponsored terrorist [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  organization. So certainly I think it's clear that Iran hadn't feel bolstered [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=166.68s)]
*  from a lot of the policies coming from this administration the last number of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=170.36s)]
*  months, getting money for hostage exchanges and other measures [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  have been taken. It's feeling emboldened. It wants to probably try to [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=179.0s)]
*  interrupt or intercept any sort of operation that's or agreement that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=183.56s)]
*  Israel and Saudi Arabia could have. And in that estimation, is the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  strategic purpose then to provoke Israel into something that would somehow then [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=194.28000000000003s)]
*  turn off Saudi Arabia? A response from Israel that would make Saudi Arabia go, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=199.32s)]
*  whoa, that's too much Israel? I think certainly, because Saudi Arabia is the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  custodians of the two holy cities of the mosque, and it's viewed itself as [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=208.84s)]
*  obviously the bulwark of the Arab world, particularly against Israel for the last [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=212.32s)]
*  seven-plus decades. So if you're able to try to cleave them apart and try to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=216.28s)]
*  have Hamas become the new front against Israel, certainly Saudi Arabia will look [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=222.6s)]
*  at that and if Israel is taking the fight to other to other Muslims, to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=228.88s)]
*  Palestinians, to what extent can Saudi Arabia then be a party to Israel? But [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=232.64s)]
*  again, I think the broader strategic position for Saudi Arabia is then to [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=237.12s)]
*  have peace with Israel, but right now it's just focused on its own security [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=242.16s)]
*  concerns. I gotta run there. Thank you so much. It puts Bibi Netanyahu in a very [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=246.07999999999998s)]
*  difficult position. Thank you, Daniel. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpKHDA9zBHc&t=249.68s)]
