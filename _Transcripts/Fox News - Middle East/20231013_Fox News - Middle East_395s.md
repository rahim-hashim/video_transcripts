# Lawrence Jones confronts young anti-Israel protesters over Hamas terror
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww)
*  We're back with the Fox News alert. Major U. S. Cities on high alert today as a former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas leader declares today a global day of jihad urging protesters to join the war against [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=5.98s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=12.780000000000001s)]
*  So police from Los Angeles to New York City are stepping up security as the FBI urges [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=13.780000000000001s)]
*  the public to be vigilant. Great. I love when they tell us that as more mass protests are [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  planned across the nation. So here we go. We they said 36,000 NYPD officers get in uniform. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=22.22s)]
*  I don't want to hear any excuses. You got a vacation plan. You're not going right. Come [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=29.54s)]
*  back. We should have 39,000. That's another story. I love that. I think that these are [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=33.46s)]
*  the men and women that that protect us and whoever's in charge, I guess it's the commissioner [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=37.78s)]
*  that saying this. I love that that he or she is saying who's our commissioner now is saying [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=42.1s)]
*  you have to come back to work. Yeah, which is happening. Happening for good reason. When [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  you look at these rallies and protests that occurred in Lawrence, you got a chance to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  see it. I mean, it's it's I've covered a lot of rallies, a lot of protests. I was all [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=54.66s)]
*  out of the street when the summer love 2020. This is the worst I've ever seen. And it's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=60.059999999999995s)]
*  it is the chance that we have gone from no justice, no peace to open jihad. This is some [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=65.5s)]
*  of the comments we found yesterday. Where'd you go? You went to Hunter Hunter College. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=71.38s)]
*  Why are you here today? Free Palestine. I stand with the Palestinian people unequivocally. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=84.66s)]
*  I support decolonization and liberation of Palestinian people in the end of a mass genocide [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=91.14s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip. Talking about the genocide of the kids being beheaded. That's false. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=96.46s)]
*  That is actually false. When you see the kids that have been beheaded and the women that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=100.66s)]
*  are raped, how do you feel about that? I don't know where to start from that. Israel is notorious [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=105.52s)]
*  for creating propaganda that sides their one sided massacre against Palestinians. That [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=112.97999999999999s)]
*  was already proven that didn't really happen. There was not verified. Women did not get [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=118.38s)]
*  raped. No, I have. I've not seen any proof of that. If it did happen, it I haven't seen [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=124.05999999999999s)]
*  it like they get attacked for no reason. The children got attacked for no reason. The kids [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=131.14s)]
*  that were beheaded, beheaded. Yeah, apparently like that's what they were. Jewish kids with [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=136.01999999999998s)]
*  Jewish guns. The U.S. military money that goes there, four billion dollars a year, should [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=141.5s)]
*  stop going to Israel to support their war crimes. So there's two things that happened [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=146.82s)]
*  there. You have the kids that were there that were indoctrinated, that were clueless to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=152.7s)]
*  what was going on there. And then you have the other kids that were there that had masks, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=157.42s)]
*  that looked like jihadists, that looked like straight up jihadists because they didn't [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=161.82s)]
*  want their identity to be shown there. And they were openly spewing rhetoric that her [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=165.78s)]
*  mom is saying, Pete. And I have this conversation with you off air. The question is, are these [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=173.14000000000001s)]
*  people a risk to America now that are spewing this type of nonsense? Well, I think if you're [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=180.46s)]
*  looking at what cities are doing across America today, clearly our authorities think they [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=186.74s)]
*  are. By the way, the word jihad. Look at the size of that crab. That's a Columbia. Different [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=190.82s)]
*  school. Columbia, Hunter, NYU. But this is the way our foreign policy departments, history [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=195.42s)]
*  departments and others in universities are aligned. They're aligned against America, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=202.1s)]
*  against Israel, anti-Zionist, anti-Jewish, pro-Palestinian, pro-Arab, pro-decolonization, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=206.45999999999998s)]
*  which means basically code for getting rid of anything Judeo-Christian, anything of Western [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=214.29999999999998s)]
*  civilization. And they'll say that, well, jihad can mean anything. There's violent jihad [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=219.54s)]
*  and then there's inner resistance or jihad, cultural jihad. It might even be a breakfast [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=224.5s)]
*  cereal. With whatever you want it to be. You know what I noticed about the people that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=229.3s)]
*  you talked to? You had that one lady with the mask who is a denier. She doesn't believe [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=233.22s)]
*  that anything that we've been reporting on is happening. These women that are crying, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=239.1s)]
*  saying my child was taken from the music festival and we can't find her. The dad who says that, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=243.82s)]
*  she just believes they're standing in front of the camera and they're actors and they're [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=249.18s)]
*  getting paid to say this. And then you have the guy who you were saying, what about the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=252.06s)]
*  women or what about the babies that were beheaded? And it sounded like he didn't know about that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=256.78000000000003s)]
*  He's so confused. He's there protesting but doesn't know the information. Lightly educated. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  They didn't do any research. I would love to see her show up with pictures. Hey, I just [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=266.58s)]
*  want to take a look at my phone. Is this fictitious? These actors? We've seen on other campuses [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=271.02s)]
*  though, Palestinian activists ripping those posters off the wall and saying it's not true. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=275.98s)]
*  It's an alternate universe. I just want to clarify when you see the people with the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=281.38s)]
*  mask, the N95 mask, they're not wearing the mask for COVID. They were passing these out [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=285.18s)]
*  at the event to conceal people's identity because there's been some companies now saying, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=290.86s)]
*  you know what, if we find out that you're a part of this hateful rhetoric, we're not [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=296.68s)]
*  going to hire you. So there's an effort to cover their faces both with other masks that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=300.7s)]
*  obviously there and also the scarves that they're using to cover themselves. We also [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=308.18s)]
*  talk with, I'm sorry, go ahead. We also talk with some of the Jewish students there on [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=313.54s)]
*  campus. This is what one had to say. People are definitely scared. And for honestly, you [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=318.42s)]
*  could say it's for good reason when your classmates are calling for you to be killed and supporting [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=325.9s)]
*  the raping of women and the capture of Holocaust survivors and the beheading of children and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=331.74s)]
*  just of people. So Pete, that was when the police gave them the flag back because one [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=343.82s)]
*  of the Hamas protesters took the flag away, assaulted one of the girls and they had to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=351.94s)]
*  arrest them. Because under the doctrine of Hamas, killing a Jew leads to glory. Right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=356.06s)]
*  And so these groups are ultimately protesting for mass genocide. If they got what they wanted, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=362.09999999999997s)]
*  it would be mass genocide of Jews. Their God teaches them to do this? Well, their interpretation [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=367.78s)]
*  of the Quran and the Hadith inside Islam justifies violence against infidels, which includes [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=373.46s)]
*  any Jew, any Christian, anyone who does not believe. Non-believer. There you go. 52 minutes [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=378.58s)]
*  after the top of the hour, heavy conversations. It's hard to, I mean, that boy you talk to, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=384.34s)]
*  you could tell he, it's just too much. Everything they're doing to innocent people. It's so [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=389.86s)]
*  much. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwTMf79eMww&t=394.06s)]
