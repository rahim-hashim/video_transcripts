# Iran issues warning to US after Israel attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8)
*  Welcome back to Sunday Night in America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=0.0s)]
*  While the missiles and drones were still in midair last night, Iran made a point to say [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=4.0s)]
*  the attack was revenge for the IDF strike in Syria that killed their top generals, that [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=8.24s)]
*  the matter was, quote, concluded in their minds. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=14.44s)]
*  But Iran has been provoking conflict in the region for decades, so it did not start and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=18.1s)]
*  will not likely end with the events of last night. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=22.98s)]
*  What is Iran trying to signal, and what should we make of Iran warning the U.S. to stay [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=27.0s)]
*  away? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=32.36s)]
*  The exiled Iranian Crown Prince, His Royal Highness Reza Pahlavi joins us now. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=33.6s)]
*  Welcome, Your Highness. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  What did you make of the Iranian response last night, and what do you think was meant [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=40.64s)]
*  by the matter has been concluded? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=45.8s)]
*  Well, Trey, these are signs of the regime becoming more weak and desperate. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=48.28s)]
*  And as a matter of fact, at the very same time that it launched its missiles and drones [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=54.24s)]
*  against Israel, it has cracked down yet again on Iranian women on the streets of Iran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=58.84s)]
*  The Ministry of the Intelligence, part of the SEPA or the IRGC, has warned people in Iran [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=64.60000000000001s)]
*  that the slightest demonstration of sentiment and sympathy to the Israelis would be harshly [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=73.12s)]
*  treated. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=79.52000000000001s)]
*  We are extremely afraid of what the Iranian people think, and as a result, it's only [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=80.72s)]
*  indicating that, as we have always believed, the regime is trying to hang on to power by [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  intimidation and repression at home and exercising through its proxies, or this time directly [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=89.96s)]
*  by itself, its conflict abroad. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  Sir, if my memory serves me correctly, you visited Israel, and you believe the Iranian [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=97.84s)]
*  people and the Israeli people can coexist in peace. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=105.08s)]
*  What will it take to make that happen? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=110.52000000000001s)]
*  Well, from Tehran to Tel Aviv, from Hamadan to Haifa, Iranians and Israelis know that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=113.08s)]
*  this is not the Iranian people's war. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=121.44s)]
*  This is Ali Khamenei, the dictator of this brutal regime's war. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=123.28s)]
*  As we speak, Trey, today there were demonstrations in Paris, in London, in Berlin. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=128.32s)]
*  Iranians, together with Israelis and Jews, hand in hand together, supporting each other [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=134.6s)]
*  and demonstrating to the whole world that we as a nation and Israel as a nation have [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=142.12s)]
*  our destiny intertwined. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=148.44s)]
*  We cannot hope for any chance for peace and stability in the region until this regime [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=151.28s)]
*  is finally gone. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=157.04s)]
*  I think it's important for the world to realize that the only obstacle to peace and [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=158.64s)]
*  stability and a better future lies on putting an end to this regime. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=163.0s)]
*  It is time for the world to finally decide to endorse and back the Iranian people to [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=167.44s)]
*  topple this regime and put an end to all this madness. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=172.92s)]
*  You know, you mentioned regime change. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=177.4s)]
*  Many of us found it stunning that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer called for regime change [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=180.0s)]
*  in Israel, but they've been pretty silent on regime change in Iran. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=184.6s)]
*  What can or should the U.S. do to support the Iranian people to have a different government, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=190.64s)]
*  a government that doesn't do the things that you just described, especially to women? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=196.76s)]
*  Well, look, when you release money to a regime and give it more means to finance its proxies [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=201.2s)]
*  and use brutality at home, basically, appeasement has proven that it only emboldens the regime. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=208.76s)]
*  We said that a long time ago. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=216.12s)]
*  In fact, as you indicated last year when I visited Israel, part of our discussions with [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=217.6s)]
*  Israeli leaders, and for that matter other leaders around the world, has been precisely [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=223.88s)]
*  this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=228.76s)]
*  If you let the regime be emboldened by the fact that they can count on appeasement or [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=229.76s)]
*  paying ransom for the release of hostages or not imposing all sanctions, which gave [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=234.08s)]
*  the regime almost an extra $100 billion, the fact that the current administration is trying [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=239.2s)]
*  to release even yet more money to the regime, about $10 billion of Iranian electricity revenue [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  from the Iraqis, what do you think is going to happen next? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=251.32000000000002s)]
*  I think there's a direct correlation between appeasement and doing these kind of things [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=253.88s)]
*  and the regime becoming emboldened. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=258.64s)]
*  The solution, again, is to use every opportunity to put more pressure on the regime. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=261.04s)]
*  For instance, it is time that the United States allies in Europe finally decides to put the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=265.32s)]
*  on the terrorist group list, and that would mean more pressure on the regime. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=271.64s)]
*  But also parallel to that, it is time to use maximum support to the Iranian people in their [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=275.6s)]
*  struggle against this regime. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=281.56s)]
*  It is the Iranian people's ask to have change. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=283.2s)]
*  It doesn't have to be a U.S. senator saying who needs to change. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=285.96s)]
*  If the Iranian people are saying loud and clear, we are done with this regime, help [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=289.2s)]
*  us liberate ourselves, that's the message that the Iranian people have to the entire [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=293.16s)]
*  world. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=297.12s)]
*  I hope that the U.S. government and other governments will heed this call and finally [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=298.12s)]
*  help us save our world from disaster and more conflict and have an opportunity post this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=303.68s)]
*  regime to have regional peace and brotherly cooperation, not just Iran and Israel, but [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=309.96s)]
*  the Arab world too that has also been a target of this regime. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=316.4s)]
*  Your Royal Highness, thank you for joining us on a Sunday night and loaning us your truly [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=322.8s)]
*  unique perspective on Iran. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=327.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=329.88s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Bx_sK38NM8&t=330.88s)]
