# IDF withdrawal from southern Gaza a tactical decision, Dem sen presumes
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA)
*  Joining me now, Delaware Senator and the Biden campaign's national co-chair, Chris Coons, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=0.0s)]
*  from the Biden campaign headquarters in Wilmington. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=5.28s)]
*  Senator, thank you very much for being here this morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=8.56s)]
*  You hear these reports that we just heard from Lucas Tomlinson and Trey Yanks that Israeli [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=12.16s)]
*  IDF forces pulling out except for one brigade. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=17.64s)]
*  What is your reaction to this very big development on the ground in Gaza? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=21.82s)]
*  Well, Martha, first it's important to remember how this all began six months ago with a brutal, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=26.84s)]
*  a barbaric attack by Hamas terrorists who massacred roughly 1,200 Israelis. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=31.72s)]
*  And in the six months of this campaign against Hamas in Gaza, thousands and thousands of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=37.36s)]
*  IDF troops have done their best to carry out a campaign to eliminate Hamas from Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=41.88s)]
*  There will still be several thousand IDF troops, that's what a brigade is, in Gaza after this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=47.68s)]
*  announcement this morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=53.04s)]
*  But I presume this is a tactical decision by the IDF and Israeli leadership in the face [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=54.56s)]
*  of a threat of a real attack from the north, from Hezbollah, or a direct attack from Iran. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=59.9s)]
*  And it's important for all of us who support Israel to be clear that we will continue to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=65.66s)]
*  defend Israel against Iran or any of its proxies in the region. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=70.44s)]
*  So you see this as a tactical regrouping, not as the end of the war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=75.52s)]
*  Is this the ceasefire that President Biden clearly laid down his request for? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=81.08s)]
*  He said, we will not support you if we don't see changes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=86.4s)]
*  Are these those changes or not? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=90.64s)]
*  Well, I wasn't in that conversation between President Biden and Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  but there are negotiations in Cairo today about a possible hostage release and ceasefire. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=98.44s)]
*  As you know, Martha, thousands and thousands of Israelis have been protesting in Tel Aviv [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=104.36s)]
*  and throughout the country about the lack of progress on a release of the hostages. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  You'll be hearing from a hostage, someone who's been released soon. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=114.4s)]
*  I've met many times with hostage families. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=117.88000000000001s)]
*  It is tragic that Hamas continues to use civilians as human shields, continues to hold these [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  hostages and continues to terrorize them now for 184 days. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  So it's my hope that the changes that were asked for, the delivery of humanitarian aid, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=132.08s)]
*  the de-confliction of possible strikes into Gaza with where humanitarian aid's being delivered [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=137.64s)]
*  and a conduct of the future campaign against Rafa to finish the job against Hamas in a [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=144.04s)]
*  way that will minimize civilian casualties. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  I'm hopeful that we're going to see all of those changes unfolding here in the days ahead. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  So why wasn't, why didn't President Biden make it contingent that if you bring about [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=156.04s)]
*  a ceasefire, it will be in return for hostages? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=162.56s)]
*  Those ceasefire until the hostages were returned, are returned completely, has always been Netanyahu's goal. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=165.96s)]
*  So it looks like we're seeing it in reverse and just hoping that it will result in the [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=173.76000000000002s)]
*  release of hostages, Senator. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=178.96s)]
*  Martha, I think we're mischaracterizing what's going on. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=181.08s)]
*  There will still be thousands of IDF soldiers in the south of Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=184.48000000000002s)]
*  I have not heard President Biden call for a ceasefire without the release of hostages. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=188.28s)]
*  I think that is the direction that all of us are pressing for. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=193.1s)]
*  And I'll remind you that President Biden has repeatedly pushed Qatar and Egypt, who have [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=197.42000000000002s)]
*  direct communications with Hamas, to press Hamas harder to release the hostages they [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=203.04s)]
*  are holding. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=208.3s)]
*  I think that's what all of us have been hoping for. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=209.3s)]
*  In my last meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu in Israel, that's what I was encouraging, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=211.98000000000002s)]
*  was continued negotiations. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  And I've also directly communicated with Egyptian and Qatari leaders on the urgency of a hostage [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=218.66s)]
*  release as a condition for any ceasefire. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=224.54s)]
*  So I just want to remind our viewers of the sentiment of protesters. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=227.74s)]
*  This is from a few months ago. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=232.62s)]
*  There were a lot of student protesters. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=234.44s)]
*  We continue to see them all the time against the U.S. policy in support of Israel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=235.9s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=241.3s)]
*  You have a whole generation of voters coming up who are going to be able to vote in this [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=242.3s)]
*  next election. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=249.06s)]
*  And if you don't stop this genocide now, you will not get these votes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=250.06s)]
*  So we saw hundreds of thousands of vote uncommitted against essentially President Biden. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  We've heard for quite a while about the tensions that exist within the White House. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  The president initially said he was rock solid in support of Israel's efforts here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=266.42s)]
*  Have the protesters won at the White House? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=272.7s)]
*  No, let me remind you what just happened. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=276.58000000000004s)]
*  Two weeks ago, President Biden signed into law our annual appropriations bill that includes [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=279.34000000000003s)]
*  $3.8 billion in support for Israel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=285.06s)]
*  I think this is a tactical disagreement that began with Prime Minister Netanyahu insisting [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=289.1s)]
*  he would go into Rafa. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=293.90000000000003s)]
*  Let me remind you, in Rafa there's more than a million Palestinian civilians who have fled [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=295.86s)]
*  from the north and the center of Gaza. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=301.26s)]
*  They are now trapped up against the hard border with Egypt. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=303.82s)]
*  And what I have been saying and what I believe President Biden has been saying directly to [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=307.26s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu is before you go in at scale and try to finish the job against [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=311.34s)]
*  Hamas, make sure that you allow for humanitarian aid and for those civilians trapped in Rafa [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=317.14s)]
*  to move out of the way before you conduct this last stage of the ground campaign. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=323.36s)]
*  That's what I understand the disagreement to be about. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=327.96000000000004s)]
*  I want to ask you a quick question about Ukraine. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=331.08000000000004s)]
*  But first I want to ask you this. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=334.68s)]
*  What do you say to those who say that this move is going to be music to the ears for [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=336.6s)]
*  Hamas and for Iran and that their ultimate goal of eradicating Israel from the Middle [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=341.44s)]
*  East if they see the United States pressuring Israel to pull back will be exactly what they [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=347.92s)]
*  want? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=353.92s)]
*  Well, let's move on to the supplemental, which helps answer that question. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=354.92s)]
*  The Senate, controlled by Democrats, passed with a big bipartisan margin, a supplemental [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=360.12s)]
*  that President Biden requested that includes aid for Ukraine, humanitarian aid and 14 billion [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=365.24s)]
*  in additional support for Israel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=372.04s)]
*  It's been waiting for action by the House for weeks now, and it's my hope that Speaker [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=374.64s)]
*  Johnson will put it on the floor this week. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=378.96s)]
*  It will show Iran strong bipartisan determination to continue to support Israel in the face [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=381.68s)]
*  of Iran's threats if that supplemental passes the House this week. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=387.91999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=392.15999999999997s)]
*  I'm just going to ask you one more question on this, and that is do you believe that there [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=393.15999999999997s)]
*  is an imminent strike coming from Iran in retaliation for the killing of two top commanders [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=395.84s)]
*  in the Iranian forces? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=403.4s)]
*  Well, what has been publicly released by our government is a concern that there is a likelihood [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=406.4s)]
*  of an Iranian strike. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=412.84s)]
*  I can't get into classified material, but I think it's important that we continue to [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=414.35999999999996s)]
*  show strong support for the defense of Israel, that we continue to support the Iron Dome [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=419.12s)]
*  and other ballistic missile defenses that we've jointly developed, and that we make [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=424.91999999999996s)]
*  it clear we will defend Israel against any Iranian proxy attack or any direct attack [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=429.40000000000003s)]
*  by Iran. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you one quick question before you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=436.08000000000004s)]
*  Thirty-three members of the House, including Nancy Pelosi, wrote a letter saying that they [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=437.08000000000004s)]
*  wanted to rescind even the current weapons delivery to Israel. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=440.88s)]
*  What do you say to them? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=445.72s)]
*  Look, in the face of a possible attack from Iran, I don't agree that we should in any [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=447.48s)]
*  way constrain or stop the delivery of defensive material that is essential for Israel's defense. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=452.8s)]
*  All right. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=459.08000000000004s)]
*  We will see where the U.S. support of Israel goes in the wake of all of these developments. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=460.08000000000004s)]
*  Senator Coons, thank you very much. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Good to have you here this morning. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0_5BW1t3dA&t=465.76000000000005s)]
