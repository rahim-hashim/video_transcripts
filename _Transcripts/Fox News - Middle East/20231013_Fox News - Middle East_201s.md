# Professor sparks outrage by offering extra credit to attend a Palestinian solidarity event: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI)
*  Professor University of Virginia is getting some attention. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=0.0s)]
*  She appeared to offer students extra credit [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=3.3000000000000003s)]
*  if they attend an event where they [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=5.96s)]
*  could learn how to, quote, stand in solidarity [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=8.44s)]
*  with Palestinians resisting occupation. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=11.16s)]
*  That's a lot. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=14.44s)]
*  Shannon Breams, Anchor of Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Shannon, how you doing? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=16.88s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=17.72s)]
*  First, let's get to the story. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=18.6s)]
*  What happened here at UVA and what was offered? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=19.88s)]
*  Yeah, so somebody sent this along to me from internally [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=24.2s)]
*  at campus and said, listen, there's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=26.96s)]
*  a professor here that seems to be offering extra credit [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=28.4s)]
*  to go to this event. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=31.56s)]
*  Now, what the event is, that's where the questions begin. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=33.76s)]
*  Is it simply about going to stand in solidarity [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=36.8s)]
*  with the Palestinian people? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=39.0s)]
*  As we keep talking about, they are separate from Hamas. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=40.32s)]
*  Most of them want nothing to do with Hamas. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=43.08s)]
*  Hamas does not speak for them. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=44.92s)]
*  Or is it something different, like many of these campus [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=47.12s)]
*  events that we've seen, that do devolve [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=49.72s)]
*  into those kinds of things? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=51.72s)]
*  So we couldn't get confirmation on this, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=53.68s)]
*  but we do know this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=55.84s)]
*  The Virginia Attorney General's office is looking into it [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=56.92s)]
*  and said they want to know exactly what's going on there [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  and whether credit for a class at a university like UVA [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  would be tied to encouraging students [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=65.24000000000001s)]
*  to engage in one of these things that, in some ways, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  has devolved into very ugly protests on some campuses. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=70.44s)]
*  The attorney general there in Virginia, Jason Meares, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=73.84s)]
*  wrote a letter. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  He said that groups like Students [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=77.16s)]
*  for Justice in Palestine have publicly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=78.68s)]
*  stated that they plan Day of Resistance demonstrations [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=80.48s)]
*  this week. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=83.12s)]
*  This pro-Hamas group is using language [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=83.88s)]
*  that suggests advocacy or threats of violence, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=85.76s)]
*  such as calling for physical confrontation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=88.36s)]
*  or dismantling Zionism on campus. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=90.28s)]
*  This is not just a concern in Virginia. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=92.48s)]
*  All across the country, Shannon, you [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=94.28s)]
*  have the government leaders there in those states [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=96.2s)]
*  and at the universities, in most cases, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=100.12s)]
*  trying to figure out a way to protect students, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=103.04s)]
*  let them have their ability to have free speech, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=105.80000000000001s)]
*  but to not do it in a way that sparks any sort of violence. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=109.44s)]
*  Yeah, and that's a beautiful thing about this country, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=112.48s)]
*  we do have a protection of free speech. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=114.72s)]
*  And of course, we know the First Amendment [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  isn't around for speech that everybody loves [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=118.03999999999999s)]
*  and makes everybody happy and we all agree on. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=120.16s)]
*  It's there for very divisive topics. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=122.28s)]
*  We've got a guest on the show this weekend. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=124.56s)]
*  Ben Sasse used to be a senator. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=126.28s)]
*  He's now the head of the University of Florida system, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=127.72s)]
*  who put out a letter that is unequivocal, saying, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=130.24s)]
*  it shouldn't be hard for university presidents [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=132.8s)]
*  to come out and speak against what Hamas has just done. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=134.92s)]
*  And he spoke very eloquently at a vigil there on campus [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=137.88s)]
*  and said, I'm going to protect our Jewish students. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=140.72s)]
*  They should never have to feel unsafe, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=142.95999999999998s)]
*  but I'm also going to protect the right of anybody [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=144.76s)]
*  who has something to say to come and protest here. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  But he thinks it shouldn't be as hard to be morally clear [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  on exactly what's gone on in this particular war, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=152.32s)]
*  these attacks, and he's calling on other college presidents [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  to just be more clear. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=158.04s)]
*  We'll look forward to that. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=159.88s)]
*  Also, you got Tom Cotton on over the weekend on your show [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=160.76s)]
*  and what else you cooking up there, Shannon? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=163.27999999999997s)]
*  We do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=165.48s)]
*  Well, listen, we're going to look at what's happening [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=166.32s)]
*  across the world, of course, and talk about [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  where we go on things like Ukraine funding. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  If you want to move more Israel funding, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=172.79999999999998s)]
*  you guys know very well we need a Speaker of the House [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=174.51999999999998s)]
*  to do that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=176.72s)]
*  We don't have one yet. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=177.56s)]
*  They are meeting now. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=178.38s)]
*  Did they make any progress on that front? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=179.48s)]
*  So we'll talk about how all of those things tie together. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=180.84s)]
*  We do expect someone from the White House, too, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=182.92s)]
*  should be able to confirm that name shortly. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=184.51999999999998s)]
*  Okay, we'll be looking forward to that, Shannon. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=187.88s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=188.72s)]
*  We'll be watching. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=189.54s)]
*  Thanks, guys. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EOI-o4BqPiI&t=190.38s)]
