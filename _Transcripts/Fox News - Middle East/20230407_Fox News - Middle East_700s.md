# This is a ‘vile cocktail of incompetence and dishonesty’: Dagen McDowell
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ)
*  Hello everyone, this is Outnumbered. I'm Emily Campagno here with Dagan McDowell, co-host of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=0.0s)]
*  The Bottom Line on Fox Business, Molly Line, Fox News correspondent, Tommy Lahren, host of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=5.68s)]
*  Tommy Lahren is Fearless on Outkick and Fox News contributor, and Jeremy Hunt, Veterans on Duty [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=12.24s)]
*  chairman, Army veteran, West Point graduate, and former congressional candidate. Now we begin with [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=18.56s)]
*  the newly released assessment of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. The Biden administration's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=24.88s)]
*  review mostly gives the president a free pass while shifting blame to his predecessor. National [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=30.4s)]
*  Security Council spokesman John Kirby defended the Biden administration's action in a heated [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=36.4s)]
*  exchange with reporters yesterday. Watch. In reading this, does the president have any [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=41.28s)]
*  regrets about how this withdrawal was carried out? The president is very proud of the manner in which [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  the men and women of the military, the foreign service, the intelligence community, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=53.36s)]
*  went on and on and on, conducted this withdrawal. Who's going to get fired over this? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=56.48s)]
*  Peter, the purpose of the document that we're putting out today is to sort of collate the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=65.52s)]
*  chief reviews and findings of the agencies that did after action reviews. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=73.12s)]
*  Um, the purpose of it is not accountability. And you're saying that you guys are proud of the way [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=79.2s)]
*  that this mission was conducted? Proud of the fact that we got more than 124,000 people safely out [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=87.44s)]
*  of Afghanistan? You bet. Nobody's saying that everything was perfect, but there was a lot that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  went right, and a lot of Afghans are now living better lives in this country and other countries [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=99.36s)]
*  around the world because of the sacrifices and the work of so many American government officials. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=104.4s)]
*  Specifically, how does the, how is the Trump administration responsible for the disorganized [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=109.84s)]
*  and chaotic process of evacuation and determining who gets to board these evacuation flights? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  And so for all this talk of chaos, I just didn't see it. Not from my perch. At one point during [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=123.76s)]
*  the evacuation, there was an aircraft taking off full of people, Americans and Afghans alike, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=128.8s)]
*  every 48 minutes and not one single mission was missed. So I'm sorry. I just won't buy the whole [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=134.16s)]
*  argument of chaos. Well, we saw the chaos unfolding right before our eyes. We saw horrific scenes of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=139.44s)]
*  people clinging to the side of a plane and tragic scenes of Afghans falling from the sky. We saw [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  heartbreaking images of babies being tossed over razor wire and the Taliban shooting people in the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=155.76s)]
*  streets. We saw the explosion of the suicide bomber who killed hundreds of civilians and 13 [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=162.08s)]
*  U.S. service members. And we heard the emotional and graphic testimony from a Marine who lived [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  through it. Then a flash and a massive wave of pressure. I'm thrown 12 feet onto the ground, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=176.8s)]
*  but instantly knew what had happened. I opened my eyes to Marines dead or unconscious lying around [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  me. My abdomen had been ripped open. Every inch of my exposed body except for my face took ball [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=189.04s)]
*  bearings and shrapnel. I tried to get up but could not. Lying there for a few minutes, I started to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=194.16s)]
*  lose consciousness. When I heard Chaz, my team leader, screaming my name as he ran to me, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=201.84s)]
*  his voice, his voice calling to me kept me awake. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=208.95999999999998s)]
*  Jeremy, what are your thoughts both as a veteran, as a congressional candidate, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=213.12s)]
*  and as a civilian now? Yeah, I mean, well first let me just say this. The gas lighting is just [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=220.4s)]
*  ridiculous. I mean, we have a spokesperson who, by the way, is a retired admiral, John Kirby, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=226.16s)]
*  retired admiral. For him to get up on the stage and say, well, I don't know about chaos. When we [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=230.56s)]
*  saw those images, as you said, we saw that the baby's been brought over the razor wire. We saw [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=235.12s)]
*  Taliban literally beating Americans trying to get to the gates. I mean, so for you to say that's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=239.92s)]
*  not chaos, we know we can't trust this administration to tell us the truth on anything, if that's what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=244.55999999999997s)]
*  they're saying. And then he takes it a step further and he says, well, this isn't about [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=250.16s)]
*  accountability. And I'm looking at this as someone who served in the Army. We would honestly, we would [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=253.83999999999997s)]
*  hold 18-year-old privates accountable for losing a few hundred dollars worth of equipment in the [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=258.71999999999997s)]
*  Army. You need to tell me, no one in that administration is going to take accountability [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=263.76s)]
*  for the loss of American lives, for the millions of dollars of equipment left behind in Afghanistan [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=267.6s)]
*  with this withdrawal. So I serve as chairman of a group called Veterans on Duty. And our organization [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=272.48s)]
*  was actually founded by a lot of combat veterans who served in Afghanistan who are saying, look, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=278.64000000000004s)]
*  we're sick of what's happening. What's coming out of the White House right now. We need answers. We [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=284.24s)]
*  want transparent, we want a transparent administration. And we need a stronger national security and a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=288.64000000000004s)]
*  ready military. And so I'm proud to serve alongside a lot of these folks. And it's just, it is, it is, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=293.44s)]
*  we are sick of seeing time and time again, all these displays of cowardice. We need leadership [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=298.32s)]
*  and that's what's missing right now in our White House. And yet, Dagan, Kirby defended President [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=304.48s)]
*  Biden. And I think what's hard for us to stomach is, is the absolute lack of acknowledgement of so many [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=309.92s)]
*  failures. Well, I guess some small successes. Let's take a listen to him defending President Biden. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=315.44s)]
*  You got to look at when he came into office, what he was walking into. He didn't negotiate with the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=320.96s)]
*  Taliban. He didn't invite the Taliban to Camp David. He didn't release 5,000 prisoners. He [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  didn't reduce force levels in Afghanistan to 2,500. And he didn't have an arrangement with the Taliban [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=330.4s)]
*  that they weren't attack our troops. He came in with a certain set of circumstances. He had no [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=335.68s)]
*  ability to change. He had to deal with it based on what he inherited. And yet he had a contrast, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=340.47999999999996s)]
*  Stegan, to former Secretary Pompeo's analysis, which was, yeah, we had in place a conditional [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=345.92s)]
*  situation that would have allowed the protection of American forces, the withdrawal of those forces, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=350.88s)]
*  while not obliterating so many lives there on the ground as well, let alone leaving allies behind to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=356.64000000000004s)]
*  this day. Sean Duffy and I talked to Cash Patel yesterday, the President Trump's Chief of Staff [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=362.0s)]
*  for the Department of Defense. And he said, Biden's own Department of Defense Inspector General's [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=370.72s)]
*  report points out the key piece of intelligence, do not give up the Bagram airfield, never ever, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=377.6s)]
*  because of its proximity to China, because it was our forward operating base for the U.S. and allied [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=387.68s)]
*  partners. And because it's our staging platform where we housed and detained alleged terrorists [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=394.0s)]
*  in Bagram jails. And the suicide bomber who killed those 13 U.S. service members came directly out [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=400.72s)]
*  of that Bagram detention center after Joe Biden let those prisoners out. So how can they say the [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=410.72s)]
*  Trump administration did not provide intel and the recommendation to keep the Bagram airfield, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=419.28s)]
*  which is widely known? To quote Cash Patel, Biden decided to throw that plan out along with American [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=425.67999999999995s)]
*  lives. So to Jeremy's point, and I will say this again, the American people saw what happened and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=434.15999999999997s)]
*  they heard the lies out of Biden's mouth over and over again in August of 20 of 2021. And it was a [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=443.12s)]
*  vile cocktail of incompetence and dishonesty over and over again. You can get to the airport [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=452.56s)]
*  if you want to. Al-Qaeda's gone from Afghanistan. My military advisors didn't tell me to keep [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=459.84000000000003s)]
*  2500 troops in Afghanistan. And ever since then, he has had a net disapproval rating. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=469.84s)]
*  And what they're trying to do, the timing of this, I suspect is because he's running for re-election [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=478.47999999999996s)]
*  and they're trying to reverse the narrative that none of this is his responsibility. And Peter [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=487.12s)]
*  Ducey pointed out, where was he yesterday? They announced this right before the Easter weekend [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=493.84s)]
*  on Monday, Thursday. He was in a car with the first lady heading out going to Camp David. Again, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=498.56s)]
*  he will, he is trying to disavow all of this disaster, which is firmly on his head, neck, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=505.52s)]
*  and shoulders. And curiously, Molly, up near the top of this report, it says somehow that the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=512.32s)]
*  mission was accomplished, somehow that the mission was successful. Yeah, I, you know, I printed this [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=517.84s)]
*  out to read it because as Dagan mentioned, dropped on a Thursday, not a lot of time to read it before [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=523.52s)]
*  the press briefing. So journalists didn't have a whole lot of time to ingest this. But beyond the [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=527.44s)]
*  argument he made about there not being any chaos, he spent a lot of time talking about how this was [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=532.5600000000001s)]
*  the prior administration's fault, which is all over this document. It's a short document, but on [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=538.24s)]
*  nearly every page it points backwards instead of there on the spot. President Biden's choices for [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=542.96s)]
*  how to execute a withdrawal from Afghanistan were severely constrained by conditions created by his [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=549.36s)]
*  predecessor. President Biden had committed to ending the war in Afghanistan, but when he came [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=555.04s)]
*  into office, he was confronted with difficult realities left to him by the Trump administration. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=559.1999999999999s)]
*  There are many, many sightings throughout just this very brief report where it points backwards. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=564.4s)]
*  But House Foreign Affairs Chairman Michael McCaul, a Republican from Texas, said that President Biden [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=570.0799999999999s)]
*  made the decision to withdraw and even pick the exact date he is responsible for the massive [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=575.28s)]
*  failures in planning and execution. So while this report came back, we'll immediately see that sort [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=579.8399999999999s)]
*  of pushback. And so, Tommy, we have President Biden who wants to take credit apparently for that idea [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=584.72s)]
*  and yet bears no responsibility of how it was executed. What's frustrating for me is that they [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=590.32s)]
*  constantly use this, well, we don't want endless wars. You're right, we don't. I don't think that [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=596.08s)]
*  there are a lot of Americans that think that we should have stayed in Afghanistan in perpetuity. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=601.28s)]
*  I don't think that you're going to find a lot of agreement that we should have stayed there. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=604.8000000000001s)]
*  However, you don't leave the way that you did. And to blame that on President Trump when you are the [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=607.9200000000001s)]
*  commander in chief is a dereliction of duty. And quite frankly, it's a slap in the face, [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=612.24s)]
*  not only to those service members who served and died, but to the American people. You are the [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=616.4s)]
*  commander in chief, you are the leader. This is up to you. You don't leave $7 billion worth of [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=621.44s)]
*  equipment and resources. You don't leave 13 service members who have given up their life, [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=626.8s)]
*  not because they chose to and then this was a part of their duty. It was, but they didn't have to die. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qf7YnuDNHZQ&t=631.36s)]
