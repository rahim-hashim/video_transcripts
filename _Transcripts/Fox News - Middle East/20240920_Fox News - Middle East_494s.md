# Former Israeli PM responds to AOC scolding Israel for attacks on Hezbollah
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI)
*  Former Israeli Prime Minister Naftali Bennett joins me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=0.0s)]
*  He was the 13th Prime Minister of Israel, unseating current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=2.64s)]
*  who then went back into power after the time that Bennett served from June of 2021 to June of 2022. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=8.0s)]
*  He represented a party at that time called the New Right Political Party. At the end of his term, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=15.52s)]
*  he served as the third alternate prime minister for five months before announcing that he would [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=20.88s)]
*  not at that time run again. Prime Minister Bennett, great to have you here today. Thank you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=25.2s)]
*  Thank you for having me. Very much. So explain to Americans the meaning of these strikes against [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=29.44s)]
*  Hezbollah and how, are they a signal that the war is entering a new phase and that we will see a lot [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=34.4s)]
*  more of this? Yes, they are. I want to explain to the American public though that Hezbollah and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=41.68s)]
*  Hamas are two different organizations in two different geographies. Hezbollah, in an unprovoked [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=47.52s)]
*  fashion, began shooting rockets at Israel following Hamas' assault on October 7th. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=54.4s)]
*  And since then, they've been shooting 8,000 rockets at Israel. They killed dozens of Israelis, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=62.0s)]
*  including 12 children in a soccer, playing soccer, and young children. And Israel generally has been [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=68.16s)]
*  showing too much restraint, in my opinion, for the past 11 months, but enough is enough. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=79.04s)]
*  And what we're seeing right now is the weeding out of these arcterrorists who, you know, should [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=85.52s)]
*  have died decades ago. Ibrahim Akhil should have not existed for the past 30 years. He killed [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=91.84s)]
*  over 200 Americans, by the way. There was a seven million dollar bounty on his head from the United [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=99.68s)]
*  States. We're not going to ask, we're not going to send a bill because America is helping us [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=105.44s)]
*  greatly. But the point is that these are big terrorists, global terrorists, and we're killing [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=111.36s)]
*  them. And that's just wonderful news for the world. So with regard to the reaction to this [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=118.56s)]
*  extraordinary pager operation, was carried out by Israel? Can you confirm that? I don't know. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=125.36s)]
*  So, AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, spoke out about it. She said that it violated the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=135.84s)]
*  tenets of international warfare. She was scolding Israel for carrying this out. I know you cannot [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=144.32s)]
*  confirm that. What's your reaction when you hear what she says? I would tell the terrorist to find [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=150.88s)]
*  a different job. I mean, if you're in the business of murdering citizens as your life career, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=158.96s)]
*  you should expect lots of bad things will happen to you and, incidentally, to people around you. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=167.36s)]
*  There is one way to safeguard your family, and it's to quit being a terrorist. So I would [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=174.24s)]
*  highly recommend that any Hezbollah terrorist right now who seeks to live and to have a better [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=181.28s)]
*  future for his family, to call up Nasrallah and say, I quit, man. I don't want to die. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=190.4s)]
*  There's a UN meeting this week and a rally today outside the brother of one of the hostages who was [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=196.24s)]
*  killed, of the six who were killed, along with Hirsch Goldberg-Polin and four others. This is [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=203.04s)]
*  what he had to say. He's frustrated, of course, about what happened. Watch. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=208.56s)]
*  Your life could have been saved so many times. You were meant to be returned to your life [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=214.24s)]
*  and to your loved ones. We can't turn back the clock for you, Kamel, but we can control this moment. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=220.24s)]
*  The time to act is now. There was a piece in the Wall Street Journal today that indicated that the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=229.28s)]
*  White House is really at the end of the road in terms of thinking that they will be able to help [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=234.32s)]
*  negotiate any kind of agreement before the end of Biden's term. What do you say to these families? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=239.76s)]
*  We need to bring the hostages home. They were kidnapped from their beds, from their homes [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  early in the morning. They did nothing wrong to anyone, and it's our responsibility as the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=253.2s)]
*  Jewish state to take care of our citizens. I will say that Yiches Sanwar is not under enough pressure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=258.4s)]
*  because if he were, he'd come to the negotiation table. He's not making, he's not there, and I [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=268.56s)]
*  think we need to... Do you believe he wants a deal? I think not enough, and the only way to get him to [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=274.4s)]
*  want a deal is for him to see an imminent threat on his life, tanks rolling towards him. I think [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=281.12s)]
*  right now Israel is prosecuting this war way too slow, way too weak. We need to strengthen... [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=287.52s)]
*  What do you think, when you hear American politicians say that they, and the President, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=298.4s)]
*  President Biden, basically saying you need to tone it down, this is too much what's happening [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=302.08s)]
*  in Gaza. What do you say to him right now? Well, if thousands of Americans were massacred from, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=306.71999999999997s)]
*  let's say, some town in Mexico, from Al-Qaeda hosted in Mexico, America would demolish that [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=316.4s)]
*  town. I mean, what would you do? What would you do if people invaded your homes here in New York [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=324.15999999999997s)]
*  or wherever and butchered your families and shot thousands and thousands of rockets for years? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=330.32s)]
*  If anything, Israel's mistake is not doing the war, it's why we waited so long. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  This is former President Trump at the Israeli-American Council last evening, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=342.8s)]
*  and he's encouraging Jewish voters in America saying that voting for him [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=348.96000000000004s)]
*  is a vote for Israel, for the future of Israel. Watch. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=355.12s)]
*  If we continue down our current path with four more years of Kamala, Israel will be faced not [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=359.04s)]
*  just with an attack but with total annihilation. Anybody who's Jewish and loves being Jewish and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=365.84s)]
*  loves Israel is a fool if they vote for a Democrat. Do you agree with him? Well, obviously I never [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=374.96s)]
*  intervene in the domestic American politics. We've got enough of our mess in Israel. We don't need to [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=384.15999999999997s)]
*  push our noses into your mess. I will say this, that the Jews in America need Israel to be [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=390.64s)]
*  really strong because ultimately Israel is the only nation state of Jews in the world. It's a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=400.0s)]
*  tiny little country the size of New Jersey. You know, people might think it's Texas or something, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=406.72s)]
*  tiny little tract of land surrounded by horrible people, and Jews need a strong Israel, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  and Israel needs a strong Jewish community across the world, and for all of that to happen, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=419.76000000000005s)]
*  we just need to do one thing. We need to win. You were quoted recently as saying that you would do [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=425.20000000000005s)]
*  whatever it takes if you were assigned, you know, sweeping the floors to help your country. That's [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=430.8s)]
*  what you would do. Would you return to politics? Would you like to be Prime Minister again, and do [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  you think you would do a better job than Netanyahu? I'll do anything for my country. The only two [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=440.72s)]
*  things I care about in the world are my family and my nation, and I'll be at any place I need to be [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=447.36s)]
*  to help save and strengthen the state of Israel. I hope you'll join us again. These are obviously [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  very consequential times for Israel, for the Middle East, and we, next time I hope we can dig [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=460.24s)]
*  into the issue of Iran, which obviously underlies all of this from Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=465.6s)]
*  We may be headed into some very scary times, and I think it's important to keep this story in the [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=471.68s)]
*  front, in the forefront. So thank you, Prime Minister. Thank you, Martha. Very good to see you today. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3FeCUagFQI&t=475.92s)]
