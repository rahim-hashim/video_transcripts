# 'NO MORE TIME': Mother of Hamas hostage issues desperate plea for help
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk)
*  We don't have a list of the hostages. We don't know their condition. I don't have anything. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=0.0s)]
*  So I need your help. I'm so proud of being an American, being an Israeli as well. But [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=8.28s)]
*  I do need you now because there's nothing helping me now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=16.04s)]
*  Doris Lieber in an emotional plea for help during a news conference held by House Republican [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=21.2s)]
*  leaders yesterday. You would have seen her live on America's newsroom. Well, her son [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  Guy Elouz has been missing since the Hamas terror attack at the Israeli Music Festival [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=29.32s)]
*  on October 7th. Just one of many atrocities carried out by the Iranian-backed terror group [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=33.68s)]
*  on that horrific day. Doris joins us now. Doris, thank you for being here. After you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=38.6s)]
*  gave the press conference yesterday with House Republican leaders, you then went on to have [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=44.24s)]
*  many meetings. And I think it would be helpful for us to understand what was the reception [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=48.68s)]
*  that you were getting. And you asked for help. Do you think you will get it? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=53.74s)]
*  I hope so. It's help that I need. I need action now. You know, we've been waiting [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=60.54s)]
*  for over a month now and nothing is progressing. So this is a time to take action. Anybody [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=69.86s)]
*  influence or do anything, there's no more time. There's babies there, elderly, sick, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=78.18s)]
*  people that need attention. And I need my son back. You certainly do. What would action [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=87.78s)]
*  look like to you? What do you mean? Well, when you say you need action, so obviously [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=93.74000000000001s)]
*  we want the hostages to be released unconditionally and immediately. That should be the number [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=101.66000000000001s)]
*  one action. But when you say you would like to see some action, does that mean our Congress [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=106.36s)]
*  passing some support in terms of resources? Or are you looking for additional types of [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=112.44s)]
*  action that would be maybe more something kinetic on the ground that would help get [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=118.24s)]
*  them out? Both. Anything. Anything that can help. Negotiations must be conducted or started [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=122.44s)]
*  or shared with the people because we're lost here. We have no information whatsoever [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=130.44s)]
*  about our loved ones. And we were meeting with very powerful meetings from both parties [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=140.12s)]
*  and yeah, that's my plea right now. We need to do something. The sympathy that we got [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=147.92s)]
*  is heartwarming, no doubt. But it's not a time to sit and be sympathetic. It's a time [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=154.92s)]
*  to see what we can really do to get some kind of progress here. Representative Richie Torres [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=164.27999999999997s)]
*  is from New York and he had some comments that I think are very interesting about ceasefire [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  versus hostage release. Listen here. I find it troubling that the House has been [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=177.39999999999998s)]
*  I find it troubling that more energy has been spent calling on Israel to enter into a ceasefire [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=183.92s)]
*  rather than calling on Hamas to surrender and release the hostages. I hear what you're [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=189.92s)]
*  saying in terms of negotiations and I think as we have a relationship with Qatar and we [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=195.32s)]
*  could put some more pressure there perhaps. I mean I know the State Department is doing [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=199.92s)]
*  their thing. But you said you met with members of both parties and you felt that the support [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=203.38s)]
*  was there. Do you think that the pro-Palestinian perspective on Capitol Hill or in Washington, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=208.4s)]
*  did you find that to be small or was it troubling? It's good to have voices heard out and everybody [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=215.72s)]
*  has his own voice. But at this time, this is not a question of pro-Palestinians or pro-Israeli [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=229.24s)]
*  or pro-Israel. It has nothing to do with it. It's civilians. There are human right laws [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=239.12s)]
*  and they were crossed. So it's like it's scrambling everything together. I don't [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=247.12s)]
*  think that's helping. The pro-Palestinian problem is, you know, goes back and it's [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=254.36s)]
*  probably something that will not be solved. I wish it would. In Israel today, you know, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=261.36s)]
*  like a quarter of the population are Arabs if they're Christian or Muslim and we live [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  very good together and I really hope that would be the case. I hear you. That's left [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  for politicians or, you know, deplorers. Right. You want to see the pro-Palestinian side. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=283.76s)]
*  Honestly. And you want your son back and we want that for you as well. Doris Lieber, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  thank you for joining us today. Thank you very much. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpJl8rO1hkk&t=296.28000000000003s)]
