# Tax Day has to be the favorite holiday of Biden, Democrat Party: GOP rep
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA)
*  Now for more on Iran's direct attack on Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=0.0s)]
*  joining me is the chairman of the House and Ways and Means Committee, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=2.56s)]
*  Congressman Jason Smith. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=4.96s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thanks very much for joining us. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=6.4s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=8.84s)]
*  You know, what Iran did last night, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=10.96s)]
*  just as the direct result, Maria, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=14.4s)]
*  of Biden's policies and Biden's rhetoric [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  over the last several years as president, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=21.44s)]
*  and that gave Iran the opportunity [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=25.04s)]
*  that they felt like it could go in and attack [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=27.68s)]
*  one of our greatest allies, Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=31.84s)]
*  Yeah, enabling Iran to generate billions of dollars in oil [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  has created something of a rich country once again. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  Under President Trump, I don't think they actually had the wherewithal to do this. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=44.8s)]
*  Under President Trump, he imposed the strict standards of the sanctions [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=50.44s)]
*  on the Iranians and allowed them where they didn't grow billions of dollars [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=55.72s)]
*  in profits and oil exports. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=60.84s)]
*  But unfortunately, the Biden administration has reversed course on that, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=62.84s)]
*  and they have been very lax on those sanctions, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=66.72s)]
*  allowing the Iranians to grow in more power, more economic growth, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=68.92s)]
*  and now they're attacking their neighbors. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=72.92s)]
*  Let me switch gears. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=76.04s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, tomorrow, of course, is Tax Day, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=76.88s)]
*  and right before April 15th, we see this watchdog report [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=79.4s)]
*  that the IRS has been targeting people [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=83.92s)]
*  who are making under $200,000 for their audits. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=86.8s)]
*  Can you tell us why the IRS is targeting those people [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=90.2s)]
*  making $200,000 or less in terms of audits? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=94.4s)]
*  The majority of audits, 63%. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  Maria, we have been trying to sound this alarm for some time. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=101.36s)]
*  It all started with the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=104.44s)]
*  where the Biden administration asked for an additional $80 billion [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=106.56s)]
*  to supercharge the IRS to hire 87,000 new agents. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=111.36s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=114.96s)]
*  Based on scorekeepers in Congress, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=116.0s)]
*  it is projected that that 87,000 new auditors, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=119.44s)]
*  70% of those audits will be on people making less than $75,000 a year. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=124.44s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=131.0s)]
*  The Biden administration, they didn't think $80 billion was enough, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=131.84s)]
*  so they asked for an additional $43 billion just in their budget this year. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=135.0s)]
*  And to try to comprehend how big of dollars those are, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=140.07999999999998s)]
*  the IRS just operating a yearly budget is less than $15 billion a year. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=144.28s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I'm wondering why you're seeing all of these audits now [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=150.76s)]
*  when the president has repeatedly said that anyone making $400,000 or more [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=155.72s)]
*  or less would not be a target. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=161.2s)]
*  But you've got this watchdog, the findings of the IRS watchdog, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=163.44s)]
*  the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=167.76s)]
*  examining this and coming up with 63%. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=170.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, the president also said that he wouldn't raise taxes [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  on people making less than $400,000 a year, too, Maria. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=180.35999999999999s)]
*  But in fact, his budget does that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=184.32s)]
*  His budget raises taxes more than $7 trillion on people [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=185.92s)]
*  making less than $400,000 will also see a tax increase. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=192.16s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=196.16s)]
*  Tell me about Tax Day tomorrow. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=197.32s)]
*  How much tax revenue are you expecting this year? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=199.04s)]
*  So, the best way to say is, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=203.08s)]
*  Tax Day has to be the favourite holiday of Joe Biden and the Democrat Party. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=205.2s)]
*  You can see by their desire to just continue to raise taxes here and there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=210.8s)]
*  When you look at the revenues that we had in the year 20, the year before, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=216.6s)]
*  it was almost $5 trillion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=221.6s)]
*  It was record revenues, Maria. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=223.48s)]
*  And in fact, those revenues were almost $900 billion more [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  than what the Joint Tax Committee had projected [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=231.11999999999998s)]
*  based on passage of the 2017 Trump tax cuts. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=234.92s)]
*  It showed that that helped bring in the revenue. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=239.16s)]
*  Our country does not have a revenue problem, Maria. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=241.76s)]
*  Our country has a spending problem. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=244.83999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, and the spending has sent inflation to 40-year highs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=247.11999999999998s)]
*  This past week, we got another inflation reading with things like, you know, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=250.2s)]
*  bread up 30%, year-over-year flour up 24%. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=254.72s)]
*  I mean, across the board, Americans are feeling the pinch of inflation. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=259.04s)]
*  What are your thoughts on the spending package [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=263.96s)]
*  that you all will be looking at this week in terms of sending money to Ukraine? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=266.36s)]
*  First off, let's not forget that this inflation crisis, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=272.32s)]
*  that the inflation's gone up almost 20% since Joe Biden's taken the oath of office, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=275.64s)]
*  was the direct result of $10 trillion of new spending [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=279.76s)]
*  on top of just funding government that President Biden did [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=283.8s)]
*  with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  when they controlled all three areas of government. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=290.24s)]
*  When you look at the spending package that's moving ahead, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=293.76s)]
*  five months ago, Maria, five months ago, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=296.68s)]
*  the House of Representatives passed funding for Israel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=299.44s)]
*  And the United States Senate has left that bill on the sidelines. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=303.15999999999997s)]
*  They need to pick up and pass that bill. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=307.12s)]
*  We need to defend and protect and supply funds [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=309.56s)]
*  for our greatest ally in the Middle East. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=312.84s)]
*  Yes, it seems that it's going to be attached to money for Ukraine and Taiwan, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=314.35999999999996s)]
*  but we'll be watching your work this week. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=320.12s)]
*  Congressman, thank you very much for being here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pn3kTRh_eKA&t=321.64s)]
