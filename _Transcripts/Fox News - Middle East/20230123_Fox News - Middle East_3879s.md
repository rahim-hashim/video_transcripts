# White House reacts to Comer calling Biden's document scandal a potential 'cover-up'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8)
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Monday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=6.0s)]
*  As many of you are tracking this week, House Republicans will vote to raise gas prices [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  on American families. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=13.52s)]
*  The contrast in priorities could not be more stark. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=14.86s)]
*  The president spent the last two years, as you know, doing everything he could to lower [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=19.18s)]
*  for American families, and prices are down about $1.60 a gallon since last summer. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=25.0s)]
*  Now, House Republicans are using their narrow majority to force the American people to pay [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=31.0s)]
*  higher gas prices just as big oil companies are amassing record profits. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=36.44s)]
*  What's even more alarming is that this is not the only attempt by House Republicans' [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=42.44s)]
*  majority to raise costs on middle-class families. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=48.92s)]
*  House Republicans are also pushing a tax increase on middle-class families and inflation-worsening [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=52.64s)]
*  tax cut for the rich and high prescription drug costs as well. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=58.12s)]
*  These extreme policies would subject working families to immense financial pain and balloon [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=62.84s)]
*  our deficit all just to benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and big corporations. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=68.52s)]
*  Joining me today, as you all see to my right, is Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm to talk [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=74.12s)]
*  about how the House Republicans' latest attempt to raise prices for American families will [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=80.08s)]
*  result in oil supply shortages and help Putin's war aims by interfering with our ability to [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=85.16s)]
*  release oil. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  Secretary Granholm, the floor is yours. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=93.52000000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Kareem. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  Hello, everybody. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  I'm honored to be here again. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=97.52000000000001s)]
*  As Kareem said, you know, President Biden really has been singularly focused on reducing [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  costs for American families, especially energy costs, especially both transportation as well [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=108.0s)]
*  as at home, whether it's increasing the biofuel blends of gasoline to offering additional [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=115.2s)]
*  funds through weatherization for lowering costs for low and moderate income households. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=123.08s)]
*  But particularly, he has acted to shore up additional oil supply following the market [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=129.52s)]
*  disruptions that were the result of Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=137.16000000000003s)]
*  Coordinating with allies and with partners through the International Energy Agency, he [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=143.84s)]
*  secured globally a collective release of 240 million barrels of oil from strategic petroleum [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=151.08s)]
*  reserves worldwide. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  As Kareem said, the average price of a gallon of gas is now down about $1.60 from last summer's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=162.64000000000001s)]
*  peak, about a 30 percent decline. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=169.94000000000003s)]
*  And in fact, prices are lower today, gas prices are, than what they were at the start of Russia's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=173.3s)]
*  invasion. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=180.22000000000003s)]
*  Analysts who have looked at this have credited the releases from the Strategic Petroleum [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=182.9s)]
*  Reserve for filling the supply gaps that were resulting from the invasion and the lessening [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=187.9s)]
*  of Russian oil on a global market and have credited the SPR with lowering prices. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=195.98s)]
*  In earlier in January, for example, the global head of energy analysis for the oil price [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=202.38s)]
*  information service said, and I'm quoting him, his name is Tom Closa, there is no question [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=209.22s)]
*  that SPR sales mitigated the price impact of crude last year. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=216.1s)]
*  Yet, as Kareem said, House Republicans are now pursuing this extreme agenda that risks [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=221.82s)]
*  worsening supply shortages in times of crisis and risks raising prices, gas prices for American [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=228.78s)]
*  families. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=238.1s)]
*  When you consider H.R. 21, which is a bill that they've introduced, it needlessly aims [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=239.54s)]
*  to weaken the Strategic Petroleum Reserve's usefulness as a tool to ensure energy security [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=245.62s)]
*  in America. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=253.38s)]
*  The SPR, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, gives us the means to increase supply when [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=254.38s)]
*  the market needs it most. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=260.78000000000003s)]
*  And it gives us the tool to increase it quickly, quickly being the operative word. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=262.6s)]
*  Speed is key. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=267.94s)]
*  But H.R. 21 would impose unnecessary, unhelpful restrictions on when the SPR can be used to [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=270.38s)]
*  help provide supply. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=279.58s)]
*  It would require these arbitrary reports regarding energy production on federal lands before [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=281.64s)]
*  waiving any new restrictions. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=288.02s)]
*  It would not offer any tangible benefits to the American people. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=290.58s)]
*  Instead, it would interfere with our ability to be responsive to release oil during an [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=295.38s)]
*  international emergency. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=300.94s)]
*  Helping Putin's war aims, it would potentially delay allowing oil to be released for domestic [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=303.34s)]
*  emergencies, following a natural disaster or a pipeline outage at home, leaving, again, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=311.38s)]
*  at risk of rising in the wake of a market shock because of emergencies due to extreme [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=319.66s)]
*  weather events. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=325.54s)]
*  As I noted in the letter I sent to the Hill last week, be clear, there is nothing standing [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=326.54s)]
*  in the way of domestic oil and gas production. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=333.66s)]
*  In fact, production is on track for a new record in 2023. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=337.82000000000005s)]
*  From the beginning, the President set out to use SPR as a bridge, boosting oil supply [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=344.36s)]
*  while the production ramped up. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=351.52000000000004s)]
*  So production was down globally because of Russia's invasion and the pulling of Russian [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=354.8s)]
*  barrels off the market. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=360.24s)]
*  He wanted to increase the strategic petroleum reserve amounts to make a bridge while calling [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=362.24s)]
*  upon domestic oil and gas industry to increase production. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=367.7s)]
*  And that is exactly what has happened. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=372.28s)]
*  Today the SPR remains the largest strategic petroleum reserve in the world. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=375.64s)]
*  And with our plans to refill it at the lowest, you know, at lower prices than what we sold [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=381.91999999999996s)]
*  at, the use of the SPR not only saved Americans money, but these releases will end up delivering [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=389.15999999999997s)]
*  a return for taxpayers. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=397.9s)]
*  And so it's not a tool that we should be taking off the table. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=400.36s)]
*  We are willing to work with Republicans and with Democrats alike to make our system actually [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  do it, more reliable and more resilient, and our country more energy independent and costs [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=409.56s)]
*  more affordable. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=416.88s)]
*  The Inflation Reduction Act is already reducing costs and it's made the United States the [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=417.88s)]
*  most attractive country in the world to invest in clean energy production. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=423.92s)]
*  We believe there's room for bipartisanship to advance a managed transition. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=430.06s)]
*  We believe that there is room for bipartisanship to expand our ability to create more affordable, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=435.36s)]
*  reliable energy in America. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=441.74s)]
*  But proposals like H.R. 21, which risks raising these gas prices and make it an offer, harder [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=444.02s)]
*  to offer Americans relief in the future, are simply non-started. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=450.12s)]
*  So I'll be very clear. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=453.94s)]
*  If Congress were to pass H.R. 21, the President would veto it. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=456.62s)]
*  He will not allow the American people to suffer because of the backwards agenda that House [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=462.28000000000003s)]
*  Republicans are advancing. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=468.52s)]
*  So with that, I'm happy to take your questions. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=470.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=476.82s)]
*  Secretary, two questions please. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=477.32s)]
*  First on our exports of liquefied natural gas and the criticism that some environmental [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=481.02s)]
*  groups have surfaced regarding that and climate change. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=487.21999999999997s)]
*  Can you address that? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=491.74s)]
*  And number two, Texas is now, I think, poised or has already surpassed California in renewable [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=492.74s)]
*  energy production. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=498.48s)]
*  What do you make of Republican states like Texas going in on green energy? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=501.98s)]
*  And are there lessons to be learned from the way they're doing it as opposed to blue states? [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=508.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=512.1s)]
*  And so first, with respect to LNG, we know that our liquefied natural gas exports have [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=512.6s)]
*  been a significant help to our allies. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=521.78s)]
*  And it's an important, it's very important to make sure that they have the means. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=525.62s)]
*  We are fortunate in that we have an abundance, obviously, of natural gas in this country. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=530.6999999999999s)]
*  Our prices are low. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=534.74s)]
*  During times of challenge, we want to help our allies as well. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=536.62s)]
*  We want to make sure it's the cleanest natural gas, which [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=541.1800000000001s)]
*  is one of the reasons why the bipartisan infrastructure [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=543.82s)]
*  law really invested in carbon capture strategies and storage strategies. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=547.3000000000001s)]
*  So that's an ongoing issue and an ongoing conversation [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=552.14s)]
*  we're having with industry. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=555.7s)]
*  And that includes reducing methane as well. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=556.86s)]
*  But with respect to Texas, what an opportunity for every state [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=559.7s)]
*  to be able to produce clean energy. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=564.86s)]
*  And in fact, a political story this morning [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=567.7s)]
*  suggested that there was an abundance of announcements coming out of red states. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=570.0600000000001s)]
*  Great. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=577.5s)]
*  That is fantastic. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=578.42s)]
*  We want to be able to see energy, clean energy produced [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=579.58s)]
*  in every pocket of the country. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=583.22s)]
*  Blue states, red states, really it helps to save people money. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=585.42s)]
*  So it's really all about green. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=589.98s)]
*  And green in the sense of, yes, it's helpful to the planet, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=591.86s)]
*  but it's also helpful for jobs. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=594.62s)]
*  And it's also helpful for us to be energy independent, which [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=596.54s)]
*  is exactly what the president would like to see. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=600.22s)]
*  Homegrown, clean energy, independent, so that we are strong and resilient. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=602.82s)]
*  Go ahead, Steve. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=607.5s)]
*  What sort of conversations with the Senate [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=608.38s)]
*  have you been having about HR 29? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=610.42s)]
*  Well, I think the Senate knows the position that we have with respect to it. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=612.74s)]
*  And we'll see what the Senate does with it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=618.26s)]
*  But obviously, I think there's a lot of concern [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=621.58s)]
*  anything that it hampers. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=624.1s)]
*  I don't care whether it's a Democratic president or a Republican president. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=625.22s)]
*  Why would you hamper the ability of the country [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=628.22s)]
*  to be able to respond to emergencies and hamper the ability of us [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=631.7s)]
*  to be able to lower costs as a result of those emergencies? [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=636.54s)]
*  So I think the Senate understands the importance of that [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=640.5s)]
*  and hopefully will act accordingly. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=643.54s)]
*  Thanks, Madam Secretary. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=646.9s)]
*  You mentioned the refilling or replenishment of the SPR. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=648.1s)]
*  I know in January you guys, I think, kind of rejected offers. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=650.94s)]
*  You didn't feel like were adequate to start that process, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=653.38s)]
*  can you delay, at least from the February perspective. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=657.46s)]
*  What's your sense of how successful the process you guys have laid out [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=660.74s)]
*  will be given this first delay or insufficient offers? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=664.9s)]
*  And do you have any concerns about the ability [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=669.54s)]
*  to get exactly what you need based on the floor [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=671.22s)]
*  and the plan that was laid out? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=673.82s)]
*  Yeah, I have no concerns that we will be able to refill and replenish the SPR [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=675.3s)]
*  and do it at a savings to taxpayers. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=679.42s)]
*  And our goal was to start with the first 60 million barrels of replenishment. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=681.34s)]
*  The offers that we received did not meet specification or price. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=686.62s)]
*  And so we're going to stay tuned for an announcement on how we're going [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=691.62s)]
*  to go back at that first 60. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=694.7s)]
*  But we have a three-part strategy, too. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=696.02s)]
*  One is to accelerate some of the exchanges that were announced before [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=698.22s)]
*  to get those back in. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=702.62s)]
*  And second was in the omnibus bill at the end of last year, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=704.34s)]
*  we canceled the sales of the congressionally mandated sales for 24 and 25, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=708.94s)]
*  up through 27, actually. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=716.3000000000001s)]
*  So there was a significant savings of having to send out oil. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=717.5s)]
*  But we're going to continue to work on this. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=721.98s)]
*  I think in the end, because of the way this has been managed, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=723.74s)]
*  people will be pleased to see the savings to taxpayers. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=729.4200000000001s)]
*  Just real quick, could you tease a little bit [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=734.34s)]
*  at the statement that we're supposed to be staying tuned for? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=736.34s)]
*  Well, just stay tuned. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=739.26s)]
*  It's going to happen very soon. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=741.4200000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Green. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=744.98s)]
*  Thanks, Secretary Granholm. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=745.58s)]
*  So gas prices are now up $0.33 over the past month. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=747.4200000000001s)]
*  The president took credit for the prices coming down. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=751.74s)]
*  The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, as you mentioned, is no longer releasing. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=754.5s)]
*  Does the president get credit for the price of gas going up? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=757.94s)]
*  It's obviously based upon international and climate events. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=761.34s)]
*  So for example, winter storm Elliott pulled two million barrels off the US [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=764.78s)]
*  market because of refineries that went down. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=769.74s)]
*  That crimp in supply causes prices to go up. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=772.3399999999999s)]
*  What happens in China? [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=775.9s)]
*  Are they going to be opening up soon? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=777.14s)]
*  Is there expectations regarding an increase in demand? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=779.1s)]
*  That is something that happens on a global market. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=782.06s)]
*  The whole point of this is that this Strategic Petroleum Reserve [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=784.3399999999999s)]
*  is a tool that we have, that we can control. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=787.3399999999999s)]
*  We may not be able to control the weather. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=789.74s)]
*  We may not be able to control what happens at OPEC Plus or in China. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=791.42s)]
*  But we can control what we have access to. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=794.58s)]
*  And that's why this tool is so incredibly important. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=796.94s)]
*  We'll see what happens with respect to the price of gas. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=800.46s)]
*  We know that there are still refineries that [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=803.7s)]
*  have been pulled down both for maintenance as well as because of winter [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=805.46s)]
*  storm Elliott. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=811.0600000000001s)]
*  But in the end, we think it'll be balancing out soon. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=812.34s)]
*  Secretary Granholm, two questions. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=816.82s)]
*  You sounded the alarm about HR 21. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=820.4200000000001s)]
*  But let's say it did pass in both the House and the Senate. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=823.02s)]
*  And for whatever reason, the President did veto it. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=828.22s)]
*  That's a big assumption. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=831.54s)]
*  I know it is. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=832.42s)]
*  As you're sounding the alarm, we've [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=833.98s)]
*  seen some of the highest gas prices we've ever seen in this country. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=835.6999999999999s)]
*  If HR 21 were to pass and be signed into law by the President, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=841.78s)]
*  what would it look like at the pump for the average American price? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=845.46s)]
*  Prices would go up because we would have lost this tool. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=848.42s)]
*  But how high? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=850.9399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's hard to know because we don't know the circumstances around it. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=852.18s)]
*  We don't know what would be the reason for actually exercising [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=856.14s)]
*  an additional action at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=860.12s)]
*  But know this, prices would go up because we don't have this tool. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=862.8199999999999s)]
*  And again, it's always in response to an emergency, like war or like an extreme [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=867.78s)]
*  weather event. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=873.6999999999999s)]
*  We do know that taking that tool off the table would harm the American family. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=875.14s)]
*  And lastly, the second question. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=879.54s)]
*  When the President did release the strategic oil reserves [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=881.9399999999999s)]
*  and the million-day gallons came out, or barrels, whatever it was. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=885.3s)]
*  No barrels, yeah. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=890.4599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we get the numbers. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=891.26s)]
*  But in the midst of that, there were some communities that felt the relief. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=893.4599999999999s)]
*  Other communities did not, particularly those in urban areas. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=900.18s)]
*  There was price gouging, et cetera. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=904.02s)]
*  Could you talk about that? [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=905.5799999999999s)]
*  Because we're still very, we're still, this could actually happen again at some point. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=906.86s)]
*  And could you explain why there was such a difference in communities with gas prices [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=913.58s)]
*  in one community versus another? [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=917.26s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, there are definitely differences in terms of infrastructure [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=918.66s)]
*  across the country. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=922.3000000000001s)]
*  And so some rural areas, for example, or some who might be at the very end of a line, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=923.3000000000001s)]
*  or may not even have a line, that may get it trucked in, it takes longer [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=930.5s)]
*  and it's more expensive. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=934.54s)]
*  If you're not near a refinery, that's another reason why the transportation costs [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=936.06s)]
*  are tacked on at the pump. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=939.86s)]
*  So you're seeing, for example, when refineries go down in regions, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=941.74s)]
*  then the prices go up in those regions much more than they would nationwide. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=946.46s)]
*  So a lot of it depends on local infrastructure. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=951.54s)]
*  Specifically the urban areas, because there was still a big pinch in urban areas [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=954.5s)]
*  with these gas prices when the outbound communities, particularly majority white [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=959.34s)]
*  communities, were seeing the drop to $3. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=964.34s)]
*  And many of these urban areas were seeing $4 and $5 gas prices. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=966.78s)]
*  Could you speak to that? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=969.66s)]
*  Yeah, here's what I would say is that obviously gas station owners are often [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=970.46s)]
*  owned by individuals. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=976.14s)]
*  Most of them are not part of the branded oil companies. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=977.58s)]
*  Most of them are owned by individuals. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=982.86s)]
*  And so if an individual is taking advantage in a region, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=985.0600000000001s)]
*  that is something that for sure, and I know I did when I was an attorney general, [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=991.18s)]
*  local attorney, I mean, state attorney general should go after it, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=996.66s)]
*  because gouging is illegal. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=998.98s)]
*  You cannot take advantage of a crisis to jack up prices in that way. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1000.78s)]
*  So we encourage local law enforcement to really get on it, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1005.58s)]
*  because that should not be happening absent some other infrastructure lack [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1010.78s)]
*  that might cause prices to go up. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1017.54s)]
*  Last question for you. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1019.74s)]
*  Since you oversee the nuclear arsenal, and it's 11 months now with the war in Ukraine, [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1020.86s)]
*  has anything changed in your management, maintenance, and so forth [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1026.06s)]
*  of the nuclear arsenal given the potential concerns of war [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1031.02s)]
*  and some of the threats that have come from Russia? [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1036.7s)]
*  Well, it is clear that we are singularly focused at the NNSA [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1039.54s)]
*  of making sure that we have a stockpile that is safe, secure, and effective. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1045.6200000000001s)]
*  And so all of the modernization plans that are happening at the NNSA [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1050.54s)]
*  are pointed in that direction. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1055.5s)]
*  So we're watching this very carefully, obviously. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1059.3s)]
*  But people should know that we have incredible relationship [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1063.58s)]
*  with the Department of Defense and incredible professionals who [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1067.18s)]
*  are experts at the NNSA who are focused on making sure that those three things, [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1071.02s)]
*  safe, secure, and effective are the adjectives that we apply to the stockpile. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1075.4599999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1080.4199999999998s)]

*  Thank you, guys. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1090.62s)]
*  As you saw last night, the president and the first lady [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1092.34s)]
*  shared their condolences for those killed and injured [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1095.1799999999998s)]
*  in the deadly mass shooting in Monterey Park, which is in California, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1098.22s)]
*  as you all know, this past weekend. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1102.6599999999999s)]
*  The president was briefed early yesterday morning [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1104.84s)]
*  by his Homeland Security advisor, Liz Sherwood Randall, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1107.04s)]
*  and directed her to ensure full federal support for local officials [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1112.28s)]
*  responding to the situation. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1116.04s)]
*  She continued to provide him with updates throughout the day and evening. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1117.9599999999998s)]
*  Our team continues to be in regular contact with law enforcement officials, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1121.6799999999998s)]
*  leading the response. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1126.28s)]
*  And the president has been briefed today on the latest developments. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1127.8s)]
*  As the president said last night, while there [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1131.78s)]
*  is still much we don't know about this attack, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1133.84s)]
*  we do know how deeply it has impacted the AAPI community. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1137.6799999999998s)]
*  Monterey Park is home to one of the largest AAPI communities in America, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1142.12s)]
*  many of whom were celebrating the Lunar New Year along with loved ones [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1147.56s)]
*  and friends this past weekend. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1152.12s)]
*  But instead of celebrating yesterday, many families in Monterey Park [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1154.4399999999998s)]
*  were grieving or praying that their loved one will recover from their wounds. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1158.28s)]
*  Last night, the president lowered the flags at the White House [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1164.04s)]

*  Now turning on to another piece of news for all of you, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1172.12s)]
*  as you all saw last week, the State Department [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1175.36s)]
*  launched the Welcome Corps, a new private sponsorship program that [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1177.6799999999998s)]
*  will create opportunities for Americans to directly sponsor refugees [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1181.9199999999998s)]
*  from around the world arriving through the US Refugee Admissions Program. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1186.02s)]
*  The Welcome Corps is the boldest innovation in US refugee resettlement [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1190.52s)]
*  in four decades and will make a meaningful difference [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1194.48s)]
*  in the lives of refugees and Americans alike. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1197.48s)]
*  The Welcome Corps program is designated to strengthen and expand [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1199.96s)]
*  our country's capacity to resettle refugees [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1203.72s)]
*  by harnessing the energy of private sponsors [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1206.44s)]
*  from all over the United States. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1209.68s)]
*  Local communities have long been at the heart of America's resettlement program, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1212.08s)]
*  and we have seen over the past year the overwhelming response [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1217.12s)]
*  of the American people to welcome our Afghan allies, Ukrainians displaced [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1221.1999999999998s)]
*  by war, and Venezuelans fleeing violence and oppression. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1225.8799999999999s)]
*  The Welcome Corps builds on this enthusiasm [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1229.7199999999998s)]
*  by establishing a durable program for Americans [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1232.1599999999999s)]
*  to privately sponsor refugees from around the world. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1235.0s)]
*  Groups of private sponsors will help refugees find housing and employment, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1238.52s)]
*  enroll children in school, and connect with other essential services [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1243.92s)]
*  so they can thrive in their new home. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1247.94s)]
*  The State Department is working with a consortium of nonprofit organization [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1251.16s)]
*  with expertise in welcoming, resettling, and integrating refugees [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1255.4s)]
*  into US communities to make this program a success. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1259.92s)]
*  This Welcome Corps team will guide private sponsors [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1263.88s)]
*  through every step of sponsorship journey. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1267.4s)]
*  Our goal for the program's first year is to mobilize [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1270.52s)]
*  at least 10,000 Americans to step forward as private sponsors [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1273.24s)]
*  and offer a welcoming hand to at least 5,000 refugees. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1277.64s)]
*  I'm proud to share we're already off to a strong start [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1282.96s)]
*  thanks to the generosity and tremendous support of Americans [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1285.64s)]
*  across the country. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1288.24s)]

*  joined in expressing their support for the program, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1299.76s)]
*  more than 100,000 people have visited the Welcome Corps website [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1302.68s)]

*  the US refugee admissions program, and the Welcome Corps [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1328.8600000000001s)]
*  is one of the many ways in which we are doing this. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1332.36s)]
*  We encourage anyone who is indeed interested in sponsoring refugees [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1335.7199999999998s)]

*  we all work together. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1371.68s)]
*  In Baltimore, the president will discuss how bipartisan infrastructure law [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1374.32s)]

*  as many of you have probably experienced and gone through [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1383.48s)]
*  during your outing in your cars, to address the largest bottleneck [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1387.12s)]

*  Both projects will create good paying jobs, including union jobs, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1412.1200000000001s)]
*  lower commuting times, and enhanced safety. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1415.56s)]
*  These two critical, important projects funded by the president's [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1418.88s)]
*  bipartisan infrastructure law, much like the Brent Spence Bridge project [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1421.96s)]
*  connecting Ohio and Kentucky that the president visited just a few weeks ago [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1426.8000000000002s)]

*  During both visits, the president will also [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1441.2s)]
*  discuss how his economic plan to build an economy from the bottom up [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1443.1200000000001s)]

*  With that, Zeke, you want to kick us off? [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1453.96s)]
*  Thanks, Lee. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1455.56s)]
*  The president and the vice president have any plans to visit [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1456.56s)]
*  the community of Monterey Park in my local experience? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1458.84s)]
*  No, that's a good question. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1461.44s)]
*  Don't have anything to share at this time on any travel to California, [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1462.6399999999999s)]
*  specifically Monterey Park at this time. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1466.8s)]
*  But if we have, if that changes, certainly we will share that with all of you. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1469.04s)]
*  And then over the weekend, there was a reporting that Ron Plano [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1472.16s)]
*  sent me down to the chief of staff, Peter Fisk, my Jeff Zients. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1475.32s)]
*  Can you confirm that? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1478.3999999999999s)]
*  And when will that change or will it be a federal? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1479.3999999999999s)]
*  So look, I know many of you have a lot of questions on this. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1481.76s)]
*  I know that you might have a lot of questions today on this particular story. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1484.52s)]
*  Don't have anything to preview or share or announce at this time. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1488.52s)]
*  I do want to take just a personal point of personal privilege [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1493.1599999999999s)]
*  as when the president was senator would say. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1497.48s)]
*  Look, Ron has been an incredible boss. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1500.84s)]
*  He has someone that I've enjoyed working with every day. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1503.6399999999999s)]
*  And we are many of us, and I think all of us here are part of the Kleenex. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1507.28s)]
*  If you don't know, I suggest you go on Twitter and find out what the Kleenex are. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1512.0s)]
*  But he has been an incredible leader, an incredible boss, as I just stated. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1516.6799999999998s)]
*  And we credit the president as we should for the impressive legislative successes, [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1522.7199999999998s)]
*  historic successes that the president has had the first two years. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1529.7199999999998s)]
*  But in part, it was because of Ron's leadership, incredible leadership, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1533.04s)]
*  that we were able to get that done. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1537.72s)]
*  So again, don't have anything to share with you all today on this front. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1540.16s)]
*  But again, Ron has been an incredible leader these past two years. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1545.68s)]
*  Just an out of context praise for Ron. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1550.4s)]
*  And then I'll let my colleagues follow up on that one. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1552.84s)]
*  I think finally on the final part. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1559.84s)]
*  I'm sure they won't be shy to follow up. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1561.6s)]
*  On the FBI search of the president's home on Friday, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1563.08s)]
*  the president, when the initial batch of documents were reported a couple of weeks [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1566.12s)]
*  ago, said he was surprised that they were classified documents [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1569.4399999999998s)]
*  down at the Penn-Biden Center. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1572.28s)]
*  Was he surprised that there was classified material found at his home on [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1573.7199999999998s)]
*  Friday, as well as the prior discovery at his house a few weeks ago? [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  So look, again, there's gonna be a lot of questions on this. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1579.84s)]
*  I know my colleagues from the White House Counsel's office has been pretty diligent [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1583.24s)]
*  on taking questions these last couple of days. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1588.24s)]
*  There's going to be a call in less than an hour or so from my White House [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1590.48s)]
*  Counsel office. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1595.3999999999999s)]
*  And look, they're going to answer the questions from here. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1596.72s)]
*  Any specifics to the Department of Justice, any specifics [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1601.12s)]
*  to this particular legal matter, I would refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1603.56s)]
*  I'm going to continue to be prudent from here. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1609.56s)]
*  I'm going to continue to be consistent and make sure that those questions go [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1611.48s)]
*  to my colleagues in the White House Counsel's office. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1616.76s)]
*  Another question on the documents. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1620.6399999999999s)]
*  You have said, though, from this podium many, many times over the last two weeks [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1622.8799999999999s)]
*  that this president takes the handling of classified material very seriously. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1626.52s)]
*  And yet, we continue to learn about more documents being found and discovered [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1630.3999999999999s)]
*  at his home, including now some that go back decades to his time in the Senate. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1634.36s)]
*  So why should the American people believe that this president takes classified [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1638.3999999999999s)]
*  material seriously and the handling of it? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1642.6s)]
*  Look, the president, the American people heard from the president directly on this [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1644.96s)]
*  when he was asked by your colleagues at least twice now about how he sees [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1648.52s)]
*  this process. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1654.84s)]
*  And he was very clear with the response of what we're currently seeing. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1655.96s)]
*  And he says, I take this very seriously. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1659.8799999999999s)]
*  He said, I didn't know that the documents were there. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1661.8s)]
*  And look, I think as it relates to the American people [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1665.72s)]
*  and the president standing with the American people, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1669.0s)]
*  it is going to be up to them to decide how they see this president. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1671.72s)]
*  Look, this is a president that came into office. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1676.8s)]
*  Nine million people had lost their jobs. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1678.84s)]
*  The unemployment rate was 6.3%. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1681.2s)]
*  And hundreds of thousands of small businesses had closed their doors. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1683.52s)]
*  And in the past two years, we've created nearly 11 million jobs. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1687.12s)]
*  The unemployment rate is at a record low, at 50 year record low. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1691.76s)]
*  In the last two years were the best years for small businesses [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1696.2s)]
*  applications on record. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1698.72s)]
*  We talked about that last week just from here. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1700.24s)]
*  The president has built the most significant legislative record [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1702.84s)]
*  since LBJ. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1706.04s)]
*  Let's not forget, there's a Chips and Science Act, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1707.28s)]
*  the bipartisan infrastructure legislation. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1709.2s)]
*  I just walked through what he's going to see next week when he's [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1711.0s)]
*  traveling to Baltimore and also New York City, the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1714.04s)]
*  which is going to deal with lowering costs. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1718.8400000000001s)]
*  So the president has been in office for the last two years [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1720.96s)]
*  focusing on the American people. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1724.96s)]
*  And we saw that. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1727.16s)]
*  We saw what the American people had to say during the midterms. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1728.76s)]
*  As it relates, again, as it relates to this, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1731.92s)]
*  as it relates to this ongoing legal matter, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1734.16s)]
*  I would refer you to my colleagues at the White House Council. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1737.16s)]
*  Again, they're going to be speaking with all of you in just less [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1740.72s)]
*  than an hour or so. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1744.48s)]
*  But I just want to ask one more time, because you have been the one [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1745.5600000000002s)]
*  messaging that he takes this seriously. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1747.92s)]
*  You have also been saying over and over again [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1749.4s)]
*  that you are cooperating fully with this investigation. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  That hasn't changed, Mary. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1753.68s)]
*  But given that, why then did it take several searches and the FBI [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1754.96s)]
*  coming in to uncover the full extent of the documents that he says? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1759.0s)]
*  I understand your question. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1762.48s)]
*  I've said many times, the president has said many times, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1764.6s)]
*  he takes this very seriously. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1767.3999999999999s)]
*  You've heard directly from him. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1768.7199999999998s)]
*  You just said that his team is cooperating fully. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1770.52s)]
*  And just want to add, and you heard from his team, [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1773.8799999999999s)]
*  that the FBI was invited into the president's home. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1777.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond that. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1782.08s)]
*  That was in the statement that was released on Saturday. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1783.76s)]
*  Again, these are questions that have been answered from here, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1786.52s)]
*  has been answered for my colleagues. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1792.44s)]
*  Anything else, my colleague is going to speak to all of you [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1794.2s)]
*  in just a few minutes or for moments. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1797.4s)]
*  And you can ask more in detail questions. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1799.56s)]
*  You just said the president said that he did not know [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1801.76s)]
*  the documents were there. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1804.8s)]
*  I'm not actually sure he has said that clearly. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1805.76s)]
*  Are you saying the president did not know that? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1808.1200000000001s)]
*  Well, he said he was surprised. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1809.28s)]
*  He said he was surprised. [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1810.72s)]
*  He said he was surprised. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1812.64s)]
*  I'm just going to leave it there, and I'm going to refer you [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1813.64s)]
*  to the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1815.76s)]
*  I'm just repeating what he said. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1817.68s)]
*  I want to remember what you just said. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1819.0s)]
*  You said he did not know the documents were there. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1820.0800000000002s)]
*  He said he was surprised that the documents were there. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1821.36s)]
*  He said that and that he takes this very seriously. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1824.24s)]
*  That's what I want to make sure that the American people [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1827.0s)]
*  understand. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1829.8799999999999s)]
*  And I just refer to- [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1830.52s)]
*  The American people might question that. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1831.24s)]
*  Given that you keep every few days, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1833.0s)]
*  it seems we are finding that more documents have [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1835.1599999999999s)]
*  been found in his house. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1836.8s)]
*  What I'm telling you is what the president has said, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1838.8s)]
*  which is he takes this very seriously. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1841.0s)]
*  I will refer you to detailed explanations [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1843.32s)]
*  from statements that have come from his personal lawyer. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1846.6s)]
*  Again, anything further on this, my colleague [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1850.68s)]
*  is going to be taking your questions, Mary. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1853.52s)]
*  In the 4 o'clock hour, I would refer you to them. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1855.6000000000001s)]
*  Has Ron Klain told the president that he's [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1859.28s)]
*  leaving, planning to leave? [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1861.5600000000002s)]
*  Don't have anything further to share. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1863.24s)]
*  And just to be very clear, Ron Klain [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1865.8400000000001s)]
*  is still very much the chief of staff. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1868.2s)]
*  He is still here with us. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1869.88s)]
*  Just don't have anything to share. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1871.48s)]
*  Does the president think Jeff Zeitz would [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1872.88s)]
*  be a good chief of staff? [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1874.5600000000002s)]
*  What about Steve Holland? [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1875.76s)]
*  Steve Holland, do you want to be chief of staff? [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1881.0s)]
*  I hear a name. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1883.8799999999999s)]
*  Someone just called you out as chief of staff material. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1884.92s)]
*  It was popped up on Friday. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1889.64s)]
*  When will Speaker McCarthy visit the president? [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1891.28s)]
*  So don't have a meeting to share with all of you at this time. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1894.24s)]
*  The president is looking forward to sitting down [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1898.76s)]
*  with Speaker McCarthy to talk about an array of issues. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1901.6s)]
*  This is normal, right? [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1906.64s)]
*  During a new Congress, it is normal for the president [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1907.64s)]
*  to sit down with the speaker to talk about how [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1910.0800000000002s)]
*  they can work together. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1912.5200000000002s)]
*  You heard the president say this right after the midterms, [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1913.5600000000002s)]
*  how he wants to work in a bipartisan way with members [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1916.72s)]
*  of Congress to deliver, to continue [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1920.3400000000001s)]
*  to deliver on the successes that he has had this first two [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1922.64s)]
*  years in good faith. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1925.5600000000002s)]
*  He wants to do this in good faith. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1927.0800000000002s)]
*  So once there's a meeting locked in, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1929.3200000000002s)]
*  we certainly will share that with all of you. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1931.16s)]
*  Go ahead, Phil. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1933.0800000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Greene. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1933.92s)]
*  On the debt limit, Senator Manchin today [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1934.92s)]
*  called the White House position under negotiations [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1936.92s)]
*  quote, not responsible. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1938.92s)]
*  Yesterday, I think he called it a mistake. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1940.0s)]
*  I understand where your position is. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1941.8400000000001s)]
*  Is there any concern that Democrats not [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1943.38s)]
*  siding with that position could undercut the effort you guys [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1945.72s)]
*  are trying to put into place over the next four months? [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1948.44s)]
*  So just let me look. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1950.68s)]
*  Lowering the deficit has always been a top priority [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1951.8400000000001s)]
*  for this president. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1955.5200000000002s)]
*  As you know, he's lowered the deficit in record fashion [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1956.3200000000002s)]
*  at $1.7 trillion under his presidency. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1959.2800000000002s)]
*  And he has said, he's always said, [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1962.46s)]
*  he is happy to talk to anyone who [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1963.84s)]
*  wants to deal with that in a responsible way. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1966.28s)]
*  But preventing the fault is a separate matter. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1970.32s)]
*  That is a separate matter within itself. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1973.1599999999999s)]
*  It is a basic responsibility for Congress. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1975.56s)]
*  We've said this over and over and again, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1978.1999999999998s)]
*  and I'll continue to say this. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1979.84s)]
*  And it's a responsibility that Congress [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1981.32s)]
*  has to the American people. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1983.36s)]
*  And so it must be done without conditions, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1985.28s)]
*  even as they've pushed for tax giveaways to the rich. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1988.24s)]
*  Republicans want to cut Social Security. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1993.16s)]
*  They want to cut Medicare and other critical programs. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1995.0400000000002s)]
*  And let's not forget, these critical programs [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1997.88s)]
*  have already been paid into. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=1999.76s)]
*  These are programs for veterans, for seniors, and taxpayers. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2001.44s)]
*  This is what they're talking about taking away [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2004.68s)]
*  from these really critical programs for critical groups [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2008.3200000000002s)]
*  here. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2012.44s)]
*  So President Biden will never allow Republicans [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2013.0s)]
*  to cut benefits that our hardworking Americans have [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2016.2s)]
*  earned. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2020.0s)]
*  This is what they have earned. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2020.5s)]
*  But I'll also note, as it relates to Senator Manchin [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2022.4s)]
*  and to your question, Phil, he agreed on the need [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2025.1200000000001s)]
*  to protect Social Security. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2028.3600000000001s)]
*  He agreed on the need to protect Medicare [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2029.68s)]
*  and called on Republicans to take cuts to those programs [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2032.0400000000002s)]
*  off, this is quote, off the board right now. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2036.2800000000002s)]
*  And so just want to make that very, very clear as well. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2040.0s)]
*  Are you actively asking Democrats not [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2042.4s)]
*  to break ranks on this issue? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2044.92s)]
*  We've been very clear. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2046.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2047.76s)]
*  I mean, we've been very public about this. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2048.56s)]
*  You guys have all covered what we have said from here [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2051.24s)]
*  about how we see this process moving forward. [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2053.7599999999998s)]
*  It should be done without conditions. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2056.68s)]
*  This is something that has been done 78 times [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2059.2s)]
*  when we were talking about lifting the debt ceiling since 1960, [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2061.8399999999997s)]
*  I believe. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2067.4399999999996s)]
*  This is not unusual. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2067.9599999999996s)]
*  It was done three times in the past administration [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2068.9599999999996s)]
*  under Donald Trump. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2072.6s)]
*  So this is nothing unusual. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2073.9199999999996s)]
*  This is something that should be done without conditions. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2075.2799999999997s)]
*  And we should not be taking hostage key programs [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2077.72s)]
*  that the American people really earned and care about. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2081.8799999999997s)]
*  Social Security, Medicare, it should not [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2085.64s)]
*  be put into a hostage situation. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2087.6s)]
*  And again, the president is going to continue [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2090.8399999999997s)]
*  to fight for those programs. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2092.68s)]
*  And we're going to be very clear about how we see how Congress [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2094.8399999999997s)]
*  should move forward. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2097.7599999999998s)]
*  Thanks, Fran. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2099.48s)]
*  The president said last week that he has no regrets [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2100.3999999999996s)]
*  when it comes to the handling of classified documents. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2102.6s)]
*  Why doesn't he have regrets given that classified documents [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2105.64s)]
*  keep turning up? [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2109.08s)]
*  I talked about this last week. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2110.48s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2112.16s)]
*  Again, I would refer you to the White House Council [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2114.8799999999997s)]
*  for anything further on this legal matter. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2117.12s)]
*  Again, I spoke to this yesterday. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2121.6s)]
*  Last week, pardon me, last Friday, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2123.92s)]
*  I'm just not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2125.3599999999997s)]
*  It's about his statement from last week. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  I understand. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2129.24s)]
*  And I said I'm not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2129.7599999999998s)]
*  And I think it speaks for itself. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2133.0s)]
*  I'm not going to go into what he meant or didn't meant. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2135.32s)]
*  He laid it out. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2139.0800000000004s)]
*  He said it to all of you when he was out, [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2139.88s)]
*  I believe, in California, when he answered one [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2143.8s)]
*  of your colleagues' question or when he addressed [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2145.96s)]
*  this particular matter. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2148.32s)]
*  I'm just not going to go into what he meant or didn't mean. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2149.6000000000004s)]
*  But going back to what Mary was asking, [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2152.0800000000004s)]
*  when the president says that he takes classified material [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2153.84s)]
*  and the handling of it very seriously, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2157.44s)]
*  this weekend, top Senate Democrats who [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2159.6400000000003s)]
*  have known him for decades described this situation [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2161.6400000000003s)]
*  as an unacceptable and completely irresponsible. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2164.84s)]
*  What's the disconnect here? [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2167.56s)]
*  They also said, I may add, if I may add, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2169.04s)]
*  that the president is handling this [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2171.4s)]
*  in the appropriate fashion, that the president and his team [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2173.92s)]
*  has been completely complying completely [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2176.6000000000004s)]
*  with the investigation. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2180.04s)]
*  They also said that. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2181.54s)]
*  And so I will leave it up to their comments up to them. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2183.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what they have said. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2187.8s)]
*  But they also said that piece, too. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2189.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think it's important to note [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2191.44s)]
*  that they believe that the president has handled this [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2193.0s)]
*  properly as well. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2194.96s)]
*  Who's paying the president's private attorney [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2195.76s)]
*  on this matter? [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2198.28s)]
*  I mean, it's his private attorney. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2199.2s)]
*  So I would leave it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2201.28s)]
*  I would just say it's his private attorney. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2202.68s)]
*  Any questions, anything in particular to this, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2206.0s)]
*  I would ask the White House Counsel Office. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2208.4s)]
*  We've asked his private attorney at least four times, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2210.4s)]
*  and they haven't given us an answer. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2213.24s)]
*  We deserve to know whether he's paying for it or he's [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2216.16s)]
*  prepared. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2218.52s)]
*  I totally understand, Nancy. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2219.4s)]
*  My colleague is going to be speaking to you momentarily. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2221.32s)]
*  You can ask that question in that conversation, [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2224.0400000000004s)]
*  on the record conversation with all of you. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2226.44s)]
*  On Friday when we were here, you were asked about the president [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2229.96s)]
*  going to Rehoboth and if that had anything [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2233.2000000000003s)]
*  to do with searches. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2235.32s)]
*  And you declined to answer that. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2237.1600000000003s)]
*  Did you know Friday there was a search going [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2238.88s)]
*  on at the president's home? [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2240.96s)]
*  So I'll say this. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2242.1200000000003s)]
*  And I think I said this on Friday as well. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2243.4s)]
*  They go to Delaware almost every weekend. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2246.1200000000003s)]
*  We put out guidance last Monday. [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2248.44s)]
*  As you know, Monday night that they would be [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2250.68s)]
*  spending the weekend in Rehoboth. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2252.72s)]
*  So it was indeed pre-planned. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2254.12s)]
*  So just want to put that out there. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2256.24s)]
*  And I'll just mention what was said in the statement just [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2257.8399999999997s)]
*  on Saturday, which is the DOJ requested [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2265.16s)]
*  that the search not be made public in advance in line [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2267.8799999999997s)]
*  with its standard procedures. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2271.48s)]
*  And we did adhere to that. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2273.16s)]
*  As you could understand, that is something [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2275.24s)]
*  that we are going to take very seriously. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2277.04s)]
*  And it was, again, a request from DOJ for us [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2279.7599999999998s)]
*  to make sure that we did not make that public in advance. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2283.48s)]
*  Should we anticipate other searches are possible? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2288.04s)]
*  That part I would definitely refer you [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2290.56s)]
*  to the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2293.08s)]
*  More broadly, given the fact that classified documents [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2294.4399999999996s)]
*  and their handling have been an issue, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2298.56s)]
*  has the White House counsel put out any guidance [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2300.7599999999998s)]
*  to staff members here who have the opportunity [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2304.24s)]
*  to interact with classified materials [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2307.68s)]
*  to just reaffirm how that should be done? [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2309.7999999999997s)]
*  Has there been any follow-up on proper procedures for staffers? [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2312.44s)]
*  Not the president, not the circumstance. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2316.92s)]
*  I understand the question. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2319.48s)]
*  Again, you're going to have an opportunity [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2320.7599999999998s)]
*  to ask that very question to the White House Counsel's Office [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2322.4s)]
*  about if they're going to, what's their next steps [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2325.44s)]
*  as it relates to staff? [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2328.12s)]
*  That's something that's better for them to answer, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2329.48s)]
*  and they'll be speaking to all of you momentarily. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2331.56s)]
*  Katakia. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2333.7599999999998s)]
*  I wanted to ask about the president of Turkey today [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2335.92s)]
*  said that he would not support Sweden's bid to join NATO. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2339.2000000000003s)]
*  Obviously, the US supports that. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2343.56s)]
*  Is there concern that that bid could fall through? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2345.6800000000003s)]
*  So just a couple of things that I want to make sure. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2348.76s)]
*  I want to echo the comments of the Swedish prime minister [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2351.2400000000002s)]
*  who said burning books that are holy to many [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2354.4s)]
*  is a deeply respectful act, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2358.7200000000003s)]
*  and what is legal is not necessarily appropriate. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2360.44s)]
*  As we have said before, [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2363.56s)]
*  Finland and Sweden are ready to be NATO allies. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2364.8s)]
*  Both are members of NATO's Partnership for Peace [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2367.7200000000003s)]
*  and NATO's Enhanced Opportunities Partnership. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2371.0800000000004s)]
*  Their militaries work seamlessly with alliance forces. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2373.84s)]
*  Finland and Sweden have already taken concrete steps [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2377.7200000000003s)]
*  to fulfill the commitments they made [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2382.48s)]
*  under the trilateral memorandum of agreement with Turkey, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2384.32s)]
*  signed on the margins of the NATO summit in Madrid, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2388.36s)]
*  including substantial strengthening, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2391.76s)]
*  substantially strengthening their bilateral cooperation [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2394.12s)]
*  with Turkey on key security concerns. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2397.2799999999997s)]
*  We continue to expect that NATO will formally welcome [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2400.44s)]
*  Finland and Sweden as members. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2403.56s)]
*  This will enhance their security, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2405.64s)]
*  as well as that of the Euro-Atlantic region. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2407.2799999999997s)]
*  As their membership process continues, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2410.56s)]
*  the United States is fully committed [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2412.2s)]
*  to Finland's and Sweden's accession. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2413.7999999999997s)]
*  The strength of that support can be seen in our Senate's [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2416.16s)]
*  overwhelming bipartisan vote for their membership [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2419.7999999999997s)]
*  just weeks after their application was submitted. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2422.44s)]
*  Did you mean disrespectful or respectful? [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2426.2400000000002s)]
*  Disrespectful act. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2430.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you for declaring it. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2431.76s)]
*  Deeply disrespectful act. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2432.7200000000003s)]
*  I just want one more question. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2434.0s)]
*  There's a proposal right now in Congress [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2435.36s)]
*  to tie the debt limit to GDP. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2436.96s)]
*  Would the White House entertain anything along those lines? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2439.88s)]
*  So it's basically what I just laid out. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2443.2400000000002s)]
*  When it comes to dealing with the deficit, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2445.52s)]
*  it's something that the president has made his top priority. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2448.16s)]
*  As I mentioned earlier, $1.7 trillion [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2450.44s)]
*  was the record that the president was able to lower [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2452.56s)]
*  the deficit under his administration. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2457.76s)]
*  He takes any ideas that come to him in a responsible way. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2461.16s)]
*  He's happy to listen. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2464.88s)]
*  But again, this is a separate matter. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2466.44s)]
*  When you're thinking about preventing default [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2468.08s)]
*  is a separate matter. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2470.2000000000003s)]
*  And so he believes it should not be done. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2471.84s)]
*  It should be done, pardon me, without conditions. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2474.2000000000003s)]
*  And it should be done in a bipartisan way, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2477.0s)]
*  as it's been done many times before. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2478.7200000000003s)]
*  I mentioned the number 78. [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2480.28s)]
*  That's been done 78 times since 1960, three times [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2482.1200000000003s)]
*  under the last president. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2485.4s)]
*  Again, it should be done without conditions. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2486.76s)]
*  And that's where we stand on that. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2488.6000000000004s)]
*  OK. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2490.0400000000004s)]
*  Can I ask a follow up to the question about Turkey? [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2490.5600000000004s)]
*  Have you all spoken with Turkey since they [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2492.48s)]
*  expressed this public outrage? [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2494.96s)]
*  I don't have a conversation to read out to you at this time. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2496.2400000000002s)]
*  I know that we've been asked if we see them [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2500.84s)]
*  as reliable partners. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2504.44s)]
*  I was asked this last week. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2505.6000000000004s)]
*  And my answer to that was yes. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2506.76s)]
*  I want to ask you a follow up, actually, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2509.04s)]
*  about this new members reception that is coming up. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2510.44s)]
*  Do you have any guidance on how many new members [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2513.04s)]
*  the president intends to have? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2515.32s)]
*  And a follow up to that, actually. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2516.7200000000003s)]
*  Yes, no. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2518.04s)]
*  It's a good question. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2518.6000000000004s)]
*  Don't have any numbers to confirm to you at this time. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2519.52s)]
*  Again, I would have to go back to the Office of Ledge Affairs. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2523.36s)]
*  As you know, that process has run through them. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2526.1200000000003s)]
*  I don't have a number to share at this time [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2528.32s)]
*  on who has confirmed to attend. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2530.1200000000003s)]
*  And is George Santos invited? [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2531.52s)]
*  Again, I do. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2533.36s)]
*  I love how everybody laughed at that. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2534.4s)]
*  Well, look, as you know, it's an event for the new Congress. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2543.2400000000002s)]
*  So everyone is invited who is part of the new Congress. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2550.7200000000003s)]
*  I just don't have a confirmation on who [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2553.44s)]
*  is attending at this time. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2556.44s)]
*  But I understand the question. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2557.84s)]
*  Just don't have that. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2559.12s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2559.7200000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2560.2400000000002s)]
*  I hope you have an answer for this one. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2560.7200000000003s)]
*  And the debt ceiling crisis. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2562.44s)]
*  There are so many different agencies [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2565.4s)]
*  and different social programs that are impacted. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2568.52s)]
*  But I want to ask you this. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2572.2400000000002s)]
*  We're watching this once again, mass shooting. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2573.4s)]
*  Are there programs right now that are in jeopardy [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2576.7200000000003s)]
*  because of the debt ceiling that are targeted on gun violence, [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2579.64s)]
*  mass shootings, targeted on trying to fix this gun crisis [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2584.56s)]
*  in the nation? [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2591.2799999999997s)]
*  Look, kind of to your first question, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2592.48s)]
*  one of the things that we have called out [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2596.44s)]
*  is Republicans threatening to default, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2598.68s)]
*  to force cuts on social security, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2602.44s)]
*  to force cuts on Medicare. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2604.12s)]
*  And that is indeed programs that could be at risk, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2606.2799999999997s)]
*  which is why we continue to call this out, which is why we have [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2609.88s)]
*  should not be using this as a political football, which [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2613.1200000000003s)]
*  is why we have said that since 1960, 78 times, [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2615.92s)]
*  this has been done in a bipartisan way. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2621.0s)]
*  And it is the basic responsibility of Congress [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2623.7200000000003s)]
*  to deal with this issue because there are [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2626.5200000000004s)]
*  programs that are incredibly important to the American people [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2628.96s)]
*  that would be in jeopardy if this is allowed. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2632.88s)]
*  There's a couple of validators that I just want to read out to you. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2634.76s)]
*  Mark Zandi, Moody's Analytics, said, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2638.48s)]
*  financial markets and the economy will crater. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2641.16s)]
*  Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2644.2s)]
*  that many of you speak with, a default would be catastrophic. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2646.48s)]
*  It would mean higher borrowing costs forever. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2650.68s)]
*  And lastly, Wendy Elliburg from Brookings, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2653.24s)]
*  it's playing a game with the US economy and people's lives [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2655.6s)]
*  that I think is irresponsible. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2658.56s)]
*  So yes, there are programs that will definitely [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2660.46s)]
*  be at risk if this is the direction that Republicans [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2662.7599999999998s)]
*  in the House decide to take. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2667.0s)]
*  Another follow up to this, are there [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2669.0s)]
*  efforts afoot in this White House, up and down Pennsylvania Avenue, [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2672.96s)]
*  to safeguard if there is this crisis that continues to win? [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2676.44s)]
*  For instance, you talked about Social Security checks, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2681.92s)]
*  not just Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and military checks [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2685.56s)]
*  and other items. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2689.48s)]
*  Are you guys working on any kind of process [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2691.16s)]
*  to be a safety net so that the military can get paid, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2694.52s)]
*  so that these checks can come out in the midst of this crisis [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2698.28s)]
*  as you're fighting about raising the debt limit? [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2700.96s)]
*  That is constitutional. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2703.4s)]
*  So look, it's a very good question. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2704.48s)]
*  And you're right, veterans, seniors, our taxpayers, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2705.94s)]
*  if Republicans go down this road, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2711.28s)]
*  they will be the ones who are hurting here. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2713.88s)]
*  We're going to continue to do what you've been seeing us do [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2716.88s)]
*  and hearing us from myself, from this president, which [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2719.8s)]
*  is call this out and say very clearly that we [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2722.46s)]
*  are, we, Congress should get this done without conditions. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2727.04s)]
*  And that's what you're going to continue to hear from us. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2731.84s)]
*  Are there any meetings, any conversations about Plan B, Plan C, Plan D, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2734.32s)]
*  if this does go into that moment where checks are going up? [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2740.32s)]
*  I hear your question. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2743.48s)]
*  I'm saying there's not, there shouldn't be a Plan A, Plan B, Plan C. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2744.32s)]
*  There should not be. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2747.36s)]
*  This should be done without conditions. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2748.72s)]
*  We should not be negotiating around this. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2750.92s)]
*  This is, again, the last president under the Trump administration [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2753.72s)]
*  was done three times in a bipartisan way. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2757.04s)]
*  So again, we're going to continue to talk about this. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2760.6s)]
*  We're going to be very clear and continue to have [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2762.9199999999996s)]
*  conversation with Congress. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2766.16s)]
*  We are talking to Congress. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2767.2799999999997s)]
*  I talked about this last week, how the Office of Legit Affairs [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2768.8799999999997s)]
*  has been doing outreach to new members of Congress in particular [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2771.8799999999997s)]
*  to let them know who is their point of contact, what conversations, [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2775.7599999999998s)]
*  opening up for conversations on things that [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2780.7599999999998s)]
*  are important to them. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2783.0s)]
*  And so we are having those conversations, [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2784.24s)]
*  and we'll continue to engage with Congress. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2785.96s)]
*  But again, this should be done without conditions 78 times [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2789.52s)]
*  that Congress has been able to do this. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2794.44s)]
*  And it is their basic responsibility, their basic responsibility. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2796.4s)]
*  Karine? [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2801.12s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2803.32s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2804.96s)]
*  Thank you, Karine. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2805.64s)]
*  Tomorrow, Democratic congressional leaders [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2807.08s)]
*  will be coming to the White House. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2808.96s)]
*  What does the president hope to achieve? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2810.36s)]
*  And will the debt ceiling be one of the agenda items discussed? [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2812.08s)]
*  Look, a range of issues, as you know, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2815.16s)]
*  this is how these conversations happen. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2817.3199999999997s)]
*  There's always a long agenda of items [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2819.68s)]
*  that both sides want to talk about, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2823.16s)]
*  not going to get ahead of what the conversation is going to be [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2825.84s)]
*  or what's going to be actually discussed. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2828.88s)]
*  But the president has said very clearly, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2831.36s)]
*  he said very clearly when it comes to this new Congress, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2833.2799999999997s)]
*  when it comes to moving forward to deliver [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2837.56s)]
*  for the American people, he wants to do this in a bipartisan way. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2839.36s)]
*  He wants to build on the successes that we [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2843.2000000000003s)]
*  have seen the last two years. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2845.7200000000003s)]
*  That has not changed. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2847.0s)]
*  And that's working with Democrats. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2847.96s)]
*  That is really well. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2849.8s)]
*  But we've already mentioned that this [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2850.76s)]
*  is going to be part of a series of meetings that will be happening. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2853.4s)]
*  We've talked about the president looking forward [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2858.08s)]
*  to meeting with Speaker McCarthy. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2860.2400000000002s)]
*  So we've already said that. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2863.1600000000003s)]
*  This is just one of the first of series of meetings. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2865.6s)]
*  But look, again, the president right after historic midterm elections [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2868.6s)]
*  for a Democratic president in 60 years, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2873.7999999999997s)]
*  when you look at how the Senate turned out, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2875.7599999999998s)]
*  when you look at that there wasn't an actual red wave that [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2878.4s)]
*  was being reported on, that he wants to do this [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2881.4s)]
*  and continue moving forward in a bipartisan way. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2884.88s)]
*  That's what the American people wants us to do. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2886.92s)]
*  And so that's always going to be how the president's going [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2890.12s)]
*  to lead into these conversations. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2892.7999999999997s)]
*  And on the energy bill, Secretary Granholm [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2894.4s)]
*  outlined that she doesn't want the US's ability [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2896.56s)]
*  to draw down these strategic oil reserves to be [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2899.32s)]
*  hampered in a time of future crisis. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2902.96s)]
*  But would the administration support a minimum threshold of oil [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2905.08s)]
*  to keep in those reserves for national security purposes? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2910.24s)]
*  Look, I'm not going to get into any policy decisions [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2913.04s)]
*  that the Department of Energy is going to be making. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2915.4s)]
*  You heard directly from the Energy Secretary [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2917.6s)]
*  from here, right here on the podium moments ago. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2920.32s)]
*  I'm just not going to get ahead of any potential policy making. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2922.4s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2926.0400000000004s)]
*  The president's scheduled to go to Camp David this weekend, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2926.5600000000004s)]
*  just to clarify. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2928.88s)]
*  Should we read anything into that? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2929.76s)]
*  And does he have full access to his homes right now [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2932.96s)]
*  in both Wilmington and Roeville? [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2935.92s)]
*  I would refer you to the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2938.0800000000004s)]

*  you can't say much about the chief of staff, [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2941.48s)]
*  but can you say whether any women or people of color [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2943.6000000000004s)]

*  Again, we don't have an announcement. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2948.0s)]
*  We have not made an announcement. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2949.44s)]

*  We haven't made an announcement and don't [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2953.76s)]
*  have anything to share on that front at this time. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2957.32s)]

*  A follow-up on this story on the New York Times this weekend [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2962.2400000000002s)]
*  about Russia's agent could be directing [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2966.84s)]
*  firebomb groups to make bombs in Spain. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2971.88s)]
*  Is the White House concerned that Russia [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2974.6400000000003s)]
*  could carry out terrorist attacks in European countries [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2976.44s)]
*  that are supporting Ukraine? [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2980.28s)]
*  As you're asking about the letter bombs [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2982.7200000000003s)]
*  that has been reported on, look, I'm [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2985.2000000000003s)]
*  not going to get into intelligence matters [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2986.96s)]
*  or any ongoing investigation. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2989.48s)]
*  But there are a couple of general points [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2991.44s)]
*  that I would like to make. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2993.52s)]
*  First, we take extraordinarily seriously [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2994.84s)]
*  the safety and security of our personnel abroad, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=2997.1600000000003s)]
*  including at Embassy Madrid. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3000.36s)]
*  That means we're doing everything possible [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3002.4s)]
*  to work with Spanish partners to figure out [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3004.36s)]
*  what happened here and prevent similar threats in the future. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3006.6800000000003s)]
*  Second, we've offered the Spanish full cooperation [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3009.64s)]
*  and support in their ongoing investigations. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3012.68s)]
*  And they know the importance to us of this matter. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3015.3599999999997s)]
*  And importance they, of course, share, obviously. [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3020.8399999999997s)]
*  The Spanish are good partners. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3024.56s)]
*  And we're appreciative for the seriousness [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3026.0s)]
*  which they are taking this and responding to it. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3029.3599999999997s)]
*  Again, not going to go into any more details when it comes [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3033.04s)]
*  to an intelligence matter. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3036.3599999999997s)]
*  Another question about Brazil. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3038.36s)]
*  The attacks in Brazil is linked to also far-right groups [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3040.32s)]
*  here in the United States. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3043.56s)]
*  Members of Congress here are already [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3045.8s)]
*  asking the administration to share information [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3047.32s)]
*  on either some of the planning were actually taking place here. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3050.1600000000003s)]
*  Is the administration sharing information [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3054.6400000000003s)]
*  with the Brazilian authorities about that? [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3056.48s)]
*  And is concerned that the attacks originating here [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3058.28s)]
*  and what could be due to counter that from happening [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3061.7200000000003s)]
*  from these kind of attacks being planned here, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3066.52s)]
*  either in Brazil and other countries? [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3069.2s)]
*  I totally understand the question. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3071.24s)]
*  I want to be very mindful on any intelligence matters. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3072.68s)]
*  I would, and I don't want to comment [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3075.64s)]
*  on diplomatic discussions here. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3077.8s)]
*  So just going to leave it there. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3079.84s)]
*  Can I just add one more about that? [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3082.04s)]
*  Is the White House considering sanctions, [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3084.72s)]
*  imposing sanctions on individuals or corporations [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3087.6s)]
*  involved in the January 8 attacks in Brazil? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3091.32s)]
*  Again, don't have anything to share on sanctions. [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3094.28s)]
*  Totally understand your question, [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3097.52s)]
*  but don't have anything to share on that piece at this time. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3099.0s)]
*  OK, go ahead. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3102.5600000000004s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3103.52s)]
*  I have some African questions today. [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3104.36s)]
*  First of all, how does the White House [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3106.0s)]
*  feel about the Russian foreign minister being in Pretoria, [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3107.48s)]
*  being warmly welcomed, and preparing [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3110.52s)]
*  to host naval drills with South Africa together with China? [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3112.92s)]
*  So we have the United States has concerns about any country, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3117.88s)]
*  as we've said before, country exercising with Russia [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3122.0s)]
*  while Russia wages a brutal war against Ukraine. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3126.16s)]
*  We've said this before. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3128.68s)]
*  We've been consistent on this. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3129.72s)]
*  Of course, every participating country [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3131.48s)]
*  will make their own decision. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3133.44s)]
*  But again, we have said this before. [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3135.84s)]
*  We do have concerns. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3137.76s)]
*  Have you pressed this to Pretoria? [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3139.2s)]
*  I don't have any conversations to read out, [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3140.88s)]
*  but we've been very, very consistent as it relates to this. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3143.4s)]
*  Other Russian involvement on the continent. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3146.72s)]
*  On Friday's announcement that Wagner [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3149.32s)]
*  has a new designation as a terrorist group, I believe, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3151.6800000000003s)]
*  what are the consequences for African governments [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3156.0s)]
*  that work with them? [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3158.04s)]
*  Mozambique, Mali, so on and so forth. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3160.28s)]
*  Is that going to affect the amount of cooperation [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3162.0s)]
*  between the US and those countries? [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3164.48s)]
*  And is that something maybe that Secretary Yellen [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3165.96s)]
*  might be talking about with those leaders? [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3167.96s)]
*  I will leave any conversation that Secretary Yellen [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3170.52s)]
*  is having with leaders or has had with leaders to her [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3173.0800000000004s)]
*  to speak to it and to her office to speak to. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3175.6400000000003s)]
*  Look, we've been very clear about our concerns, [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3178.04s)]
*  especially as Russia, as we have said many times, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3182.44s)]
*  is doing this brutal war against Ukraine. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3185.56s)]
*  But I'm not going to go beyond that. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3190.64s)]
*  I'll come down. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3194.88s)]
*  Thanks, Irene, on the economy. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3195.92s)]
*  So more companies are announcing layoffs. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3198.0s)]
*  We're seeing retail sales drop off for two months in a row now, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3200.44s)]
*  and inflation is back to 40-year highs. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3204.44s)]
*  Is this the stable growth that you've been talking about? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3207.04s)]
*  If not, when does that stable growth get here? [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3209.32s)]
*  Well, we've been very, very clear. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3211.4s)]
*  And when you think about inflation, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3212.96s)]
*  it has been a look at the CPI data that came out recently, [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3215.36s)]
*  PPI data that came out recently. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3218.32s)]
*  We have seen that inflation has been going down [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3220.24s)]
*  for the past six months. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3224.32s)]
*  And that is because of the work that we have, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3225.88s)]
*  that this president has been doing since he walked [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3228.6s)]
*  into the administration focusing on crises, right? [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3230.64s)]
*  Focusing on COVID and making sure [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3234.16s)]
*  that there was a comprehensive way to deal with COVID [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3237.3599999999997s)]
*  and making sure people got shots in arms, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3240.3599999999997s)]
*  making sure that the American Rescue Plan was passed, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3242.16s)]
*  that was only voted by Democrats in Congress. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3244.96s)]
*  And those actions that he has taken [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3249.64s)]
*  has helped deal with the economy, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3251.3999999999996s)]
*  has helped actually create 11 million jobs, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3253.56s)]
*  has made sure that manufacturing jobs, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3257.2799999999997s)]
*  750,000 manufacturing jobs have been created here. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3259.7599999999998s)]
*  Look, we are still seeing transition [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3263.08s)]
*  to a stable and steady growth. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3265.2s)]
*  That is what we are seeing when we look at the data. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3267.2799999999997s)]
*  And look, yes, there are layoffs that you're asking me about. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3270.68s)]
*  And we previously said on the broader economy, [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3274.96s)]
*  layoffs remain near record lows [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3278.08s)]
*  according to job opening data. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3280.08s)]
*  So we're looking at the data [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3281.88s)]
*  and this is what the data has been telling us. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3283.64s)]
*  And also let's not forget, unemployment is down by, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3286.7599999999998s)]
*  is the lowest that we have seen it in 50 years. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3291.0s)]
*  And so again, this is an economic policy, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3293.96s)]
*  an economic plan that is working. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3297.16s)]
*  And a lot of it is because the president [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3299.44s)]
*  has taken bold steps. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3301.6s)]
*  When can Americans see that stable growth [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3302.76s)]
*  you're talking about? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3304.84s)]
*  Well, I think you look at this, again, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3305.88s)]
*  I pointed to the CPI data, I pointed to the PPI data [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3307.52s)]
*  where we have seen inflation coming down. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3311.08s)]
*  Let's not forget the Inflation Reduction Act [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3313.36s)]
*  where it's going to be implemented [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3315.28s)]
*  in the next couple of months. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3316.96s)]
*  We're going to see Americans actually feel some relief [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3318.44s)]
*  when it comes to prescription drugs, [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3324.2000000000003s)]
*  with Medicare being able to negotiate something [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3326.52s)]
*  that they have not been able to do. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3329.6s)]
*  And so look, the president has taken this very seriously, [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3331.36s)]
*  has an economic plan that's going to help Americans [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3335.4s)]
*  build the economy from the bottom up, middle out, [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3339.08s)]
*  and that's gonna continue to be his focus. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3341.36s)]
*  Look, what we have been saying is we wanna work [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3343.68s)]
*  with Republicans, Democrats, and independents [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3347.48s)]
*  to continue on the successes that we have seen [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3349.64s)]
*  in the last two years, [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3351.9599999999996s)]
*  continue on the historic legislation, [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3353.48s)]
*  implementing those legislation, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3356.52s)]
*  and that's what you're gonna see from this president. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3358.04s)]
*  Go ahead, Peter. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3360.24s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3361.08s)]

*  I can't think. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3376.52s)]
*  Okay. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3377.52s)]
*  President Biden is still intending to run [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3379.44s)]
*  for reelection in 2024, right? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3380.8s)]
*  I'll just repeat what the president said [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3383.28s)]
*  after the midterm election, which is he intends to run. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3385.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna be very careful from here, as you know, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3388.6400000000003s)]
*  because we are covered by the Hatch Act, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3391.32s)]
*  and I'm not gonna speak further to his process. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3393.32s)]
*  Is there a precedent for people running for president [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3395.92s)]
*  after FBI agents search their sock drawer? [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3398.1600000000003s)]
*  Say that one more time. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3401.52s)]

*  Is there a precedent for people running for president [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3403.4s)]
*  after FBI agents? [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3406.76s)]
*  It sounds like you already know [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3408.52s)]
*  that the answer to that question. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3409.52s)]

*  I don't know the answer to that question. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3411.96s)]
*  Here's- [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3413.6s)]
*  An FBI search of a president's residence [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3414.44s)]
*  is a big, big deal. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3416.52s)]
*  Here's what the president's going to focus on. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3417.8s)]
*  He's going to focus on continuing to deliver [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3420.04s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3422.28s)]
*  That's his focus. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3423.44s)]
*  That's what he focuses on every day. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3424.6s)]
*  That's what he's been focusing on the last two years, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3426.36s)]
*  and nothing is going to change that. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3429.2000000000003s)]
*  You think about the bipartisan infrastructure legislation. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3432.0s)]
*  You think about the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3434.32s)]
*  You think about the CHIPS and Science Act. [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3436.52s)]
*  Bi-part- [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3438.56s)]

*  done in a bipartisan way, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3442.36s)]
*  that's what the president wants to do. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3443.68s)]
*  He wants to continue to deliver on his economic plan [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3445.32s)]
*  that is going to build the economy [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3448.92s)]
*  from the bottom up, middle out. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3450.56s)]
*  That is what matters to the president. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3451.88s)]
*  The House Oversight Committee chairman says [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3453.52s)]
*  this document situation has all the makings [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3455.32s)]
*  of a potential cover-up. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3458.44s)]
*  Is President Biden involved in a cover-up? [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3460.24s)]
*  We have been very clear here from this administration, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3465.56s)]
*  the president has been very clear [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3470.04s)]
*  that he takes this very seriously when it comes to classified information, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3473.04s)]
*  when it comes to classified documents, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3479.64s)]
*  and that his team has been fully cooperative with this legal matter. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3481.56s)]
*  Anything else, Peter? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3488.52s)]
*  And this is, and I'm going to be very serious, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3489.72s)]
*  you asked me kind of a question that everybody laughed at, [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3492.24s)]
*  which was an interesting question to ask, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3495.2799999999997s)]
*  but any other underlying questions that you may have, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3498.3599999999997s)]
*  I would refer you to my colleagues, the White House counsel. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3503.08s)]
*  I'm going to continue to be prudent. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3506.6s)]
*  I'm going to continue to be consistent [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3507.8399999999997s)]
*  and refer you to any questions you have there. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3509.72s)]
*  Yeah, Joe. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3513.4399999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Cori. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3514.68s)]
*  We are approaching the statutory deadline for the president [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3515.72s)]
*  to submit his budget to Congress. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3518.48s)]
*  The deadline is the first Monday in February, [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3520.88s)]
*  which is two weeks from today. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3522.76s)]
*  So when does he plan to submit that budget, [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3524.36s)]
*  and when do we do it before that deadline? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3526.28s)]
*  Joey, it's a good question. [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3529.32s)]
*  When we have more to share about that budget process, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3530.56s)]
*  certainly we will have that to share with you. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3533.36s)]
*  The OMB is something that the OMB is working, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3536.64s)]
*  an issue that the OMB director is working very hard on and very closely on. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3540.6s)]
*  Once we have more to share, we certainly will lay that for you, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3545.72s)]
*  Karen. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3548.2s)]
*  Has the president invited the Justice Department [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3549.2s)]
*  to search his home in Rojo, Bistela? [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3551.52s)]
*  I would refer you to the White House counsel's office, [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3553.9199999999996s)]

*  On January 12th, in response to my question, [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3559.2s)]
*  you told me the search is complete, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3562.24s)]
*  he, the president, is confident in this process. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3564.52s)]
*  But since then, the searches have continued, [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3567.6s)]
*  more documents have found. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3570.0s)]
*  Is the president still confident in this process [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3571.7999999999997s)]
*  and how his lawyers have carried out the search for material in his residence? [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3576.4s)]
*  He's confident in this process. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3581.2000000000003s)]
*  And my colleague has talked about this. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3584.32s)]
*  This is an ongoing process. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3586.2400000000002s)]
*  And we've continued to provide the information that we've had at the time. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3588.7200000000003s)]

*  I would refer you to the White House counsel's office. [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3599.84s)]
*  And a non-process question, then. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3601.6s)]
*  We had a poll with Ipsos, ABC News Ipsos, [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3603.64s)]
*  that was taken before the most recent items were discovered [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3606.16s)]
*  that found that 64 percent of Americans believe the president [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3609.4s)]
*  acted inappropriately in the way he handled classified files. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3612.0s)]
*  How worried is the White House that this issue [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3616.4s)]
*  is hurting the president's trustworthiness in the eyes of Americans? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3619.12s)]

*  And that's what he has done. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3637.84s)]
*  And I've laid out the historic pieces of legislation [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3639.0400000000004s)]

*  a rabbit hole or go into details or thoughts about polls. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3660.84s)]

*  about what our message is to the American people [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3669.5600000000004s)]
*  and continue to have that healthy back and forth [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3672.6800000000003s)]
*  and talk about our policies, talk about what the president is doing, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3675.8s)]
*  again, every day with the vice president, with his team, [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3679.92s)]
*  to make sure that we deal with issues that truly, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3682.8s)]
*  truly matter to the American people. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3685.32s)]
*  Just yesterday, you saw, you heard from the vice president [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3687.4s)]
*  in Tallahassee who talked about an issue that mattered to the American people. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3690.36s)]
*  We saw that coming out of the midterms, which [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3694.36s)]
*  is making sure that women's rights were being protected. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3697.32s)]
*  When you think about Roe, yesterday it would have been 50 years of Roe, [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3700.6s)]
*  which was a constitutional right for Americans. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3704.76s)]
*  And so that's what Americans want to continue to see us do, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3707.6800000000003s)]
*  fight for their rights, continue to deliver in a way that they can feel it. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3710.56s)]
*  When it comes to gas prices, bringing those prices down. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3716.08s)]
*  When it comes to health care costs, bringing those costs down. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3718.68s)]
*  And that's really going to be our focus. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3722.64s)]
*  Go ahead, Phil. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3724.56s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3725.56s)]
*  When you and the White House and the president [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3726.64s)]
*  all say that the president takes these classified documents very seriously, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3728.96s)]
*  without commenting on the ongoing legal issue, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3732.8399999999997s)]
*  what would you point us to that would demonstrate that seriousness? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3736.24s)]
*  I'm going to really refer you to the White House Counsel's Office. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3741.12s)]
*  I am. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3744.3999999999996s)]
*  I am. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3745.16s)]
*  So the president continues to say he takes us seriously, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3746.64s)]
*  and you can't demonstrate how he takes us seriously. [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3749.0s)]
*  Let me just finish my answer. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3751.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to refer you to the White House Counsel's Office, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3753.7599999999998s)]
*  and I'm going to refer you to the statements that you've [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3756.24s)]
*  received from his personal lawyer. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3759.56s)]
*  I'm going to refer you to the 45 minutes of conversation, of back and forth, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3762.64s)]
*  that my colleague has had with all of you last week. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3767.3199999999997s)]
*  He's about to do another one where you can ask questions [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3769.7999999999997s)]
*  about this particular legal matter. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3772.7599999999998s)]
*  Again, that's where this belongs. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3776.16s)]
*  That's where I'm going to refer you to. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3778.0s)]
*  But again, you've seen the statements. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3780.04s)]
*  You've heard from the president a couple of times. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3782.04s)]
*  You've heard from his personal lawyer. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3784.12s)]
*  You've heard from the White House Counsel's Office, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3785.52s)]
*  and that's where I'm going to leave it. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3787.72s)]
*  On a different topic, the House has passed bipartisan legislation [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3788.7999999999997s)]
*  that would ban the export of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3793.08s)]
*  to Chinese companies. [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3797.52s)]
*  Given that oil has flowed to China from that reserve [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3799.08s)]
*  during both this administration and the previous one, [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3802.6s)]
*  is that the type of reform that the president would potentially support? [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3805.32s)]
*  So, look, I think this is a little bit of what the secretary [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3809.1200000000003s)]
*  was talking about just moments ago. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3812.6800000000003s)]
*  This bill addresses a non-issue. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3814.6000000000004s)]
*  We're very clear on that. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3817.2400000000002s)]
*  We're focused on advancing legislation [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3818.84s)]
*  that would lower costs for American families, not raise them. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3821.76s)]
*  So I'm just going to leave it there. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3825.1600000000003s)]
*  Thanks, Ben. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3826.76s)]
*  I'm going to go ahead. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3827.76s)]
*  Just two quick ones. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3828.84s)]
*  One, I know the presidents have answered a few questions here and there, [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3829.92s)]
*  but is there any plans for the president to come out [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3833.2799999999997s)]
*  and sort of address this investigation in a more fulsome way, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3835.24s)]
*  give more of a detailed timeline? [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3838.9599999999996s)]
*  I know you're referring us to the Counsel's Office, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3840.3999999999996s)]
*  but I'm wondering if we will hear more fully [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3843.2s)]
*  from the president himself on this matter. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3845.04s)]
*  Look, as you just stated in your question to me, [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3847.56s)]
*  the president has addressed this, spoken about this a couple of times. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3850.3199999999997s)]
*  And I don't have anything to announce right now, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3855.4399999999996s)]
*  but he's going to continue again to take questions from all of you, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3857.64s)]
*  as he has done these past several months, [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3860.8799999999997s)]
*  these two years, and he's going to take those questions, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3862.72s)]
*  as he understands, on behalf of the American people, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3865.9599999999996s)]
*  as you guys ask questions and do your reporting. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3868.08s)]
*  Just don't have anything to announce specifically on that question. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3871.72s)]
*  Okay, thanks, everybody. See you tomorrow. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UJWJo8Mp5O8&t=3875.08s)]
