# 'BUYING TIME': Military expert responds to Biden greenlighting a missile system to Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU)
*  Let's now bring in retired Admiral James Searing. He's the former director of the Missile Defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=0.0s)]
*  Agency. Sir, thank you for taking time with us today. Everybody in Washington is talking about [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=4.32s)]
*  the president's decision to deploy this major missile defense system to Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=10.0s)]
*  I want to start us off, though, with the blood and treasure that accompanies it. You just heard [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=16.4s)]
*  Trey report when 100 men and women in uniform are going along with the missile system to Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  That perhaps signals to Lebanon, to Hamas, to Hezbollah, to Iran, that the administration [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=30.16s)]
*  is putting American skin in the game in a way they have not so far, at least since the beginning of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=40.8s)]
*  this war. Hi, Jillian. Thanks for having me. I would look at it a little bit differently. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=45.44s)]
*  I would look at the missile defense systems that are in the theater and now THAAB being deployed [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=51.68s)]
*  to the region as de-escalatory in nature in terms of it is purely a defensive system. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=56.8s)]
*  It is clearly up to Iran to stop the aggression. And what the missile defense systems allow us [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  to do is buy time and make sure that there's not catastrophic damage from the two previous [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  large-scale attacks. So this is forward thinking on our part to deploy the THAAB battery with our [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=73.44s)]
*  soldiers in case Iran decides to escalate with even more ballistic missile attacks and longer [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=82.56s)]
*  range threats. So the international community is now waiting with bated breath to see how [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=88.24000000000001s)]
*  Israel is going to formally respond to the missile assault, missile barrage of a couple of weeks ago. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=95.76s)]
*  Do you think maybe part of the reason why we have not seen them take [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  kinetic action in that direction so far is because conversations about this THAAB system [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=109.6s)]
*  were in the works? No doubt. Offensive and defensive moves go together, Jillian, and deploying [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=117.84s)]
*  this system to the region will have an extra measure of protection if Iran decides to respond [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=124.8s)]
*  to the Israeli response and back and forth. Again, the missile defense systems that have been [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=131.44s)]
*  successful in the past in April and recently two weeks ago have bought us time to make much more [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=136.48s)]
*  calculated decisions, even keeled decisions in Navy terms for that action to be commensurate with [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=143.2s)]
*  what Israel and the terrorists have done in the region. It buys the policymakers time. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  As for President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, they have offered at every turn support [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=155.84s)]
*  to Israel in terms of money and weapons, but they have hedged a lot more in terms of publicly [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=163.2s)]
*  voicing support for the way the IDF has been conducting this war so far. Take a quick listen [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=168.95999999999998s)]
*  to some of what they've said, just some recently. The Israelis have every right to respond to [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=174.56s)]
*  vicious attacks on them, but the fact is that they have to be very much more careful about [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=183.04s)]
*  dealing with civilian casualties. We have got to reach a ceasefire both as it relates to what's [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=190.96s)]
*  happening in Lebanon and of course Gaza. We are working around the clock in that regard, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=196.88s)]
*  but we need these wars to end and we've got to definitely de-escalate what is happening in the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=201.36s)]
*  region. So given all that hedging, sir, were you surprised to learn that the president had [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=205.84s)]
*  green-lighted the THAAD system? I was not, Jillian. I was not in terms of what we saw in the last two [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  week attack two weeks ago in terms of not just the size of the attack, but the complexity in [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=221.44s)]
*  terms of the technology that was demonstrated by Iran. The system is needed in the region and it's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=228.08s)]
*  needed now and we've made the right decision to deploy it. All right, Admiral Searing, we got to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=234.16s)]
*  leave it there, but thank you for taking time with us today. Learned a lot from your expertise, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KZBloaPY9lU&t=239.36s)]
