# Professor's chilling warning on Iran, Hamas: 'Head of the snake is in Tehran'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU)
*  Breaking overnight, Israel directly blaming Iran for aiding Hamas before the war, offering [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=0.0s)]
*  training, money and weapons. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=5.88s)]
*  The IDF says Tehran also ordered recent attacks in Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=7.88s)]
*  And with Iran sending more threats to the West, the White House promises it will respond. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=13.16s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=18.04s)]
*  The United States does not seek conflict with Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=19.04s)]
*  We do not want this war to widen. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=22.84s)]
*  But if Iran or its proxies attack U.S. personnel anywhere, make no mistake, we will defend [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=25.64s)]
*  our people, we will defend our security swiftly and decisively. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=34.0s)]
*  American troops stationed on the U.S. bases in the Middle East have been attacked 14 times [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=39.72s)]
*  since the war started. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=44.28s)]
*  At least 24 hurt in those attacks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  Dr. Ramesh Sehbarad is the advisory board chair of the Organization of Iranian American [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=48.6s)]
*  Communities and she joins me now. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Dr. thanks so much for being here. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=55.6s)]
*  My problem with Blinken's statement is as follows. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=57.2s)]
*  U.S. personnel have been attacked, yet there has been little swift or decisive action from [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=60.400000000000006s)]
*  this White House. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=67.24000000000001s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=68.24000000000001s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  This is a regime that has been a strategic threat to peace and stability in the region. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=71.4s)]
*  At the end of the day, the head of the snake is in Tehran and we have to look at the root [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=77.2s)]
*  cause of this conflict. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=81.98s)]
*  This is a regime that's been waging a war on its own citizen for the past four decades [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=83.84s)]
*  with massacres across Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=88.56s)]
*  We saw it in the protests last year. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=90.67999999999999s)]
*  We saw it in the protests in 2019 in Zahedan massacre. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=93.32s)]
*  And again, the wars can go so far. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=97.72s)]
*  It really needs to be back with a firm policy on Iran. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=101.2s)]
*  And I think we need to deal with the Iranian problem with the way that the people of Iran [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=104.84s)]
*  are calling for the change of this regime from within. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  And the change will come by the Iranian people. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=113.44s)]
*  And that's how we need to really address the root cause of this problem. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=116.16s)]
*  Because only Iranian regime, only Tehran's Ayatollah, will benefit from ongoing conflict [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=119.6s)]
*  and the war in the region because of the fact that they're trying to shield themselves [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=126.28s)]
*  and uncover their inherent weakness on how they're facing an inevitable overthrow by [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=133.44s)]
*  the people of Iran. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=138.48s)]
*  Okay, but to that point, the strategy from the Biden administration thus far following [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  the Obama administration, obviously Trump was in the middle there, but it has been appeasement. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  In that last answer you gave, are you saying that we should actively support opposition [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=148.48s)]
*  forces in Iran to overthrow the current regime there? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=153.12s)]
*  You know, just 12 hours before this conflict broke in the Middle East, former Secretary [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=158.56s)]
*  of State Mark Pompeo was visiting with the leader of the Iranian opposition in Paris, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=166.12s)]
*  Mariam Rajavi. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=171.56s)]
*  And this is what he says. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=172.88s)]
*  He says, a serious missing factor in U.S. policy towards Iran has been a lack of political [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=173.88s)]
*  support for the Iranian people's right to overthrow this regime and the recognized and [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=180.2s)]
*  organized opposition group, which is the MEK. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=187.0s)]
*  So I think what we need to really do is to look at those facts and understand what does [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=190.56s)]
*  the future hold? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Do we want a future of war and conflict in the region or do we want a future of peace [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  and stability? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=201.08s)]
*  And again, Secretary Pompeo added that the future of U.S. policy towards Iran has to [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=202.08s)]
*  be centered around the support of this organized opposition and increasing pressure on the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=207.4s)]
*  regime until this regime falls. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=213.44s)]
*  There are specific steps that the U.S. administration can take to really address the root cause, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=215.04s)]
*  as I said, in dealing with the head of the snake in Iran. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=220.96s)]
*  And that includes stopping the appeasement, really choosing a very solid strategic policy [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=225.0s)]
*  on the Iranian regime so that the people of Iran are empowered to bring this regime down. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=231.16s)]
*  It does beg the question, Doctor, how far can Iran ultimately push its provocation of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=235.88s)]
*  the United States before we actually do act? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=241.12s)]
*  And does that action involve what you just discussed? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=244.60000000000002s)]
*  We will see. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=248.12s)]
*  It does seem like Mike Pompeo versus what we have now. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=249.12s)]
*  Mike Pompeo is a much better approach than the Biden administration. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=252.2s)]
*  Doctor Ramesh Separat, we appreciate your time and insight. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nrjngTCtEQU&t=258.59999999999997s)]
