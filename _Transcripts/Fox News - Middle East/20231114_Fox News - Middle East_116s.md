# Multi-rocket attack on U.S. forces in Syria
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY)
*  US defense officials are telling us that Fox News, telling us here at Fox News, that there [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=0.0s)]
*  was a multi-rocket attack on US forces inside Syria today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=5.28s)]
*  No injuries or damage that we know of to the base. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=11.48s)]
*  This is the fifth attack on US forces since Sunday's airstrike. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=15.4s)]
*  Remember, we fired back now three times. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=19.84s)]
*  The third time, they've hit us five times since then. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=23.0s)]
*  So we do one, they do five. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=26.18s)]
*  At this ratio, well, he's not doing enough, the president of the United States. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=27.64s)]
*  Can I just underline something? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=32.72s)]
*  So you add this in. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=33.72s)]
*  One second. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=34.72s)]
*  You add this in, and that is 53 attacks on our US military men and women stationed in [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=35.72s)]
*  the Middle East since October 17th. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=41.32s)]
*  All five so far of our responses have been inside Syria. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=44.08s)]
*  So just very quickly, Harris, this is what ties it all together. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=49.68s)]
*  The attitude to China, the attitude to Iran on every issue, even the attitude to crime [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=52.56s)]
*  here at home. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=59.0s)]
*  It's this ideology of appeasement that has infected the left. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=60.0s)]
*  And the ideology says that if you're nice to bad people, they'll be good. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=64.78s)]
*  And what we're seeing is the exact opposite. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=69.4s)]
*  If you're nice to bad people, they'll be even worse. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=71.76s)]
*  You know, I don't think he loves us. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=74.92s)]
*  I don't. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=76.80000000000001s)]
*  And I don't have to be bold to say that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=78.36s)]
*  33 Americans have been killed by Hamas terrorists. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=80.48s)]
*  At least nine are still being held hostage that we know of. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=85.4s)]
*  We don't know their whereabouts. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=88.76s)]
*  We don't know their conditions. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=90.2s)]
*  Our military men and women stationed around the Middle East have been hit 53 times. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=92.16s)]
*  And we've sent some planes with a couple of rockets and hit buildings that, well, really [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=96.72s)]
*  didn't have much in them. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=101.28s)]
*  Mr. President, see us. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=105.28s)]
*  You better see us. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=108.44s)]
*  It's election year. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=110.6s)]
*  Happy Tuesday. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=112.08s)]
*  Outnumbered in just a moment continues. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWxnboUXYYY&t=113.72s)]
