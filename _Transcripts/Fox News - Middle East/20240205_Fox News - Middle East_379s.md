# Houthis vow retaliation as NSA refuses to rule out strikes inside Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM)
*  The United States stepping up its response to Houthi threats across the Middle East carrying [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=0.0s)]
*  out more than 100 strikes against the Iran back group over the weekend and shooting down [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  yet another anti-ship missile in the Red Sea. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=16.06s)]
*  Trey Yanks live in Tel Aviv with more. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=19.22s)]
*  Hi Trey. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=21.36s)]
*  Hey Carly, good morning. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=22.36s)]
*  Last night the United States announced new strikes against Houthi targets in Yemen as [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=25.24s)]
*  the group prepared for more launches toward the Red Sea. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=30.36s)]
*  In this new video released by US Central Command, you can see the USS Gravely, the USS Carney, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=34.28s)]
*  and the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower supporting the strikes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=40.92s)]
*  The US response on Sunday followed a larger campaign on Saturday that hit 36 different [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  Iran-linked targets in Yemen. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=50.04s)]
*  Houthi rebels have released a statement threatening more attacks, with a spokesperson saying the [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=52.26s)]
*  aggression won't go unanswered and that escalation will be met with escalation. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=56.5s)]
*  US forces are on high alert across the region, bracing for a possible response to those strikes [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=60.98s)]
*  and the targeting of Iran-backed positions in Iraq and Syria on Friday. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=66.78s)]
*  On Fox News Sunday, National Security Council spokesman John Kirby said this about the situation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=71.1s)]
*  What you saw on Friday night was just the first round. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=77.74s)]
*  There will be additional response actions taken by the administration against the IRGC [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=80.32s)]
*  and these groups that they're backing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=84.96s)]
*  Over the weekend, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan would not rule out striking [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=89.24s)]
*  Iranian territory in response to the ongoing attacks against US forces. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=94.32s)]
*  Right now there is no diplomatic solution on the table to end rising tension across [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=99.1s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=103.94s)]
*  Carly? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=104.94s)]
*  Okay, Trey Yanks coming to us from a rainy Tel Aviv this morning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=105.94s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=108.44s)]
*  Let's bring in Lieutenant Colonel Scott Mann, who was a former Green Beret and leader of [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=110.16s)]
*  Task Force Pineapple. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=114.08s)]
*  Scott, good morning to you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=115.8s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  If the goal here is to force Iran to back down, do you think that our response has been [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  strong enough so far to achieve that? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=123.7s)]
*  Hey, good morning, Carly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=125.8s)]
*  Thanks for having me on. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=128.04s)]
*  No, I don't. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=129.04s)]
*  I think it's a good first step, surgical targeting like that with precision fires, but it's not [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=130.04s)]
*  enough. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=135.68s)]
*  I mean, this is an asymmetric threat, very, very hard to pin down. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=136.68s)]
*  A lot of times they probably moved a lot of the critical items and infrastructure or people. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=139.6s)]
*  So I think it is going to take a more determined, more focused response. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=144.28s)]
*  And absolutely, it could be even focused on Iran. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=148.04s)]
*  So you think that striking inside Iran would be a reasonable response? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=151.26s)]
*  And if so, what then would be the response to that be? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=157.4s)]
*  I think any response where we target the source and sponsors of asymmetric attacks [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=162.52s)]
*  against our forces positioned in the Middle East is an appropriate response. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=171.12s)]
*  And we should always signal that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=174.96s)]
*  We've always signaled that as a nation. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=176.44s)]
*  We've always been very clear that if you attack our forces in any kind of fashion, that it's [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=178.20000000000002s)]
*  going to be met with a response, 3X, 5X of that caliber. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=183.48000000000002s)]
*  So yeah, I think it's very appropriate. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=188.88s)]
*  In fact, right now, I think a lot of the veteran community is wondering where that is. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  And we're looking to see it more because those are our troops out there. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=195.56s)]
*  Those are our sons and daughters. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=198.1s)]
*  What do you think, Scott, of the Biden administration openly sending these warnings? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=199.1s)]
*  We will respond. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  We will react before pulling the trigger. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=204.5s)]
*  From a military standpoint, isn't the element of surprise something that is valued? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=207.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=211.44s)]
*  You know, and I never want to second guess the tactics of what's being done. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=212.44s)]
*  But from a policy perspective, that kind of signaling, you know, I don't think it's helpful. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=217.72s)]
*  I think what needs to be done is a proportional response to what's happened, you know, and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=222.68s)]
*  focusing on that rather than signaling what we will do. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=229.52s)]
*  I think there's been enough of that going on. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=232.56s)]
*  And again, I mean, we're seeing this across the board. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=234.8s)]
*  A lot of the veteran community is just losing a lot of our confidence in the political leadership [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  right now. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=242.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, the appointment of the ambassador to the Middle East, you know, who was overseeing [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=243.04s)]
*  the SIV process in Afghanistan. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=248.32s)]
*  I mean, it's just one thing after another. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=250.72s)]
*  I think the veteran community is losing a lot of confidence right now in our ability [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=252.39999999999998s)]
*  to take care of our own. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=256.94s)]
*  Yeah, you're referring to Tracy Jacobson. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=258.76s)]
*  The Biden administration nominated her as U.S. ambassador to Iraq last week. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=261.96s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=266.28s)]
*  What is notable about her is that she was in charge of the SIV program during our withdrawal [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=267.28s)]
*  from Afghanistan, special immigration visa program that was supposed to give paperwork [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=272.28s)]
*  to our Afghan allies, interpreters and military personnel to get them the paperwork so that [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=277.28s)]
*  they could be here and flee the Taliban. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=283.15999999999997s)]
*  But so many of those people, Scott, our allies, are still stuck in Afghanistan. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  Can you give us an update on that and also just maybe expand upon your thoughts on her [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=291.32s)]
*  getting this nomination? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=295.47999999999996s)]
*  Many see this as a promotion despite the SIV failure. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=297.17999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, there are tens of thousands of SIV eligible partners that fought alongside us still in [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=301.96s)]
*  Afghanistan who were being hunted and killed. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=307.88s)]
*  In fact, just last week, members of a group called Moral Compass that I'm a part of, veteran [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=309.76s)]
*  volunteers testified on Capitol Hill on the horrible atrocities that are happening against [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=313.88s)]
*  our allies. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=319.64s)]
*  You have gender apartheid going on on a Herculean scale, yet the State Department promotes to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=320.64s)]
*  an ambassadorship the very person who was overseeing the special immigration visa process. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=326.6s)]
*  It's a slap in the face to veterans, frankly, who see our politicians as just becoming completely [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=332.40000000000003s)]
*  tone deaf. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=337.64000000000004s)]
*  Meanwhile, veterans, 900 days later, are still paying for safe houses. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=338.64000000000004s)]
*  They're still overseeing medical care. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=343.04s)]
*  They're still advocating for their allies. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=345.16s)]
*  While the State Department sends, you know, $80 million every 10 days to directly to the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=348.48s)]
*  Taliban and will not negotiate in any capacity with the political wing of the resistance. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=354.6s)]
*  It just makes no sense. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=360.28000000000003s)]
*  And it's not hard to see where retention and recruiting are a problem in the United States [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=361.28000000000003s)]
*  military right now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=364.8s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=365.8s)]
*  And you know, her nomination is going to need Senate approval. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=366.8s)]
*  So maybe some of those senators will listen to what you're saying right now and take that [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=369.32000000000005s)]
*  into consideration before casting their vote. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=373.72s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Mann, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gI1rcf6VOM&t=378.16s)]
