# Mike Pompeo: Israel’s taken a ‘righteous strike’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI)
*  All right, Trey, thank you, military officials. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel now striking at multiple targets, dozens of sites all across Iran. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=2.7s)]
*  Israeli officials have said they have had enough in terms of the fusion material that [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=10.1s)]
*  Iran may have as much to make 15 nuclear bombs within days. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=15.94s)]
*  This coincides with multiple reports that they had gotten a 60 percent enrichment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=20.38s)]
*  All reports, every expert we have spoken to has told us that the number of weeks needed [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=24.96s)]
*  to get to nuclear-grade, weapons-grade material is less than a month. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=29.96s)]
*  Anyway, here to weigh in on all this, former Secretary of State, Fox News contributor Mike [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=35.44s)]
*  Pompeo, Mike, this is a fight for Israel's survival. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=39.2s)]
*  This is it for them. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=43.44s)]
*  They have done everything possible to destroy this state. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=46.08s)]
*  They have funded terror. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  They helped plan and orchestrate the October 7th attacks. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=50.08s)]
*  That was the equivalent of 40,000 dead Americans a day if you extrapolate out population size. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=54.04s)]
*  That's murder, that's rape, that's kidnapping, that's torture, that's beheading. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=59.96s)]
*  Then they're getting hit in the other direction, again, funded by Iran and all of the terror [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=63.68s)]
*  support by Iran. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=68.68s)]
*  Number one state sponsor of terror, that's Hezbollah in the north out of Lebanon. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=70.32s)]
*  They've also been funding the Houthi rebels and providing the weaponry for them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=74.4s)]
*  And twice now they have fired directly into Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=79.28s)]
*  Now that they get close to a nuclear weapon, I don't see that Israel had any choice here [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=82.63999999999999s)]
*  tonight but to go at those nuclear facilities. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=89.32s)]
*  Yes, Sean, I agree. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=90.32s)]
*  They had little option. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=93.96s)]
*  The time was running out. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  A nuclear conflict in the region would have been devastating not only for the Israelis [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=96.63999999999999s)]
*  but for American interests, for the Gulf Arab states as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=100.28s)]
*  The last few days there has been this reporting that they might do this. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=103.72s)]
*  I'm sure the Iranians were preparing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=106.19999999999999s)]
*  And so I think the Israelis said it's go time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=108.08s)]
*  We must do this to protect the sovereign nation of Israel. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=110.82s)]
*  It's a righteous strike that they have taken. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=114.69999999999999s)]
*  It's going to take them days to actually accomplish the mission of deterring this program [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=117.38s)]
*  and setting this program back by years. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=121.1s)]
*  I'm confident that they can do that. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=123.02s)]
*  And all nations who have been attacked by Iran, including the Americans—we've had [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=125.25999999999999s)]
*  hundreds of Americans killed by the Iranians over the last years—has an obligation to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=130.62s)]
*  get this right and provide whatever assistance Israel needs so that it can conduct the attacks [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=134.5s)]
*  to complete this mission and put their nuclear weapons program back decades, if not forever. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, Conventional Wisdom has always said that they needed our bunker buster bombs [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  to accomplish this mission. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=152.0s)]
*  Otherwise, their only option to accomplish it would have been a tactical nuke. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=153.68s)]
*  Do you know if the United States at any point provided any of these bunker busters to Israel? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=158.44s)]
*  Is it because these facilities, nuclear facilities in Iran, are buried so deep inside the ground? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=164.36s)]
*  Shauna, I don't know the answer to that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=169.36s)]
*  I do know that President Trump has been preparing for this. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=173.16s)]
*  We've seen all the weapon systems that he has moved into the region, not only defensive [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=175.6s)]
*  weapon systems in terms of what you were talking about earlier, to protect from missiles, but [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=179.96s)]
*  we've moved B-52s closer. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  The United States has been preparing to help not only the Israelis, but our Gulf Arab State [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=187.12s)]
*  allies as well. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=190.92000000000002s)]
*  The Israelis have the capability over a time to actually accomplish the depth that they [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=193.08s)]
*  need. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=197.52s)]
*  I think they can pull it off. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=198.52s)]
*  It will require a lot of work and a lot of sustained effort, and it will require some, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=199.52s)]
*  at least, indirect assistance from the United States of America as well. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=203.84s)]
*  Let me ask you, there was a report on Axios today about the possibility, and there's [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=208.4s)]
*  been chatter all day that this was a possibility today or tomorrow or in the days to come, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=212.96s)]
*  But one of the problems has been, according to estimates and sources I've had, and they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=219.28s)]
*  reported it in Axios, that Iran has 2,000 or 3,000 missiles with warheads that can carry [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=224.04s)]
*  2,000 pounds of explosives. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  On Wednesday, their minister of defense in Iran claiming they have a new ballistic missile [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=234.44s)]
*  with a 4,000-pound warhead, and they were building at least 50 to 100 more a month. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=239.36s)]
*  Now, I interpret that to be Plan B. In other words, it should not be a surprise to the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=246.35999999999999s)]
*  Iranians that the Israelis are going after their nuclear sites, but it sounds like they've [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=251.88s)]
*  been building up these long-range ballistic missiles to overwhelm the Iron Dome and destroy [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=256.96s)]
*  Israel that way. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=262.28s)]
*  In other words, I'd call that Plan B on their part. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=263.71999999999997s)]
*  How would you interpret it? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=266.2s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=267.76s)]
*  That's exactly what it is, Sean. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=270.08s)]
*  I think that was further reason the Israelis thought this was the moment we've got to [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=271.52s)]
*  do this, do this for themselves. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=275.32s)]
*  If they accomplish their mission, it'll be an enormous good for humankind as well. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=277.96s)]
*  We shouldn't forget that the Iranians lost the largest ballistic missile attack in an [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  awfully long time against Israel back last year. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=288.12s)]
*  They've killed hundreds of Americans. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  There's lots of work to be done in the days ahead, and I'm confident the Israelis are [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=293.76s)]
*  prepared to defend their own nation. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=298.28s)]
*  We shouldn't forget this, too, Sean. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  Those capabilities are real. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=303.12s)]
*  What you just described in terms of the Iranian missile system is very real and very threatening. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=304.32s)]
*  But when determined, the United States has demonstrated that the Iranians won't respond [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=309.48s)]
*  with an overwhelming response. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=314.92s)]
*  They said when we move the embassy to Jerusalem, there'd be a World War III. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=316.96000000000004s)]
*  They said if we took a strike on Qasem Soleimani, there'll be World War III. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=320.82s)]
*  In neither case was there. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=324.62s)]
*  The Iranians gave very weak, very ineffectual responses. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=325.76s)]
*  And we shouldn't forget the Iranians are still trying to kill American officials. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=328.92s)]
*  We have a real interest in Israel being successful in the coming days. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=333.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=336.88s)]
*  Well, we're watching very closely. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=337.88s)]
*  Israeli officials say that they've had enough time, and there's been a lot of patience. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=340.92s)]
*  You've got to give President Trump a lot of credit. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=345.6s)]
*  You've got to give Steve Wittkopf a lot of credit. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=348.0s)]
*  You've got to give Secretary of State Marco Rubio a lot of credit, because all three of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=349.98s)]
*  them have been very, very clear in their messaging they don't want this—they did not want [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=354.68s)]
*  this day to occur. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=360.36s)]
*  Every report that I have read, it was President Trump, it was Steve Wittkopf, it was Marco [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=362.12s)]
*  Rubio urging patience, hoping that they would choose peace over what now is the ultimate [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=368.4s)]
*  decision that, frankly, the world was going to have to come to grips with at some point [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=374.52s)]
*  anyway. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=378.44s)]
*  So, I give the president a lot of credit for trying the peace option. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=379.44s)]
*  This really is on the Iranians. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=382.92s)]
*  They have made this choice. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=384.6s)]
*  You have to believe that the number one state sponsor of terror that says they want to wipe [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=386.15999999999997s)]
*  Israel and the U.S. off the map when they say it, I think you've got to believe it, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=389.71999999999997s)]
*  and I think that's why we find ourselves in this position tonight. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=393.28s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, great to see you. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  The world's been very patient. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=399.15999999999997s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  President Trump was very patient. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=401.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=402.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=403.15999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they really were. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BGYozHjGgEI&t=404.15999999999997s)]
