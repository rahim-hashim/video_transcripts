# White House: This is the closest we've been to Hamas hostage deal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0)
*  Alright, we begin with the 7 a.m. hour of Fox & Friends with the War on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF now says it's taken out three Hamas commanders in overnight strikes. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Excellent. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=11.82s)]
*  This as Israeli forces uncover footage showing blooding victims of Hamas' attack being hauled [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=12.82s)]
*  into the Al-Sharif hospital, hours after troops allegedly discovered a Hamas tunnel under [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=18.2s)]
*  the complex. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=23.72s)]
*  Mark Regev is the senior advisor to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and joins [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=24.72s)]
*  us right now from Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=29.48s)]
*  Mark, good afternoon to you. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=31.2s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=33.92s)]
*  Let's start right there with the closed circuit footage showing blooded victims being or [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=36.2s)]
*  blooded people being taken into the hospital. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=44.96s)]
*  I know the IDF is saying those are hostages and they're obviously after they were treated, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=49.28s)]
*  they were probably carted off someplace. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=55.32s)]
*  How do you know they were hostages? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=58.7s)]
*  So first of all, it's clear. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=62.18s)]
*  They've been identified that they were people taken in the horrendous and horrific attack [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=63.580000000000005s)]
*  of October 7th. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=70.18s)]
*  As you know, some 1200 people were murdered on that day and they took back some 240 hostages [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=72.06s)]
*  into Gaza, including children, 32 children, including babies and toddlers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=80.86s)]
*  Now because we're slowly going through all the cameras that at the hospital we found [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=86.7s)]
*  these pictures, I'm sure we'll found more, but we found documented evidence that those [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=91.44s)]
*  hostages were taken to the hospital by Hamas, not for medical treatment, but because that's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=95.58s)]
*  where they were imprisoned, that's where they were hauled. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  There's also evidence of a young Israeli female soldier who was murdered there by Hamas after [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=103.18s)]
*  being taken hostage. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=109.18s)]
*  And now this puts, I think, exposes clearly Hamas' lies. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=110.66s)]
*  They've been saying for weeks that they've got no military installation there under the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=115.5s)]
*  hospital and more concerning is you've got international organizations who have been [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=119.46s)]
*  parroting this Hamas fiction that there's no Hamas military presence under the hospital. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=124.62s)]
*  And you know, we've not seen it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=132.54s)]
*  We've seen no proof. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=133.82s)]
*  I think it's time the whole world now admitted Hamas has been brutalizing the people of Gaza, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=134.82s)]
*  Hamas has deliberately used this hospital as a shield for its military machine and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=140.58s)]
*  all those in the international community, those in the UN and other organizations who've [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=145.06s)]
*  been saying for weeks there's no evidence. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=150.22000000000003s)]
*  These are only Israeli claims. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=152.42000000000002s)]
*  Yes, it's now time that they admitted. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=153.98000000000002s)]
*  So Hamas has committed a war crime. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=156.38000000000002s)]
*  How do you counter that? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=158.46s)]
*  Because right now, and it is true, and you guys have laid out the evidence there, but [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=160.06s)]
*  from the international community standpoint, and I think it's important to note that they've [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=164.82000000000002s)]
*  never stood with Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=168.66s)]
*  The UN has never stood with Israel in modern day time. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=170.06s)]
*  How do you counter that message? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=174.22s)]
*  Because right now it appears that you guys are losing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=176.22s)]
*  So we're showing the proof. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=180.98s)]
*  That's how we're countering the lies. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=182.98s)]
*  We've got pictures of the hostages inside the hospital not receiving medical treatment [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=185.3s)]
*  once again, but being just held there. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=190.3s)]
*  We are sure that there are others and we'll find pictures of that too, I believe. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=194.38s)]
*  We've got pictures of the tunnels. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=198.24s)]
*  We've got a picture of this shaft going down underground, deep underground, leading to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  the network of tunnels that Hamas has there. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=205.96s)]
*  Yeah, which is a spiral staircase. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=208.36s)]
*  Mark, you showed us video, where we have video of the spiral, the metal spiral staircase [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=210.12s)]
*  going down and then you see the concrete walls and then you get to a steel wall. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=214.84s)]
*  You guys believe it's booby trapped. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=220.44s)]
*  Do you have a plan to open up that door? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=222.36s)]
*  We have a plan to go into all the tunnels. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=225.82000000000002s)]
*  We've got to take our time. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=228.32s)]
*  We don't want to endanger our service people more than we have to. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=229.38s)]
*  And so we'll be doing those pictures, as you know, were taken by a drone because we didn't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=233.9s)]
*  want to send our own people down. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=238.04s)]
*  We are scared, concerned about booby traps and so forth. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=239.22s)]
*  So we want the truth out there and we'll do our best to do that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=242.32s)]
*  At the same time, we want to safeguard our young fighting men and women, make sure that [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=245.12s)]
*  they're not unnecessarily put in harm's way. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=249.16s)]
*  But we'll get there. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=251.2s)]
*  It might take a day, it might take two days, but we'll get there and we'll hopefully have [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=252.2s)]
*  a situation where we can have actually international media, including Fox, down there in the tunnels, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=256.0s)]
*  taking your own pictures. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=260.76s)]
*  Mark, the deputy U.S. national security adviser, John Finer, is suggesting that there is a [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=262.0s)]
*  deal that we are close to getting those hostages back home. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=267.28s)]
*  Listen to what he said yesterday. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=271.04s)]
*  Mr. President, when will more hostages get out? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=272.04s)]
*  When will more hostages get out? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=277.04s)]
*  I believe we are closer than we have been in quite some time, maybe closer than we have [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=286.04s)]
*  been since the beginning of this process to getting this deal done. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=290.04s)]
*  All right, so tell us more about this deal. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=293.6s)]
*  So if we are closer, and I hope we are, but I'm not sure we are, but if we are closer, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=298.24s)]
*  it's because of the military pressure on Hamas. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=304.92s)]
*  We've been hitting their military machine hard. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=307.72s)]
*  We've been taking out, as you've just reported, their senior commanders, and we are continuing [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=310.16s)]
*  to do so. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=314.6s)]
*  Now, Israel has said, for the release of our hostages, we are willing for a ceasefire. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=316.20000000000005s)]
*  And Hamas, as we hit them hard, needs that time out. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  It will only be a temporary ceasefire, but they need that time out. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=324.48s)]
*  And as a result, we believe the probability that they're agreeing, will agree to a release [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=328.24s)]
*  of our people has gone up. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=332.24s)]
*  Once again, it's not done until it's done. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=335.44s)]
*  I can't tell you what's going to happen, but I think the probability of it happening has [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=337.48s)]
*  gone up. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=341.48s)]
*  So, fundamentally, it depends on Hamas, and they are a brutal terrorist organization, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=342.48s)]
*  and it's difficult sometimes to understand how they calculate the situation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=346.88s)]
*  Do they have to release all the hostages, or I was reading one article, the women and [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=351.12s)]
*  the children? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=355.08000000000004s)]
*  Look, if they want us to give a ceasefire, a temporary ceasefire, they have to do something [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  significant. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  We've had hostages releases before. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=365.88s)]
*  We had the two American women, and then we had the two elderly Israeli women, and then [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=367.6s)]
*  there was the young soldier that our special forces actually rescued. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=371.44s)]
*  But that's five people out of 240. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=375.84000000000003s)]
*  It's a drop in the bucket. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=378.72s)]
*  There has to be a significant release of hostages. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=380.44s)]
*  That's what we're after. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  We want them all released. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=384.28000000000003s)]
*  We want a significant release up front. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=385.76s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=387.56s)]
*  Okay, so you get those 200-and-some hostages taken on October the 7th. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=388.56s)]
*  But now you've got, in the Red Sea, there was an Israeli-linked cargo ship, and then [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=393.76s)]
*  you've got these Houthi rebels who are part of, you know, essentially Iranian proxies. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=398.88s)]
*  They grabbed 25 more hostages. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=405.44s)]
*  Where are they going to go? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=409.84000000000003s)]
*  They're in Yemen somewhere, I presume. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=413.6s)]
*  But let's be clear here. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=416.40000000000003s)]
*  This is just another manifestation of what we call Iran's axis of terror, because the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=418.96000000000004s)]
*  center is in Iran, and then there are tentacles to this octopus. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=425.16s)]
*  Hamas is one in Gaza, Hezbollah is another in Lebanon, and of course the Houthis in Yemen. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=429.64000000000004s)]
*  And if these people break international law, yes, and they act as pirates on the high seas, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=436.44s)]
*  yes, and take over a legally-bound voyage, that is just a sign of who we're up against. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=444.44000000000005s)]
*  These people have no qualms about attacking peaceful shipping on the high seas. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=450.44s)]
*  They've got no qualms about using hospitals as military installations. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=455.48s)]
*  They have no qualms about shooting their rockets into civilian areas, trying to kill as many [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=459.08s)]
*  innocent civilians as they can. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=464.36s)]
*  This is our enemy. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=466.12s)]
*  So, Mark, do you need more from the U.S.? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=467.12s)]
*  And I get it. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=469.72s)]
*  It's hard to criticize the United States because you guys need more support from us. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=470.72s)]
*  You don't want to cloud the relationship. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=475.3s)]
*  You guys are being attacked from all fronts here, and Iran is an enemy to America as well. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=478.40000000000003s)]
*  So do you need our guys' support as well on the ground? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=483.12s)]
*  I want to tell you that the administration, President Biden, the Congress, both houses, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=487.76s)]
*  both parties, and the American people have shown amazing support for Israel during this crisis. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=492.88s)]
*  You are our best friend. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=499.36s)]
*  We have no better friend on this planet, and we appreciate and we want to say thank you [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  for that support. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=507.84s)]
*  America has been there for us, whether it's in the moral support, in the strong words [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=508.56s)]
*  coming out of the administration and the Congress, whether it's the tangible support in helping [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=515.04s)]
*  us, giving us the arms we need. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=520.0799999999999s)]
*  Ultimately, we're not asking for anyone's boots on the ground in Gaza except our own. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=522.3199999999999s)]
*  But to quote Churchill, you are giving us the tools to finish the job, and that is greatly, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=527.04s)]
*  greatly appreciated. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=532.24s)]
*  And the Houthi rebels are a huge problem. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  They keep sending rockets over. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=535.12s)]
*  The Saudis know it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=536.8s)]
*  The Saudis were ignored. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=538.24s)]
*  This administration has taken the Houthi rebels off the terrorist. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=539.76s)]
*  That's a huge mistake. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=543.3599999999999s)]
*  And now they're starting to hijack ships that are coming through because some billionaire [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=544.7199999999999s)]
*  Israeli might own this one ship, but the Japanese run it. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=551.4399999999999s)]
*  So the Houthi rebels have to be addressed by somebody. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=555.12s)]
*  That could be us. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=558.4799999999999s)]
*  That should be us. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=559.8399999999999s)]
*  Mark, thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=560.8s)]
*  Good luck. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Mark. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=563.04s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=563.76s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=564.88s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BSdeVnxt4L0&t=565.52s)]
