# Baier on Iran missile attack: This is Trump's biggest test
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk)
*  Brett Baer, who essentially runs politics here at Fox, always happy to have him on our [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=0.0s)]
*  show, joins us on set tonight. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=4.2s)]
*  Where are we in this? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=6.2s)]
*  Yeah, I'm talking to sources inside Iraq, inside the U.S. government. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=7.2s)]
*  Here's what we know. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=12.92s)]
*  We know that two bases have been struck by the Iranians with missiles from Iran, which [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=13.92s)]
*  in and of itself is a huge escalation. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=18.28s)]
*  Many people thought that the attacks would be coming from proxies inside Iraq. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  These are fired from Iran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=24.76s)]
*  But the choice of those two bases is interesting. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=26.72s)]
*  One was Al-Assad, which is in the Sunni stronghold of Al-Ambar province. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=29.18s)]
*  The other one is Erbil, which is the Kurdish capital. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=34.46s)]
*  They don't have as many U.S. forces as Balad, which is a major base that's actually closer [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=38.62s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=44.5s)]
*  Is this a signal? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  Is this a message? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  Is it because the Sunnis and the Kurds were supporting the U.S. and against the Shia in [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=48.620000000000005s)]
*  the Iraqi parliament who... [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=53.54s)]
*  Wait, so what you're saying is if you're Iran and you wanted to inflict maximum damage on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=55.18s)]
*  American troops in Iraq, you would have hit a different base? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=59.5s)]
*  And it would have been easier. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=62.94s)]
*  Balad is a major base and it's closer to Iran. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=63.94s)]
*  I'm reading through the tea leaves here. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=67.2s)]
*  I'm saying that we'll see what the damage assessment is, but if as reported that no [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=68.78s)]
*  U.S. casualties, we don't know if the Iraqis took casualties at either one of these bases. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=74.78s)]
*  I think what you're seeing here from your source on the ground in Baghdad could be more [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=81.5s)]
*  about the Iranian Shia militias that support Iran that may be active inside Baghdad, which [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=87.33999999999999s)]
*  we saw during the Iraq war at the beginning. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  For sure. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=96.17999999999999s)]
*  It was a defining factor. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=97.17999999999999s)]
*  So how is this...and again, this is moving even as we speak, but to the extent we can [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=98.17999999999999s)]
*  tell now, how is this affecting the presidential race currently in progress? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=103.17999999999999s)]
*  How is that breaking down? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=108.06s)]
*  I think we have yet to see. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  I think that this is the biggest test for President Trump as a leader. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  It is by far his biggest test. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=115.06s)]
*  As you know, he campaigned on getting out of the Middle East, bringing troops home. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=117.18s)]
*  This is his moment to decide how far to push this, what the response is, and what that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=123.74000000000001s)]
*  response will be will dictate how the rest of the world reacts. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  As far as the politics, it changed the democratic race significantly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=132.74s)]
*  You've seen Bernie Sanders go far hard on this Iran issue. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=137.82s)]
*  Joe Biden is trying to ride the rails, but he has his own issues about what the Obama [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=142.06s)]
*  administration did with Iran and the red line and the paying of money to Iranian officials. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  So it's not...I guess what I'm asking is... [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=152.7s)]
*  It's not cut and dry. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=154.9s)]
*  It's not. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=155.9s)]
*  It's not. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=156.9s)]
*  It's hard as someone watching this who's not covering politics full-time anymore, as you [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=157.9s)]
*  are, to see how...it doesn't seem like the Democrats are all the way on one side and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=161.26s)]
*  the Republicans all the way on the other. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=167.14000000000001s)]
*  It's more confusing than that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=169.14000000000001s)]
*  And the fact that we are now in an election year, that we are three and a half weeks away [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  from the Iowa caucuses, this is a major event that will have big repercussions. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=174.58s)]
*  But most importantly, the next steps on the ground in Iraq, in Iran, and whether those [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=180.54000000000002s)]
*  targets inside Iran, maybe that shot, those missiles, will be in the sights of U.S. war [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=186.66s)]
*  plans. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=192.62s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=193.62s)]
*  Is it clear the White House...I hate to use the phrase talking points, but position, like [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=194.78s)]
*  if you were to sit down with the president or one of his advisors and say, you know, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=198.82s)]
*  what's our plan going forward? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=202.9s)]
*  Is it clear what the answer would be? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=205.1s)]
*  Or is that the purpose, do you think, of the president addressing the nation tonight? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=206.54s)]
*  That's the purpose. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  If and when he does it, that it'll be a clear, here's where we are, this is what I'm thinking. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  Notice we didn't hear anything from the Gang of Eight or anybody up on Capitol Hill after [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=216.1s)]
*  they were briefed by officials. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=219.94s)]
*  The whole House and Senate expected to be briefed tomorrow on the intelligence that [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=221.58s)]
*  led to the taking out of Soleimani based on what they said was an imminent attack that [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=225.62s)]
*  was coming. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=230.1s)]
*  I think there's heavy skepticism up on Capitol Hill and in different corners, and maybe that's [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=231.1s)]
*  what the president's going to address. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=236.02s)]
*  He's going to address why we did it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=237.82s)]
*  Yeah, and maybe next steps. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=239.66s)]
*  I mean, this is the moment where the country is going to want to know where are we going [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=241.02s)]
*  from here. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=245.86s)]
*  The damage assessment by now, they have a decent sense of what it looks like on the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=247.26s)]
*  ground. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=252.22s)]
*  So I know you're not in the editorializing business, but tell me if you can confirm this [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=253.22s)]
*  instinct. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=256.21999999999997s)]
*  My sense is of the president that he's not interested in some kind of protracted war [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=257.21999999999997s)]
*  with Iran, certainly not a ground war, that he's not, you know, his instincts are restrained. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=261.46s)]
*  Is that what you're sensing or hearing? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=268.62s)]
*  Policy-wise, what he campaigned on, that's what he suggests. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=271.53999999999996s)]
*  What he says verbally about being tough against Iran, what he tweets out, sends a different [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=274.90000000000003s)]
*  message. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=282.90000000000003s)]
*  So whether his rhetoric matches up with what the policy decision is going to be tonight, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  I think is the key moment for this president as commander in chief. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=288.58000000000004s)]
*  And last question, do you think we are going to hear from the president tonight? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=292.74s)]
*  I would guess that we would, because it's that big of a moment. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=296.18s)]
*  And listen, having covered the Pentagon for a long time, there's a lot of stuff happening [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=301.66s)]
*  behind the scenes. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=305.42s)]
*  There's all kinds of targets that have already been chosen. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=306.42s)]
*  The question is whether we are going to step to that next level and what our response will [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=311.18s)]
*  be. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=315.22s)]
*  And this being Washington, and Washington being fundamentally bureaucratic, a lot of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=316.22s)]
*  Pentagon employees, including Uniform, were sent home today. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=319.06s)]
*  Which is surreal. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=321.66s)]
*  Early because of a snowstorm that never really materialized, because once again, this is [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=322.66s)]
*  the federal government. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=326.58s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=327.58s)]
*  At one o'clock, it was a ghost town. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=328.58s)]
*  There was nobody there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=330.22s)]
*  As this all was happening, the public relations office apparently was closed down. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=331.22s)]
*  It was like tumbleweeds going through the Pentagon. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=335.14000000000004s)]
*  It's not shocking to those of us who live here, but to the rest of the country, they [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=337.54s)]
*  must be watching with jaws open. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=340.46000000000004s)]
*  Brett Barrett, great to see you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=342.3s)]
*  Thank you so much for that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=343.3s)]
*  Sure, Tucker. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0_pfz2Yszk&t=344.3s)]
