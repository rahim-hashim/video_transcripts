# Leaving Hamas out of the conversation is a 'major mistake,' Democratic rep says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4)
*  With us now, Adam Smith, the House Armed Services Committee ranking member and congressman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=0.0s)]
*  You might have heard part of our discussion there, but I did talk to Senator Chris Coons yesterday [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=4.72s)]
*  on this issue as to whether support for Israel is waning, particularly among [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=9.44s)]
*  Democratic leaders. I want you to respond to this. This was from Chris Coons yesterday. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=15.36s)]
*  Look, I would not abandon Israel. I would not abandon the defense of Israel against their [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=21.92s)]
*  enemies in the region, particularly in the face of an imminent strike by Iran against Israel, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=28.08s)]
*  if that were to become a reality. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=34.64s)]
*  No, no, with all respect, sir, that's not what I asked. If they go into Ratha and do this, would [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=35.6s)]
*  you, would you say, all right, that's a game changer, Israel? We told you not to do it, and you did. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=39.599999999999994s)]
*  I would be willing to put conditions on the delivery of military munitions for that ongoing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=46.0s)]
*  campaign. I would not sever ties between the United States and Israel. I wouldn't abandon Israel. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=52.0s)]
*  I would begin to condition the munitions that we provide for an ongoing campaign in Ratha. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=58.4s)]
*  Congressman, let me ask you about that. Do you share that view that if Israel doesn't sort of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=65.92s)]
*  dial things back, everything's on the table, including aid? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=72.0s)]
*  Well, I don't share the view that we're going to cut Israel off. When you get into the issue of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  putting conditions on the military support, that gets really complicated. But I think all of that [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=81.6s)]
*  misses the central point here. The central point here is we want Israel to change the way they are [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=87.44s)]
*  conducting this war. Now, Israel has had a very aggressive approach from October 7th forward, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=93.12s)]
*  and it's understandable why they reacted that way. It is not working to their advantage, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=99.52s)]
*  and it is causing a devastating humanitarian crisis in Gaza right now. So our position is they [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=105.52s)]
*  need to change that. And I think the president's call for a ceasefire is a call for a temporary [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=111.68s)]
*  ceasefire, mainly focused around that humanitarian concern. Humanitarian aid is not getting in. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=116.88s)]
*  Aid workers are vulnerable and, as a consequence, pulling back, as we've seen most drastically in [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=123.28s)]
*  the world's central kitchen strike. In order to get humanitarian assistance in, you need that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=129.92s)]
*  brief ceasefire and a change in policy. And look, from the very start, Israel was like, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=135.92s)]
*  we're going in. And they cite all kinds of examples of different wars against different groups where [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=140.72s)]
*  many civilians were killed. And I understand that argument. But given what Israel is trying [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=146.16s)]
*  to accomplish in Gaza, that approach is not the right approach. And that's what President Biden [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  is communicating to Israel right now. But didn't he go further than that, Congressman? I mean, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  there does seem to be a trend among some of your party colleagues. I mentioned Chris Coons, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=161.12s)]
*  but I could also mention Senator Tim Kaine, who says our current position toward Israel is just [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=166.32s)]
*  not working. Bernie Sanders, a long critic here, the way Benjamin Netanyahu is conducting this war, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=171.44s)]
*  not another penny. We go back to Chuck Schumer saying that elections should be held now, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=177.68s)]
*  an unprecedented move for a U.S. senator recommending such for a sovereign nation, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=183.44s)]
*  no matter whether it's run by a conservative or a liberal or anyone in between. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=187.92s)]
*  Does any of that trouble you, or the fact that Hamas celebrates this apparently in-your-face [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=192.24s)]
*  phone call that the president had with Benjamin Netanyahu? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=198.4s)]
*  Yeah, what really troubles me is that Hamas is not being held accountable in this discussion. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  And there's a wide range of opinions here. And I don't want to link myself to other people's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=207.76s)]
*  opinions. I want to say sort of where I'm coming from. And number one, I don't agree with not one [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=213.20000000000002s)]
*  more penny. Israel faces profound threats in the region from Hezbollah and Iran and others. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=217.28s)]
*  If we don't help them, their ability to deter those threats and stop the war from spreading [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=223.83999999999997s)]
*  will be significantly hindered. But as I said, Israel's approach to the war right now in terms [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=229.51999999999998s)]
*  of the humanitarian crisis just isn't working. It's not working for them, and it's not working [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  to get to a more peaceful resolution long term. But the other part of it is leaving Hamas completely [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=242.32s)]
*  out of this conversation, as the UN did, that doesn't help the cause of peace either. Hamas [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=249.6s)]
*  doesn't feel any pressure right now. The UN hasn't even been able to bring themselves to condemn Hamas, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  not just for the October 7th attack, but for the way Hamas is conducting this war, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=261.76s)]
*  hiding behind civilians. But you know, Hamas is winning this PR war, to your point, sir. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=266.88s)]
*  And Hamas is the one that celebrated this phone call. And Hamas is the one saying, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=271.68s)]
*  look, we've got the US potentially turning on Benjamin Netanyahu. Our perception is everything [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=276.8s)]
*  in the world, as you know. And the perception, I read a lot of the foreign press just this morning, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=281.04s)]
*  even in the Financial Times today, talking about the administration taking an unprecedented move [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=285.12s)]
*  to step back from Israel. Are we stepping back, dialing back Israel? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=290.88000000000005s)]
*  We have not, and we are not. I mean, look, there's two separate things. Let me agree with you on one [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=298.32000000000005s)]
*  point. I think as Democrats, or as anybody talks about this, the UN globally, to completely leave [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=304.16s)]
*  Hamas out of the conversation is a major mistake. Because what incentive does Hamas have? Lost in [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=310.08000000000004s)]
*  all of this is the fact that Israel, with the US support and pressure, has put offers on the table [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  for a ceasefire repeatedly over the course of the last, gosh, six weeks now. And Hamas has turned [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=322.24s)]
*  down those offers for a ceasefire. So to not put pressure on Hamas is to make it harder to get it [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=328.32s)]
*  into this war. So I agree with that. But we haven't done that. We're not doing that. We're [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  doing just the opposite. The Hamas delegation is heading to Cairo right now on these ceasefire talks. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=340.0s)]
*  Now, obviously, the president, to his credit, is trying to urge the leaders of Egypt and Qatar [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=345.76s)]
*  to do their part in trying to influence Hamas to do something. But Hamas seems to be holding all [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=350.48s)]
*  the cards, and they started this whole thing. You know, I agree. We need to put more pressure on them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=355.68s)]
*  But the part that you have to agree with the president on- But again, we're not, right? We're [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=361.12s)]
*  not. And your point is taken in Congress, but we're not doing it. No, I heard you. I heard you. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=364.32s)]
*  I heard you, and I agreed with you. But there's another part to this that we also need to get to, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=369.6s)]
*  and that is the way Israel is conducting the war in Gaza, the way from the very start. I mean, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=374.48s)]
*  remember, there were too many Israeli officials from the very start saying, you know, no food, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=379.12s)]
*  no water, no fuel, no medical supplies. And they took a very extreme position towards this. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=384.48s)]
*  And we also need, as the major supporter of Israel and the world, to say, you need to change that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  You cannot have a policy that completely ignores humanitarian assistance in Israel. Now, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=398.0s)]
*  they've changed that. They began to try to move, but they have not moved quickly enough. They have [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=402.96000000000004s)]
*  not allowed enough humanitarian assistance in. And clearly, within Gaza, they have not offered [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=408.0s)]
*  protection to the humanitarian workers who are trying to keep the civilian population alive. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=414.4s)]
*  And President Biden wouldn't be doing his job if he wasn't trying to get Israel to change that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=420.24s)]
*  Now, I agree with you. A loss has been left out of this way too much, but you can't ignore the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=426.24s)]
*  need for Israel to change the way they're conducting this war. What was clearly the [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  game changer, Congressman, this past week, were those World Central Kitchen workers, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  seven of them getting killed. And I do not mean to sound callous or indifferent to any of that, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=442.16s)]
*  sir. But this happens in wartime. Innocent civilians, even aid workers, are killed. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=447.6s)]
*  It's not right. It's not fair. It just is. But if that is the litmus test by which we might hold [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=453.76000000000005s)]
*  future aid to Israel, isn't that very risky? Well, look, I disagree with your premise. I [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=459.28000000000003s)]
*  disagree with somehow everything changed with World Central Kitchen. There was concern, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=466.64000000000004s)]
*  and President Biden was putting pressure. His over-the-top comment came weeks ago. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=471.44s)]
*  Look, there has been concern about the way Israel has been conducting this war from the very start. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=475.84s)]
*  And yes, there's an enormous amount of pressure involved. And you're absolutely right. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=480.71999999999997s)]
*  In a war like this, these things are going to happen. But I can also tell you that there are [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=484.48s)]
*  very specific things that Israel could do differently that would make it less likely [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=489.12s)]
*  that this would happen and allows them to still conduct their military operations. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=493.84s)]
*  Their closing of so many corridors to allow humanitarian assistance in, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=499.44s)]
*  their blocking assistance. I was at the Rafa crossing on the Egypt side about two, three, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=504.24s)]
*  a month ago. I guess it was now. And they routinely block aid from getting in for no clear, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=510.32s)]
*  apparent reason. They have a policy, and that's what happened in this case. If you try to protect [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=515.92s)]
*  these aid trucks as they go through, Israel will not allow any armed guards to protect those trucks. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=521.76s)]
*  If they see someone armed, they consider them a legitimate target, which means most of these aid [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=527.92s)]
*  trucks that are going in are being looted before they can get across the border. So these are [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=533.76s)]
*  policies that Israel can change, still conducting the war, understanding the risks that you clearly [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=538.64s)]
*  lay out. So there are things Israel can do differently to say, this is just war. We shouldn't [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=545.4399999999999s)]
*  bother Israel. I don't agree with that assessment. You can understand their reticence and the [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=549.68s)]
*  Israelis' concern about people who might look like they're the genuine aid workers and those [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=555.2s)]
*  who might not, but such is war. I do, but there's a cost to having this approach to. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=559.9200000000001s)]
*  Well said, sir. All right. I enjoyed having you on. Thank you very much. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=565.2800000000001s)]
*  Right now. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAfWQDptoO4&t=585.2s)]
