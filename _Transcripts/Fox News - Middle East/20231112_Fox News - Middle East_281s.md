*  President Biden mourning their loss while preparing for a high-stakes meeting [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=12.16s)]
*  with Chinese President Xi Jinping this week in San Francisco. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=16.72s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson live in Wilmington, Delaware where the president [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=20.64s)]
*  is spending this weekend at his home there. Hello Lucas. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=23.76s)]
*  Lucas. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=27.52s)]
*  Eric, officials say the helicopter that crashed off the coast of Cyprus in the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=29.119999999999997s)]

*  crashed in the Mediterranean Sea during a routine training mission. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=52.72s)]
*  Our service members put their lives on the line for our country every day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=56.24s)]
*  They willingly take risks to keep the American people safe and secure. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=60.4s)]
*  And as you're watching right there Eric of that file footage of showing how dangerous [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=64.32s)]
*  midair refueling is at any time especially when you're dealing with Black Hawk helicopters [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=69.12s)]
*  at nighttime. Now on Fox News Sunday Senator Mark Warner was asked by Shannon Bream [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=74.64s)]
*  if Iran was being deterred by the dozens of attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=79.12s)]
*  Here's what Senator Mark Warner had to say. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=83.76s)]
*  I think by placing both a carrier group in the Red Sea, Eastern Med, announcing that we've sent [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  an Ohio class submarine, we never normally announce that, and bombing some of the facilities [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=96.08000000000001s)]
*  outside of Iran, I think it's terribly important. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=102.48s)]
*  U.S. forces in the Middle East have been attacked nearly 50 times in less than a month. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=109.36s)]
*  Iran's proxy forces have continued launching strikes at U.S. bases targeting some of the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=113.84s)]
*  2,500 American troops in Iraq and 900 in neighboring Syria. There have been six attacks since Wednesday [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=118.72s)]
*  after a pair of U.S. Air Force F-15 Strike Eagles hit that warehouse in eastern Syria used to store [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=124.80000000000001s)]
*  weapons. The Pentagon says we're used to attack Americans in the Middle East and we're just getting [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=130.0s)]
*  this in, Eric. We're learning from our own Jennifer Griffin. There have been two more [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=134.48s)]
*  airstrikes from the U.S. Air Force today in eastern Syria. The Wall Street Journal editorial [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=138.64s)]
*  page before that news came out saying that Iran has not been deterred despite the deployment of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=143.76s)]
*  American firepower in the Middle East, saying, quote, President Biden's weak responses to attacks [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=149.12s)]
*  on U.S. forces aren't deterring Iran and its proxies, which increases the risk of escalation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=154.48s)]
*  The surgical U.S. military strikes in response aren't making Tehran think twice about hitting [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=160.48s)]
*  American troops. And what's the point of military assets if America's enemies don't fear that the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=165.92s)]
*  U.S. will use them? Now, here's President Biden's national security advisor earlier about what's [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=171.04s)]
*  next in Israel's war on Hamas. No reoccupation of Gaza, no forcible displacement of the Palestinian [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=176.32s)]
*  people. Gaza can never be used as a base for terrorism in the future and Gaza's territory [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=185.04s)]
*  should not be reduced. And President Biden will be meeting China's President Xi Jinping in San [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  Francisco on Wednesday. Eric? Lucas, you mentioned those strikes on Iranian bases in eastern Syria. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=198.48s)]
*  Any more information on those? Thankfully, no American troops have been killed, but some have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=205.12s)]
*  suffered from TBI's traumatic brain injury. So we have had some of our troops injured. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=210.24s)]
*  That's right. The Pentagon says all of those soldiers have been returned to duty. So that's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  good news there, though this breaking news about more American airstrikes today in eastern Syria. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=223.28s)]
*  This would be the third time that U.S. jets have been used to strike back at Iran's proxy [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=228.8s)]
*  forces in eastern Syria. This is largely an ungoverned area in eastern Syria, part of the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=234.24s)]
*  ISIS caliphate, if you remember those last few days in Baguz, where Benjamin Hall reported from. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=240.0s)]
*  So it's largely ungoverned area. It's where the U.S. military has been striking, not in Iraq, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=244.4s)]
*  but in Syria. So we'll have to get a battle damage assessment and find out a little bit more about [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  the targets and what was hit. Hopefully, a message aimed at Tehran. Lucas, in Wilmington, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=254.16s)]
*  Delaware, always good to see you. Lucas, thank you. Hi, everyone. I'm Brian Kilmeade. I want you to do [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2hAvhbTpA8&t=259.52s)]
