# Iran makes ‘face-saving’ attempt after ‘humiliating’ US airstrikes
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY)
*  First, here with more of the details of what a very busy day. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=0.0s)]
*  She's been working a lot of hours today and all weekend. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin's coverage has been phenomenal. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=7.12s)]
*  Jennifer, great to have you back. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=9.08s)]
*  What's the latest? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=10.96s)]
*  Thank you, Sean. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=11.96s)]
*  Well, U.S. bases across the Middle East braced for the expected Iranian retaliation for the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=13.24s)]
*  surprise and very stealthy U.S. bombing strike on Iran's three prized nuclear sites on Saturday [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=18.52s)]
*  that involved 14 30,000-pound bunker buster bombs. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Iran's response came in the form of a missile strike targeting Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=28.759999999999998s)]
*  the largest U.S. military base in the Middle East, a face saving attempt by the Iranian [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  regime to show its population the regime survived after the humiliating U.S. weekend bombing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=40.04s)]
*  A senior Qatari defense official said its military shot down 18 of the 19 missiles fired from [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=45.92s)]
*  Iran in two waves. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=52.96s)]
*  One Iranian missile hit the Al Udeid base but caused no casualties or significant damage. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=55.0s)]
*  The skies over Doha lit up with the Patriot interceptors. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=61.12s)]
*  President Trump said 14 ballistic missiles were fired, one for each of the U.S. bunker [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=65.24s)]
*  busters. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=70.4s)]
*  He thanked the emir of Qatar in a Truth Social post, quote, I want to thank Iran for giving [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=71.4s)]
*  us early notice, which made it possible for no lives to be lost and nobody to be injured. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=77.16s)]
*  Perhaps Iran can now proceed to peace and harmony in the region and I will enthusiastically [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=83.08000000000001s)]
*  encourage Israel to do the same. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=88.78s)]
*  Qatar says it was not given advance warning by Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=91.4s)]
*  Meantime, the Pentagon released this nighttime video of the American B-2 bombers as they [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  prepared to launch at 12.01 a.m. Saturday morning for their 37-hour nonstop bombing [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=100.04s)]
*  run to Iran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  The U.S. military had expected strikes on three U.S. bases to mirror the U.S. strikes [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=108.48s)]
*  on three Iranian nuclear facilities, but only Al Udeid was targeted. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=113.92s)]
*  Tonight, Bahrain, Kuwait, UAE and Iraq, all home to U.S. bases, reopened their airspace [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=119.0s)]
*  and the U.S. Embassy in Qatar lifted its shelter-in-place orders. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=124.88s)]
*  The U.S. military shone had drawn down significantly from Al Udeid and Qatar, where 5 to 10,000 [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=128.56s)]
*  American troops normally would be based. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=134.96s)]
*  Then, as the vice president was about to go on the air and speak with Bret Baer, the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=137.2s)]
*  Truth Social Post came through. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=141.28s)]
*  Israel and Iran had agreed to a ceasefire. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=143.28s)]
*  What the president called the 12-day war was over in three hours. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  That ceasefire, which was mediated by the prime minister of Qatar, will go into effect. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=149.76s)]
*  Sean? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=154.28s)]
*  All right, Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon, as always, thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=155.28s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zp17XIp42SY&t=167.04s)]
