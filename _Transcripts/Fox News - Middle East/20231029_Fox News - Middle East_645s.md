# Mark Levin: I have a serious question for Jewish Americans
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng)
*  Music [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and this is Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=12.8s)]
*  We have two great guests this evening, Governor Ron DeSantis and Robert Greenway, one of the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=16.4s)]
*  architects of the Abraham Accords. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  But before we get to our guests, I have a serious question. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=24.02s)]
*  If you are Jewish, why are you still a member of the Democrat Party? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  If you are black, why are you still a member of the Democrat Party? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=36.04s)]
*  If you are Asian, why are you still a member [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=41.1s)]
*  of the Democrat Party? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=43.86s)]
*  If you are Hispanic, why are you still a member [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  of the Democrat Party? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=49.5s)]
*  If you're part of the so-called white working class, why are you still a member of the Democrat [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=51.32s)]
*  Party and why am I asking this? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=55.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, not just because of this, the Democrat Party hates America, but think about what [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=58.16s)]
*  the Democrat Party is, was, and has become. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=64.44s)]
*  Let's take this issue of Israel and what's going on in the United States today. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=69.72s)]
*  What exactly has the Biden administration done to address the Hamas funding network [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=75.14s)]
*  in the United States that supports this group CARE and Students for Justice in Palestine? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=81.46000000000001s)]
*  Just two obvious examples. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=87.86s)]
*  CARE and members of CARE visited the White House under Obama dozens of times. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=90.78s)]
*  So did the Muslim Brotherhood. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=97.54s)]
*  CARE and members of CARE are attached to the Democrat Party even though it's a Hamas [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=101.53999999999999s)]
*  front group, and it's been proven to be, based on litigation and FBI wiretaps in the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  1990s. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=110.66s)]
*  A couple months ago, actually I think it was a month ago, there was a meeting at the Department [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=111.66s)]
*  of Homeland Security on how to combat hate and anti-Semitism. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=117.46s)]
*  There were three Islamic groups that were invited, including CARE. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=123.89999999999999s)]
*  The FBI under Democrat administrations has used CARE as outreach. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=129.22s)]
*  CARE is a part of the Democrat Party coalition. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=136.34s)]
*  Therefore, the Hamas network is part of the Democrat Party coalition. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=140.7s)]
*  And you see it on our streets, you see it in our universities, you see it among Democrats [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=147.34s)]
*  in Congress, you see it among media members who are also mostly Democrats. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=150.94s)]
*  These people who are riding in the streets and violently attacking people and carrying [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=156.22s)]
*  signs talking about exterminating Jews and on and on and on and getting rid of Israel, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=160.66s)]
*  they're not voting Republican. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=167.26s)]
*  They voted all the vote Democrat. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=169.18s)]
*  Same with these tenured professors. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=171.7s)]
*  The Democrat Party is a sort of protection racket, if you will, or an umbrella organization [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=174.02s)]
*  for the American Marxist movements. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=180.7s)]
*  And I might add, the infiltration in our country in multiple ways of Islamists. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=182.4s)]
*  It simply is. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=190.72s)]
*  And you can see it in the policy that Obama had, in the policy that Biden has, which is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=192.88s)]
*  the same as Obama, the same players that Obama had, Biden has. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=197.58s)]
*  If you're black, do you know the history of the Democrat Party? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=206.18s)]
*  Obviously, slavery, segregation, Jim Crow. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=212.24s)]
*  But what else? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=218.62s)]
*  Eugenics, which was focused on, among others, black Americans, was a major objective of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=220.18s)]
*  the so-called progressive movements in Woodrow Wilson and the Democrat Party. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=226.86s)]
*  The opposition to the Civil Rights Act right into the 1960s came mostly from the Democrats. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  And today, the Democrat Party pushes what I call civil rights Marxism. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=239.32s)]
*  It's not about equality. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=244.54s)]
*  It's about equity. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=246.66s)]
*  That's civil rights Marxism. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=248.7s)]
*  So in other words, it uses blacks and other minorities to advance an ideology that destroys [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  the family, that destroys the black culture, and destroys our communities and neighborhoods, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=257.64s)]
*  particularly in our inner cities, that are run by Democrats, many of whom are hardcore, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=263.42s)]
*  radical leftists. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=268.74s)]
*  What about the Asian community? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=270.68s)]
*  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Franklin Roosevelt rounded up 120,000 Japanese Americans and [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=272.76s)]
*  put them in internment camps. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  None of them had done anything, except they were Japanese. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=282.64s)]
*  And it was upheld by a Roosevelt-packed Supreme Court in the Korematsu decision, a disgrace. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=288.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, Mark, that's a long time ago. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=294.68s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=297.08s)]
*  Well, the Biden administration and the Democrat Party, the Democrat left-wing administrators [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=298.41999999999996s)]
*  of our colleges and universities opposed litigation that took place in the Supreme Court ruling [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=303.78s)]
*  that said that Asian Americans are not to be discriminated against because their numbers [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=312.62s)]
*  are significant in terms of admissions to colleges and so forth. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=317.97999999999996s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=321.38s)]
*  Because they score very high on these various tests and so forth. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=322.38s)]
*  And so Harvard and other colleges, what they did is they discriminated against Asians. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=325.8s)]
*  The Supreme Court said you can't. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=331.98s)]
*  Joe Biden said it was one of the worst decisions. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=334.58s)]
*  What's wrong with this radical court? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=336.78000000000003s)]
*  And they were looking for ways to get around it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=338.5s)]
*  That is, they're re-segregating our society. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=341.26s)]
*  What about Hispanic Americans? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=345.1s)]
*  Obviously, many of the people who live on our southern border are Hispanic Americans, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=347.26s)]
*  the vast majority of whom are here legally. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=353.22s)]
*  And maybe they've had ancestors who've been here for some time. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=356.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, not only is the entire country feeling the brunt of open borders, 100,000 dead with [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=359.88000000000005s)]
*  fentanyl, drug cartels, the inhumanity that's going on the border, our border communities [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=365.68s)]
*  are feeling this the most. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=371.44000000000005s)]
*  So American, Hispanic Americans are feeling the blunt of this. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=375.14000000000004s)]
*  And this is intentional. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=381.24s)]
*  This has manmade the disaster, the inhumanity on the southern border. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=383.2s)]
*  So why are Hispanic Americans still Democrats? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=387.58s)]
*  And then the white working class, the men and women who use their hands as well as their [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=393.02s)]
*  brains to get dirt under their fingernails, who actually make things and grow things and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=398.38s)]
*  produce things, some are union, most are non-union, but it doesn't matter. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  Why are they Democrats? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=412.82s)]
*  What has the Democrat Party done for them, other than besmirch them, other than smear [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=414.78s)]
*  them? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=420.96s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=422.44s)]
*  They've made their wages, they've made their lifestyles, they've made their finances, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=424.0s)]
*  poor and are in a very, very difficult situation in this country right now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=430.44s)]
*  The Democrat Party does hate America. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=435.96s)]
*  That's why I wrote the book. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=438.44s)]
*  I wrote this book. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=440.76s)]
*  I didn't have a ghostwriter write this book. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=441.78s)]
*  I don't need the money from this book. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=444.26s)]
*  I wrote this book because this party is destroying America, whether it's foreign policy or [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=446.9s)]
*  domestic policy. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=452.56s)]
*  So let's circle back. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=454.88s)]
*  Let's circle back to Hamas and CARE and Students for Justice in Palestine and all the fancy [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=457.12s)]
*  names that they use to cover up their true purposes. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=463.36s)]
*  The Democrat Party has done nothing, nothing to stop them. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=468.16s)]
*  It has done nothing to clean up our college campuses. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=473.44s)]
*  It's done the opposite. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=476.56s)]
*  It funds them. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=477.56s)]
*  It gives tenure to their professors. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  This is a Democrat Party that, even in the face of what's taking place in the Middle [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  East and Israel, how Israel was attacked, keeps our border wide open. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=486.12s)]
*  Why wouldn't terrorists come in here willy-nilly? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=491.04s)]
*  Who's going to stop them? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=492.72s)]
*  We're not vetting them. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=493.84000000000003s)]
*  Joe Biden doesn't care. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  He doesn't care about the well-being of the American people. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=497.88s)]
*  He doesn't care about the well-being, and I'll say it, of the Jewish people, particularly [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=501.04s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=505.64s)]
*  He lies to them. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=506.64s)]
*  He lies to us about how he stands with them while they're undermining their war effort [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=507.64s)]
*  at every turn, just like Obama did. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=511.88s)]
*  What has he done for the black community? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=515.6s)]
*  He's done the same that FDR did. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=517.24s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=519.36s)]
*  He hasn't lifted a finger. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=520.36s)]
*  Remember, Biden's background is as a racist and a segregationist. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=521.6s)]
*  That's what he was. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=525.36s)]
*  And not an observer, a participant. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=526.76s)]
*  So he'll use whatever ethnicity or racial group he has to for power. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=529.4s)]
*  I mentioned what he's done for the Asian community. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=534.76s)]
*  It's more like what he's done to the Asian community in supporting litigation that would [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=537.5600000000001s)]
*  prevent Asian kids based on merit from getting into Ivy League schools. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=542.54s)]
*  And the Hispanic community? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=548.16s)]
*  Well, the Hispanic community has been ravaged, as has the rest of the country from the open [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=549.72s)]
*  border policies of this administration. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=556.28s)]
*  The Democrat Party does hate America, and that's why America is losing its spirit. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=559.86s)]
*  That's why American citizens are at each other's throats. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=567.0s)]
*  That's why so many more people are impoverished than they were three years ago. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=572.3199999999999s)]
*  That's why when it comes to international relations, the rest of the world laughs at [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=577.56s)]
*  him. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=581.9599999999999s)]
*  They know he's weak. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  They know he's an appeaser. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  And among other things, they know he's not with it. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=586.12s)]
*  And yet he's going to be the nominee of the Democrat Party, because the Democrat Party [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=588.52s)]
*  thinks they're doing great. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=593.36s)]
*  Open borders, a disastrous economy, war breaking out all over the world, and Biden wants to [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=595.34s)]
*  be reelected. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=602.76s)]
*  And by the way, his media is all for it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=603.76s)]
*  The media that has been supporting Hamas, the media that has been supporting the attempt [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=605.74s)]
*  to imprison a former president, the media that has run cover for Joe Biden every step [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=610.96s)]
*  of the way, despite the fact we now know that there were 40, 40 individuals who were giving [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=616.52s)]
*  information about the Biden crime family stopped at every turn by the Department of Justice [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=623.0600000000001s)]
*  under Merrick Garland. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=628.48s)]
*  And that's the situation we're in today. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=630.44s)]
*  You will not get it anywhere else. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=miZHY448gng&t=640.96s)]
