# ‘One misfire and the whole thing blows up,’ former ambassador warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY)
*  Ambassador David Freeman, former U.S. Ambassador to Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time and good morning. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=2.64s)]
*  I want to bring you the two headlines, I think, for the moment. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu is saying no ceasefire until the hostages are released. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=7.44s)]
*  Nasrallah speaking in Lebanon on behalf of Hezbollah. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=12.72s)]
*  Seems as if the northern front that everybody's been watching for the past several weeks will serve as more of a distraction for Israel than anything else. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=16.96s)]
*  I read that today in real time as a good sign. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=28.12s)]
*  How do you see the state of the war right now, Mr. Ambassador? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=31.720000000000002s)]
*  Look, I think it's a good sign, but I really don't trust Nasrallah at all. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=36.72s)]
*  And remember, they're shooting at Israel every day from the north. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=42.92s)]
*  Israel's shooting back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=47.0s)]
*  It's incredibly volatile and one misfire and the whole thing blows up. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=49.2s)]
*  So, I mean, if Nasrallah really wants to stay out of the war, it's very simple. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=53.8s)]
*  Stop shooting at Israel and Israel won't be firing back. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=57.72s)]
*  And again, we've all seen wars spin out of control. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=60.28s)]
*  So that continues to be, I think, a huge, a huge worrying point. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=62.96s)]
*  If I can, guys, you know, I think the secretary's comments were helpful and important in terms of supporting Israel's effort to eradicate Hamas. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=68.6s)]
*  But I have to tell you, this idea that this narrative, which I think continues to be advanced [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=80.24s)]
*  in the United States, that, you know, left to their own devices, Israel would commit [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=85.6s)]
*  civilian atrocities and America is holding them back. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=90.36s)]
*  It's just absolutely not true. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=93.8s)]
*  It plays to a political base of the Biden administration in the United States, and somehow [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=95.12s)]
*  the United States is holding Israel back. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  But Israel is not targeting civilians. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=102.24s)]
*  I've been in their war rooms. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=104.56s)]
*  In 2019, there was kinetic activity with Hamas. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=106.8s)]
*  I know what they do. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=111.44s)]
*  Every time they attack, in that attack, there was a calibration of what collateral damage [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=112.56s)]
*  will occur, and they take that into consideration on every attack. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=117.84s)]
*  On top of that, you know, there are pauses constantly. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=121.68s)]
*  They're not shooting every minute. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=124.36s)]
*  I mean, you know, you just saw, you know, with Trey Yungst, I mean, there were shots [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=126.2s)]
*  fired and then there were not. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=130.28s)]
*  Then it's quiet. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=131.28s)]
*  There are pauses constantly. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=132.76s)]
*  There are people getting out of Gaza. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=134.12s)]
*  The South is generally quiet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=135.6s)]
*  People are leaving. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=138.0s)]
*  Medical supplies are getting in. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=140.16s)]
*  Israel's doing that all by itself. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=141.16s)]
*  And this idea that, you know, Israel has to be held back from their worst instincts is [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=143.56s)]
*  feeding a narrative in the United States that, as we're all seeing, is leading to, I think, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=147.8s)]
*  a very stark increase in anti-Semitism. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  I wish we would get away from that because it's not accurate and it's political. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=154.72s)]
*  David, there's also periodically they will bring up a two-state solution, which seems [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=159.16s)]
*  impossible to talk about right now, but from your perspective or the Israeli perspective, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=168.84s)]
*  and when they're in the middle of trying to respond to October 7th, that conversation [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=173.28s)]
*  seems difficult to have right now. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=177.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's really tone deaf, I think. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=179.6s)]
*  The idea that all these bad actors—and it's not just Hamas. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=182.88s)]
*  All these bad actors are somehow going to be rewarded with an independent state based [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=187.92000000000002s)]
*  upon their conduct over the last four weeks is absurd, and it's adding a real insult [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=192.4s)]
*  to the massive injury that's been inflicted on Israel. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=197.52s)]
*  Look, the Palestinian Authority, which is the alternative governing body in Judea and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=200.72s)]
*  Samaria, is an entity that pays terrorists to kill Jews. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=206.28s)]
*  It's an entity that has voiced its support for Hamas. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=210.88s)]
*  There's not a single Arab leader that borders Israel, whether Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon or [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=214.44s)]
*  Syria, not a single Arab leader that has not to a large extent sided with Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=220.92000000000002s)]
*  So who's going to govern this two-state solution? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=227.2s)]
*  Where are these peace-loving leaders coming from? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=229.36s)]
*  So yeah, look, maybe one day. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=232.4s)]
*  I'm personally against it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=234.4s)]
*  I think it will never come to be and it shouldn't come to be. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=235.56s)]
*  But for those who want to pursue that path, now is certainly not the right time. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=239.04s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=243.28s)]
*  David Freeman, the former ambassador. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=245.28s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnmPyQX2PqY&t=247.28s)]
