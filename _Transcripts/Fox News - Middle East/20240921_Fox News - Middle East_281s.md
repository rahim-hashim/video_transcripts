# Biden admin is taking a 'really dangerous' approach on this: ex-State Dept spox
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M)
*  Fox News alert Israel launching a targeted strike against Hezbollah in Beirut killing 14 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF confirmed the strike killed top Hezbollah commander that the US says was behind the 1983 [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=6.16s)]
*  Beirut barracks bombing that killed more than 300 Americans here with reaction former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortega's [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=12.42s)]
*  Morgan I think I'm just gonna bring you into a conversation. I've been having with Pete off-camera [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=20.12s)]
*  Tell me this how connected to the story earlier this week about [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=23.96s)]
*  Pagers and walkie-talkies blown up. Do you think this story is in other words? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=29.56s)]
*  Do you think those pagers were not just used as expensive as as explosive devices? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=34.56s)]
*  But as tracking devices that now led to this third strike [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=38.92s)]
*  Potentially for sure [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=44.66s)]
*  I mean what you've seen is something absolutely brilliant by the Israeli intelligence services by the IDF [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=45.56s)]
*  They have been reportedly working on this operation the pager operation for 15 years [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=51.4s)]
*  So I know Pete's been a part of this type of thing as have I and others, you know [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=57.0s)]
*  An operation that you start planning 15 years ago is just kind of unheard of when planning and so the the amount of [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=61.56s)]
*  foresight that it took to plan this and to be able to sit on this op so that means that they were sitting on it for [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=69.4s)]
*  Years and years and years collecting information and just waiting for the right moment [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=74.22s)]
*  What's really important to know is why is Israel going after Hezbollah? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=78.32s)]
*  So we've heard a lot about Hamas in the south. They of course [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=82.8s)]
*  Perpetrated the attacks on October 7th [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=86.16s)]
*  But what people forget is probably close to like 80,000 Israelis who live in northern Israel, so that's near Lebanon [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=88.2s)]
*  They have been unable to go home. They have been internally displaced since October 7th and BB Netanyahu [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=95.36s)]
*  The defense minister Gala they have warned time and time again [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=101.88s)]
*  That they had to have the ability for Israelis to go home in northern Israel and to leave leave peacefully [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=105.6s)]
*  It's also been reported [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  I would note that Hezbollah was planning a massive attack on northern Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=113.16s)]
*  And so that's why Israel did these did these pager attacks and did these other? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=117.52s)]
*  Missile attacks that went after the head of all these forces. It's important to know they've killed almost [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=123.68s)]
*  500 Hezbollah operatives since October 7th and in the last week [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=129.32s)]
*  They have gotten the heads of the radwan forces, which are the most elite [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=134.04s)]
*  Sophisticated Hezbollah fighters they're taking out the top of the organization and very precise targeted strikes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=138.2s)]
*  Whether it's through the pagers or through what we saw yesterday and overnight [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=145.0s)]
*  So when BB Netanyahu said and warned Hezbollah and said our Israeli people are going to be able to go home or else [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=148.5s)]
*  I think he meant business how [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=154.88s)]
*  Decimated would this or how big of a dramatic impact on Hezbollah would these strikes be we saw the numbers [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=157.76s)]
*  So are they significantly crippled after all of these strikes? Yes [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=164.68s)]
*  It's significant because it specifically went after the top of the leadership now has Bola has [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=170.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, they are that Iran the Islamic Republic of Iran. It's their number one terrorist group [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=176.68s)]
*  We know Iran has terrorist group that they fund around the region [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=182.02s)]
*  But Hezbollah is what Iran considers the one that sort of guards their nuclear program [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=184.92s)]
*  And so that's so Hezbollah's the crown jewel for Iran so taking out such top leadership and by the way [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=190.26s)]
*  It's also a psychological operation, you know the fact that it was their pagers that went off now [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=196.1s)]
*  It's inside and there were follow-up operations by the way for with their walkie talkies. So it's inside their head as well [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=202.3s)]
*  I would say though [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=208.62s)]
*  I would warn the Biden administration is taking a really dangerous approach on this just yesterday the guy in charge of the Middle East at [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=210.3s)]
*  the White House [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=218.02s)]
*  Basically said that they disagreed with Israel's tactics and going after Hezbollah and that they needed [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  Diplomacy in order for the Israelis to get home to northern Israel [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=224.9s)]
*  It's a load of hogwash our strongest and our closest ally in the Middle East is not even telling the Biden Harris [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=228.36s)]
*  Biden or Harris about their operation until afterwards because the Israelis do not trust Biden and Harris with [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=236.02s)]
*  Operational details to go after terrorists in advance. I think we need to really let that sink in right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=243.66s)]
*  I think my final question which you've already answered those [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=249.67999999999998s)]
*  I'll just highlight is why now because if you've been no, no if you've been working on some for 15 years, that's stunning [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=252.29999999999998s)]
*  So what predicated the execution of it now and you told us that Hezbollah was in the process of an operation against Israel [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=259.26s)]
*  Always good insight. Thank you so much Morgan Ortega's. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian kill me and I'm Ainsley Earhart [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iuSReMoRf3M&t=267.94s)]
