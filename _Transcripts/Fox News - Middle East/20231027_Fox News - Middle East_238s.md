# 'WISHY-WASHY': Biden admin called out for 'soft-peddling' Iran threat
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4)
*  Let's bring in Rebecca Grant, a national security and military analyst and international relations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=0.0s)]
*  expert, to talk further about this latest move by the U.S. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  And Rebecca, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin released a statement after this airstrike [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=9.38s)]
*  and said, Iran wants to hide its hand and deny its role in these attacks against our [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=12.64s)]
*  forces. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=16.88s)]
*  We will not let them. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=17.88s)]
*  Calling out Iran by name, saying we know that Iran operates through proxy to avoid getting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=18.88s)]
*  its hands dirty, we're not going to let you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=23.68s)]
*  So what do you think about that message? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=26.32s)]
*  What message does that send? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=28.14s)]
*  Well, this is getting serious for our U.S. forces throughout the Middle East. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=30.28s)]
*  And I'm glad that Secretary Austin said that this is clearly Iran's handiwork. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=36.64s)]
*  But I got to say, Carly, Team Biden overall, there's some wishy washy language that's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=43.14s)]
*  just out of step now with our enhanced military deployments and also with what we're asking [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=48.32s)]
*  our forces over there to do. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=54.72s)]
*  I'd like to see some stronger language. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=56.28s)]
*  I don't know why they're trying to soft pedal Iran's involvement. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=57.84s)]
*  Let's let those F-16 strikes speak for themselves. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=61.24s)]
*  So what will the weekend look like for our U.S. service members based in the Middle East? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=64.72s)]
*  Can they anticipate retaliatory airstrikes? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=69.62s)]
*  Really hard to say, but I think there's no question that these Iran-backed militias, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  which are many, many groups throughout different countries, are going to be looking for opportunities. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=79.88s)]
*  So our top priority for our forces there is missile defense protection for them. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  That's why we see the additional deployments of Patriots and other systems. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  And hey, we've also really doubled our striking power in the region with the new F-16 squadron, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  the two carriers moving in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=99.9s)]
*  But the good news is our forces there are really used to the threat from these Iran-backed [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=101.26s)]
*  militias. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=107.64s)]
*  These F-16 pilots, I'm sure this was just another day at the office for them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=108.64s)]
*  So our forces can take whatever these proxy militias can dish out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=113.76s)]
*  And that should make every American proud. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  There are Middle East countries that sort of play both sides here, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=120.84s)]
*  Jordan, just to name a few. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=125.28s)]
*  And you say Mideast governments criticize Israel, but behind the scenes they don't [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=126.46000000000001s)]
*  like Iran stirring up this crisis either. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=130.76s)]
*  So what does that mean for possible partners that Iran might be looking for down the road? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=132.68s)]
*  Well, remember, first of all, we have major military bases in Qatar. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=140.24s)]
*  And it's really true. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  They're going to criticize Israel. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=147.76000000000002s)]
*  But behind the scenes, Iran's chaos, which of course is backed by China, is not something [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  that anybody in this region wants. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=155.12s)]
*  And that's why we saw success with the Abraham Accords. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=156.8s)]
*  We saw Israel and Saudi approaching some agreements for the future. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=160.96s)]
*  The basic thing is they know Iran is creating far too much mischief and chaos. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=165.72s)]
*  This is bad for business. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=170.16s)]
*  This is bad all the way around. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=171.32s)]
*  So there is criticism in public, but really no one in this region wants to see Iran expand [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  this war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=178.72s)]
*  None of the legitimate governments do. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=179.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=181.0s)]
*  And you mentioned China. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=182.0s)]
*  There is also Russia. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=183.0s)]
*  And a group of high ranking members of Hamas were in Russia yesterday. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=184.0s)]
*  They met with Vladimir Putin. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=187.52s)]
*  And then they released a statement afterwards praising Putin's position on this conflict. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=189.20000000000002s)]
*  So if there were any questions whether Russia supports terrorism or not before this, there's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=193.32s)]
*  your answer. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=197.92000000000002s)]
*  Where does Russia factor into all of this? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=199.28s)]
*  You know, isn't that just crazy? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=202.16s)]
*  And of course, Russia has purchased drones from Iran to use against Ukraine. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=203.68s)]
*  And hey, those F-16s doing that strike, you know, Russia still has aircraft in Syria operating [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=208.76000000000002s)]
*  in that airspace. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=214.24s)]
*  So I know the Russians saw that strike get carried out. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=215.32000000000002s)]
*  It's a good message to send to them as well. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=219.44s)]
*  Don't get any more involved. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=222.04000000000002s)]
*  Love that message. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H56oorBRQr4&t=224.32000000000002s)]
