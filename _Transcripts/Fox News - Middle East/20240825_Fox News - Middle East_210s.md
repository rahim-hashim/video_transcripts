# ‘GREAT MOVE’: Israel’s preemptive strike prevented a third war
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w)
*  Joining me now lieutenant general Keith Kellogg general welcome back good to see you [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=0.0s)]
*  What do you make of what we've seen over the last 24 hours? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=4.0s)]
*  There's some say it's provocative others say it's a real pushback to shut down what could have happened. Yeah, she and I thanks for having me [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=6.36s)]
*  I thought it was a great move [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=12.64s)]
*  Look at the preemptive strike was very very important because if they had launched the strike they the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=13.76s)]
*  Hezbollah into in Israel with thousands of missiles and they were talking thousands [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=18.88s)]
*  What would have happened with the loss of lives of Israelis and also the facilities? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=23.64s)]
*  It would have pushed the Israelis into a doctrine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=27.54s)]
*  They called the he and what the he is called [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=30.94s)]
*  Disproportionate response and you I think what they did they prevented the next or the third [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=33.62s)]
*  Israeli Lebanese war and that is smart in and because of that [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=39.1s)]
*  I think it's kind of reset the battlefield there and it's it's important they did it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=42.7s)]
*  I think they did it quite well the attacks will continue [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=46.74s)]
*  They're just diminishing the ability of Hezbollah to attack [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=49.82s)]
*  You know I have to go back when you think about what what's happened there is really the United States hasn't played a part [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=52.46s)]
*  Major role there and kind of deescalating situation because President Biden hasn't done a lot in talking to Netanyahu [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=57.5s)]
*  Vice-president Harris hasn't done very much [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=63.54s)]
*  I mean [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=65.12s)]
*  She's actually stiff [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=65.38s)]
*  Netanyahu when he came here and did a joint the session of Congress when he spoke and you've got Blinken going over there on his [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=66.62s)]
*  Ninth trip no ceasefire and you got the National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan heading in China instead of going to the Middle East now [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=72.04s)]
*  I know CQ Brown's gonna be there the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=77.78s)]
*  But you kind of got to focus in on what's gonna happen here and prevent something [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=80.62s)]
*  Into the future and they haven't done it but the Israelis have done it so the Israelis have done actually is [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=84.69999999999999s)]
*  Reset deterrence in the region [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=89.97999999999999s)]
*  I think it's smart and I think it's put the Hezbollah on their on their back foot and it's clearly put the Iranians on the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=91.47999999999999s)]
*  Back foot that they haven't done anything at all well, so we do have assets in the region [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=97.22s)]
*  We beat up our presence this administration keeps publicly saying Israel has every right to defend itself [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=101.34s)]
*  And we will back them in that but where do we go from here because you mentioned? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=105.86s)]
*  We've still got the threat out there looming from Iran saying we're gonna take action when we decide [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=109.02s)]
*  You've got Hezbollah and never mind what's going on in Gaza. I mean Israel is stretched in a lot of different positions [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=113.36s)]
*  Yeah, the problem you get is if it's something like this extends [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=119.36s)]
*  Which it's done it makes it harder to put back in the box to make it go put it in [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  Into a situation which is sustainable and peace in the region and that is because frankly kind of back when we said well [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=127.52s)]
*  There's pox on both sides of the house wrong the way you handle that is you tell the entire region you tell the world [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=133.12s)]
*  We are behind the Israelis full stop [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=138.68s)]
*  There's a good side and the bad side we need to do it because we haven't done it [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=141.32s)]
*  we've created a seam a gap and [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=145.08s)]
*  Adversaries look for seams and gaps and they've basically done that and so they say okay [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=147.34s)]
*  We can attack because the United States is not going to come back hard [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=151.56s)]
*  And I think how you have to reset the fight you have to tell everybody in the region [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  Who were for and who were not for and we really haven't done that so it's gonna take a bit to put it back [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=158.28s)]
*  In the box because Hezbollah is gonna keep attacking [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=164.48000000000002s)]
*  Iran's gonna keep supporting the attackers in Hezbollah. I think the mosque fight is virtually over. I think Israelis has kind of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=166.88s)]
*  Solved that problem look when the leader of Hamas has said I [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  Wanted to want if we have peace discussions and we have a ceasefire. I want to make sure that I'm not a target Sinwar [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=178.23999999999998s)]
*  No, you you started that fight. You're you know you're at the risk at risk right now [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=184.0s)]
*  But I think that fight is virtually over now that Israelis can pivot to Hezbollah [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=188.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, we know those ceasefire negotiations will continue in the coming days in Egypt primarily general. Thank you always great to see you [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=192.52s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. I'm Steve juicy [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFwDykIPv7w&t=198.44s)]
