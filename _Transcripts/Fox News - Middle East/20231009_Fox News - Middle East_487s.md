# Kevin McCarthy: Biden canâ€™t pull a lid when the world is watching
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4)
*  House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who did not rule out jumping back into the speakership race today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, thank you very much. Kevin McCarthy. Good to have you with us congressman [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=6.32s)]
*  Why did you decide to speak out so forcefully on this issue today? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=10.5s)]
*  Given that you are no longer speaker of the house, sir. If you watched [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  Every single year I've been in Congress. I have led the freshman Republicans over to Israel [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=19.04s)]
*  I made it in a bipartisan as well [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=24.36s)]
*  My first trip as speaker was to Israel to speak at the 75th anniversary [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=26.52s)]
*  At the Knesset of the creation of their country only the second American speaker to do that [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=30.64s)]
*  I know that there's no greater ally than we have as Israel. I [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=35.56s)]
*  the atrocities that I watched and Martha I've got to tell you Fox is reporting and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=39.92s)]
*  Trey Yanks is probably one of the best reporting I have seen live what is happening right now [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=45.32s)]
*  But we cannot stay silent the president cannot put a lid when the world is watching [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=51.2s)]
*  What we have found is this new administration the appeasement of paying for? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=56.480000000000004s)]
*  Hostages is it has made it more emboldened to take Americans. We now have nine Americans dead. This cannot be Afghanistan [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=61.08s)]
*  We cannot leave one American behind. We should also stand shoulder to shoulder with Israel supply the weapons [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=68.38s)]
*  They need you know the fear I have I've been to every part of this [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=74.64s)]
*  I've watched the Iron Dome there what the what the Hamas will do is send [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=78.54s)]
*  Dumb rockets at the beginning to try to wipe out all the Iron Dome has then send precision-guided [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=83.02s)]
*  We need to make sure they have all the weaponry [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=88.46000000000001s)]
*  They need so it won't be that way and we need to go after because in this new administration [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=91.86s)]
*  Iran is financially stronger. They're funding more terrorism around the world [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=96.98s)]
*  If you look at the foreign world currencies holding they only had in 2020 4 billion now [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=100.84s)]
*  They have 70 billion they gave us assurances [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=106.32s)]
*  They would tell us when they provided that 60 billion that they could always pull it back [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=108.96s)]
*  They should freeze it today while it's in cutter [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=112.8s)]
*  They should put sanctions on their oil production when Biden first took office [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=115.03999999999999s)]
*  They were only producing 400,000 barrels a day today [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=119.32s)]
*  They're producing 3 million barrels at oil being $100 a barrel [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=122.22s)]
*  This is where they're becoming stronger and funding and for the idea [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  That our Secretary of State doesn't know if Iran was involved in the Wall Street Journal knows more [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  We need to reassess our own Intel failure here and make sure we secure our own border of what's happening [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=135.24s)]
*  We're gonna ask about that in just a moment [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=141.36s)]
*  Obviously, it's been a rough week in the House of Representatives and you know, Matt Gaetz is speaking out again saying that [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  Wondering, you know why you're inserting. I [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=153.4s)]
*  Don't think that other countries think about Kevin McCarthy's speakership quite as much as Kevin McCarthy does [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=156.28s)]
*  There is no ask from Israel that we are unable to meet because it's going to take us a few days to pick a new speaker [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=161.72s)]
*  So you described a lack of leadership right now based on the shakeup last week [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=168.52s)]
*  Why is that there? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=174.12s)]
*  I mean, I know you think that it feels like the speaker pro tempore ought to be able to do [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=175.68s)]
*  Anything that you could have done in that spot [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=179.68s)]
*  That seems like the safest place for the country to be and are you considering putting your name back in to run again? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=181.6s)]
*  Look the conference decides all that this isn't about the speakership [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=187.4s)]
*  This is about where we're currently serving watch what happened in Israel where nine Americans died eight hundreds Israelis [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=190.56s)]
*  That's the equivalent of thirty thousand Americans if it happened here [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=197.0s)]
*  This is happening because of weak leadership the president puts a lid on where as anybody else. I am still a member of Congress [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=201.16s)]
*  I understand the relationship between America and Israel [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=208.4s)]
*  I have dear friends in the leadership there and living there and I'm not gonna sit back and do nothing [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=211.16s)]
*  What I have found what's going on if we had listened to Matt Gaetz [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=217.28s)]
*  We would be in a government shutdown right now. So our own troops wouldn't being being paid [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=220.8s)]
*  What strength would we have in the world then if eight people want to side with all the Democrats for their own personal beliefs? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=225.72s)]
*  That's fine [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=232.88s)]
*  But I'm elected to go serve and I'm not going to sit back and watch what's happening around the world and be quiet because the rest [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=233.76s)]
*  of leadership won't [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=240.08s)]
*  You point out all of the time that you've spent there your relationships there [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=242.24s)]
*  If asked to run again by the conference, will you? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  Look, that's a conference decision. They could decide which way they're gonna go for this conference [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=250.72s)]
*  Look, I'm a conservative that wants to govern [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=255.72s)]
*  but if we have a majority and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=257.72s)]
*  96 percent want to go one way but four percent gets to decide what happens [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=260.2s)]
*  That's not a majority and the idea that Matt Gaetz is going to divide a gates a gates a mace [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=264.56s)]
*  And a Pelosi decision on who's going to be our speaker that's wrong, but the conference will decide that but this has nothing to do with that [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=272.22s)]
*  Look at the world in which we're living. We got this axis of evil from [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=279.66s)]
*  Iran Russia and China three years ago under the Trump administration. We did not have war in Europe [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=285.02s)]
*  We did not have war in Israel. We had peace. We didn't have oil at $100 a barrel [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=290.9s)]
*  We should sanction Iran's oil and we should reproduce that in America where we have the capability and it'd be a more [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=296.18s)]
*  Environmentally sound why don't we make America strong? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=303.78s)]
*  We've got an open border where we have caught a hundred and fifty one people on the FBI terrorist watch list in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=306.38s)]
*  2019 that number was zero they're coming across our border from 160 different countries [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=313.3s)]
*  What are they doing? Do they have any cells here? Who are they talking to? I know in California [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=318.58s)]
*  We had two people coming from Yemen. What do they want to do to us and we have an administration that goes silent [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=323.06s)]
*  They could have a barbecue, but the president can't talk to the world and when they're looking for leadership [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=328.88s)]
*  What can be done to give the speaker pro tempore more power? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=334.86s)]
*  Is that something that you're gonna spearhead and can that rule be changed right now? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=339.42s)]
*  Given what's going on and the urgent need for leadership from Congress and from the White House [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=344.02s)]
*  Look this is new territory [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=349.84s)]
*  This was only put in after 9-eleven [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=351.4s)]
*  But I would believe if this was put in after 9-eleven wanting to make sure someone can serve as speaker [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  They should have the power to serve as speaker to the new person is elected [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=358.08s)]
*  I actually believe the individual should be able to move the challenge here is that way we can't do anything until we elect a speaker [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=361.9s)]
*  Now I have a number of members that didn't want to have a continuing resolution a number of members who didn't want to vote for [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  But because I kept government open eight of them decided they could go with the Democrats and and stymie our entire [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=375.52s)]
*  Government for their own personal beliefs when we've got the world look if you look at what's happening in the world today [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=382.24s)]
*  It looks a lot like the 1930s. We've got challenges with it this axis of evil. We've got war in different locations [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  We've got five embassies that had to be [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=396.4s)]
*  Removed Americans we've got Americans dead being held hostage. We got a president that puts a lid on it by noon [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=398.91999999999996s)]
*  This is not a time for people to sit back [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=406.08s)]
*  This is a time to show leadership be calm, but really give the right direction [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  We should show the world that we stand with a with Israel that we're going to fund their ability [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=413.71999999999997s)]
*  We should be very clear that we're we stand with them that Hamas has to be destroyed [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=418.5s)]
*  Not weakened but destroyed we have to understand that it's coming from Iran that there should be punishments for this [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=424.59999999999997s)]
*  We should refreeze the money sanction their oil production and have America produce that oil so we're stronger and have resources [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=430.36s)]
*  Understood [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=437.56s)]
*  Let me ask you this. This is a very important week for the house. So today is Monday [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=438.8s)]
*  Do you expect that there will be a new speaker of the house by Wednesday? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=443.36s)]
*  I believe we have the capability to do it. We'll come into conference tonight. We'll have our debates tomorrow [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=448.08s)]
*  We'll have an election on Wednesday and as far as right now [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IeTTgIr6L4&t=453.12s)]
