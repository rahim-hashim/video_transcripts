# New details reveal how US missed deadly drone strike in Jordan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY)
*  We begin with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=0.0s)]
*  America's foreign policy in the hands of President Biden [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=1.96s)]
*  is proving to be deadly. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=5.44s)]
*  Iran's paid for and trained terrorists [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=7.48s)]
*  are hitting our military men and women at will. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=9.92s)]
*  Look at the map. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=13.44s)]
*  Is Biden even up to the job of protecting Americans [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=15.4s)]
*  in the Middle East? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=19.68s)]
*  And even at home, we'll get into that later in the hour. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=20.88s)]
*  Three of our US service members were killed over the weekend. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=24.16s)]
*  34 were injured. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=28.36s)]
*  US officials identifying the terrorists. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=30.439999999999998s)]
*  They are Iran-backed, of course. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=33.8s)]
*  All eyes now on our commander in chief [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=36.08s)]
*  and his administration. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=38.96s)]
*  What will they do? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=40.64s)]
*  Do they even know what to do? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=41.76s)]
*  And why was nothing done before it came to this point? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=43.76s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=48.16s)]
*  You are in the Faulkner Focus. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=49.4s)]
*  Just a few minutes ago, we saw, for the first time [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=51.4s)]
*  since he was in the hospital, the nation's defense secretary [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=58.32s)]
*  First day back in the office after two weeks in the hospital [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=60.68s)]
*  and recovering. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=65.36s)]
*  He said he was able to work from home. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=66.2s)]
*  And his first public appearance since the fatal attacks [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  on our troops. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=73.0s)]
*  Now remember how long that's been going on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=74.72s)]
*  104 days, October 17th. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=77.76s)]
*  The first time we've seen him publicly on that. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=81.72s)]
*  The drone attack happening in northeastern Jordan, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=85.08000000000001s)]
*  near its borders with both Syria and Iraq, and the region [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  has been hit over and over and over in the recent months, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=93.12s)]
*  as I just said, 104 days. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  Congress wants more from President Biden, don't we all? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=100.12s)]
*  Their demands now. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=105.44000000000001s)]
*  We got to reestablish deterrence with regard to Iran. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  We're seeing the result. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=112.52000000000001s)]
*  More Americans killed, wars in the Middle East. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=114.36s)]
*  The appeasement policy of the Biden administration [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=116.84s)]
*  has completely failed. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=119.08s)]
*  Our enemies certainly smell weakness out of the White House. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=120.24s)]
*  There's no doubt about it. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=124.08s)]
*  Most of the attacks since the middle of October, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=126.0s)]
*  at least 160 of them. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=128.68s)]
*  Look at that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Just since October 17th. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=133.4s)]
*  And the commander in chief ordered only responding 15 [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=135.88s)]
*  times. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=139.84s)]
*  And the criticism from generals has been, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=140.72s)]
*  even those 15 times were woefully undergrade [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=142.84s)]
*  for what we needed to do. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=146.4s)]
*  General Jack Keene has been saying it for months, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=148.56s)]
*  that it is not the way to play the game, at least not to win it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=152.56s)]
*  To deter the proxies themselves by hitting them [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=158.28s)]
*  will not be sufficient. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  We have got to go after Iran. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=163.8s)]
*  Iran doesn't care how many rockets and missiles [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=166.52s)]
*  we destroy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=169.4s)]
*  And the administration doesn't get it. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=170.72s)]
*  They don't care how many rockets and missiles are destroyed [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=173.0s)]
*  or how many proxies are killed as a result of our strikes. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=176.20000000000002s)]
*  What they do care about is the resources that they own. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=180.44s)]
*  Republican Congressman Mike Walsh in focus now. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=184.08s)]
*  Former Army Special Forces with multiple combat tours [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=186.72s)]
*  in Afghanistan and Middle East and Africa. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=190.64000000000001s)]
*  First though, let's go straight to the Pentagon. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=193.84s)]
*  Our chief national security correspondent, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=196.0s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=198.68s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=200.96s)]
*  Harris, we're getting the first indications [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=201.96s)]
*  of who may have been behind the drone attack [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=203.8s)]
*  that killed three US troops while they were sleeping [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=206.24s)]
*  in their barracks, injuring 34, eight of whom [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=209.12s)]
*  had to be medevaced to Landstuhl in Germany. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=211.96s)]
*  President Biden has said the US will respond. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=214.72s)]
*  Sunday's attack, as you mentioned, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=217.36s)]
*  was the 160th attack by Iranian proxy forces [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=219.04s)]
*  targeting US troops in Iraq, Syria, and now Jordan. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=222.96s)]
*  The al-Nujaba Islamic resistance movement, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=226.76s)]
*  the Shia proxies in Iraq, called on US troops to quote, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=230.36s)]
*  leave today before tomorrow, adding the quote, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=233.36s)]
*  the resistance fighters mock them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=236.68s)]
*  The US killed a leader of the Nujaba group [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=238.84s)]
*  on January 4th in a drone strike in Baghdad. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=242.0s)]
*  Iran's intelligence minister tried to deny [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=245.36s)]
*  his country's involvement in the attack on US troops. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=248.04000000000002s)]
*  Host, are you here today? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=253.88s)]
*  We're hearing from Secretary Austin, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=256.47999999999996s)]
*  but the Iranian intelligence minister said, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  look, the resistance in the region takes action [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=261.2s)]
*  against America's aggressive presence [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=264.0s)]
*  based on its own decisions and policy. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=266.36s)]
*  It acts based on what it deems right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=268.76s)]
*  We just heard from Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=271.64s)]
*  as he was meeting with NATO Secretary General, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=274.32s)]
*  Jens Stoltenberg. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=276.8s)]
*  Let me start with my outrage for the deaths [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  of three brave US troops. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=282.64s)]
*  I am proud to say that I am proud [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=284.84000000000003s)]
*  to have saved US troops in Jordan [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=286.76s)]
*  and for the other troops who were wounded. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=289.48s)]
*  The president and I will not tolerate attack on US forces [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=292.8s)]
*  and we will take all necessary actions [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  to defend the US and our troops. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=299.52000000000004s)]
*  Now, at this important time, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=302.92s)]
*  I'm glad to be back at the Pentagon. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  I feel good and am recovering well, but still recovering. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  US troops while they were sleeping in their barracks [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=312.04s)]
*  at a small outpost known as Tower 22, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=314.64s)]
*  where 350 American troops are stationed, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=317.2s)]
*  providing logistical support to the American Special Forces [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=320.4s)]
*  based across the border in Syria, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=323.96s)]
*  part of the counter ISIS fight. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=325.8s)]
*  This outpost has been there since 2015 [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=327.76s)]
*  and is strategically located [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=330.6s)]
*  where Jordan, Syria and Iraq come together. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=332.48s)]
*  Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, General C.Q. Brown, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=335.2s)]
*  spoken in an interview taped before this attack. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=337.44s)]
*  We want to ensure that we take away capability [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=341.48s)]
*  while we protect our forces at the same time, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=344.52000000000004s)]
*  not have this broaden into a much wider conflict. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=347.0s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting exclusively, Harris, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=352.32s)]
*  that the way that the drone got into the base at Tower 22 [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=355.88s)]
*  is that the counter drone measures [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=360.0s)]
*  thought that it was a US drone [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=362.68s)]
*  that was coming back to the base. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  So clearly that is something [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=366.76s)]
*  that they will be looking at very closely in the coming days [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=368.59999999999997s)]
*  as they investigate how this terrible tragedy occurred. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=371.76s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I guess my first question [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=374.84s)]
*  would be how well the enemy knows us. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=376.84s)]
*  And I don't mean those proxies, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=378.59999999999997s)]
*  those people who are paid in trade, I mean Iran. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=380.2s)]
*  I mean, they watch us closely. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=382.71999999999997s)]
*  I have just a fast question for you, Jennifer. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=384.12s)]
*  Has there been any indication of how whatever retaliation [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  there would be from the United States military [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  per the commander in chief, Joe Biden, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=392.52s)]
*  be different than the lesser than that we saw [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  in the buildup to this point? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=397.36s)]
*  Generals have criticized it as being lesser [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=398.8s)]
*  than it needed to be to deter. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=400.76s)]
*  Based on conversations that I've had [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=403.0s)]
*  that I think this is a turning point. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=404.92s)]
*  Once US troops were killed, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=406.88s)]
*  I was always told there are many, many targets, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=408.8s)]
*  some of them including Iranian targets, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=411.28s)]
*  that will be presented to the president. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=413.68s)]
*  It will be his choice in the end, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=415.52s)]
*  but there is a campaign plan, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=417.44s)]
*  and the question is which targets will be chosen, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=419.68s)]
*  and that will be up to the White House. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=422.32s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin, thank you very much. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=424.03999999999996s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=426.28s)]
*  President Biden yesterday promising action [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=427.36s)]
*  against the attacks on American service members. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=429.52s)]
*  We lost three brave soldiers [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=433.4s)]
*  attacking one of our bases. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=436.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=438.4s)]
*  And I ask you to hold the silence [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=439.71999999999997s)]
*  for all three of those small soldiers. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=441.48s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=443.68s)]
*  And we shall respond. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=451.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, we put some of the words up on the screen for you [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=453.8s)]
*  because he is difficult to understand a lot. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=456.48s)]
*  But just two weeks ago, the president assured Americans [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=460.4s)]
*  he had the Iran situation under control. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=463.12s)]
*  Remember this? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=465.64s)]
*  I've already delivered the message to Iran. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=471.12s)]
*  They know not to do anything. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=472.84s)]
*  Do you continue bombing the U.S. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=474.48s)]
*  if the attacks don't stop, sir? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=476.44s)]
*  Say that again? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=479.44s)]
*  We're good. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=480.28s)]
*  Bombing the Houthis if the attacks don't stop. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=481.16s)]
*  Do you continue with the strikes, sir? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=483.32s)]
*  We will make sure that we respond to the Houthis [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=484.88s)]
*  as they continue this outrageous behavior. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=487.16s)]
*  Are we in the factor proxy war, Iran? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=489.04s)]
*  Say again? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=491.96s)]
*  Are we in the factor proxy war? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=492.8s)]
*  No. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=494.04s)]
*  Joining me now, Republican Congressman Mike Walsh [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=496.44s)]
*  of Florida, member of the House Armed Services, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=498.68s)]
*  Foreign Affairs and Intelligence Committees, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=501.16s)]
*  and also a former U.S. Army Special Forces commander. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=503.08s)]
*  And we thank you for all of your service. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=506.88s)]
*  You heard the president there. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=508.6s)]
*  Are we in a proxy war with Iran? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=509.68s)]
*  And he said after having to repeat the question, no. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=512.44s)]
*  Your reaction to that? [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=517.48s)]
*  Well, Harris, here's the message [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=519.24s)]
*  that Iran has gotten very clearly. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=520.96s)]
*  They clearly didn't get the message to stop [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=524.52s)]
*  that Biden thought that they got. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=526.84s)]
*  The message that they've received is, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=529.84s)]
*  yes, they're in a proxy war with us. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=531.6800000000001s)]
*  They are unleashing their militias, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=534.52s)]
*  not just on Israel, but on us, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=537.36s)]
*  and on global shipping through the Houthis. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=539.52s)]
*  And they've gotten the message loud and clear [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=541.8000000000001s)]
*  that they can get away with it. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=544.08s)]
*  And not only can they get away with it, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=545.76s)]
*  that to the extent we do respond, it'll be feckless. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=548.24s)]
*  I've talked to soldiers out in the field [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=552.08s)]
*  and to commanders that are out in the Middle East right now. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=554.72s)]
*  We're bombing empty warehouses in the middle of the night [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=557.16s)]
*  so that the administration can check the box [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  to look like they're doing something in response. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=563.72s)]
*  But they are still beholden to this appeasement strategy [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=566.52s)]
*  when it comes to Iran. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=570.6s)]
*  And you heard the chairman of the Joint Chiefs, CQ Brown. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=571.56s)]
*  If you listen very carefully, whether it's Kirby, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=574.52s)]
*  whether it's him, whether it's the president, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=577.16s)]
*  they end every statement of we're gonna defend ourselves, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=579.28s)]
*  but we don't want this thing to spread. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  And what Iran hears from that is, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=585.0799999999999s)]
*  well, let's take it to the next level [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=587.4399999999999s)]
*  and see what we can get away with next time. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=590.1999999999999s)]
*  And now we have three dead service members because of it [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=592.4s)]
*  that many of us have been warning. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=596.08s)]
*  Eventually, one of these missiles, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=598.72s)]
*  one of these drones are gonna get through. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=600.0400000000001s)]
*  And when you're trying to play defense constantly, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=602.0s)]
*  rather than punching back in a meaningful way, [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=605.0s)]
*  this blood is on this administration's hands, period. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=609.24s)]
*  And they need to take responsibility for it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=613.2s)]
*  And I don't know if you heard Jennifer Griffin. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=615.52s)]
*  She said that from the indications [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=618.0400000000001s)]
*  that she's getting at the Pentagon [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=620.32s)]
*  that this is a turning point. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=621.8000000000001s)]
*  My question was, how will this look different [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=623.2s)]
*  from the other times we have retaliated? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=626.76s)]
*  That was her answer. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=627.88s)]
*  So we'll have to watch and report that, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=628.8399999999999s)]
*  but I'm taking it you don't believe that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=631.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, I don't think, don't worry about what I believe. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=634.76s)]
*  I don't think the Iranians believe it. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=639.16s)]
*  I don't think the militias in Iraq believe it. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=641.68s)]
*  I don't think the Houthis or Hezbollah or Hamas believe it. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=645.16s)]
*  Right now, you can have all the military capability [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=649.8s)]
*  in the world. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=654.72s)]
*  And by the way, there's an opportunity cost. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=655.5600000000001s)]
*  We're stripping from places around China [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  and ships and things that should be in maintenance, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=661.0400000000001s)]
*  soldiers that should be resting. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=663.64s)]
*  To surge in the Middle East, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=665.52s)]
*  you can have all that capability, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=666.6800000000001s)]
*  but if our enemies don't believe we have the political will [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=667.88s)]
*  to use it in a way that's gonna hurt them, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=671.12s)]
*  not their proxies, not empty warehouses [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=673.8000000000001s)]
*  in the middle of the desert, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=676.64s)]
*  but them, then they're going to continue to push. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=677.76s)]
*  That's how the Middle East works. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=680.64s)]
*  They only respect strength and they only, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=682.24s)]
*  they need to believe that there's gonna be serious costs [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=685.72s)]
*  imposed to, you know what? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=689.04s)]
*  It's just not worth messing with the Americans anymore. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=690.5600000000001s)]
*  So look, I wanna dig deeper into some of the reporting. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=693.08s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin just brought this to our attention. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=696.4s)]
*  Of course, the Wall Street Journal broke it. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=698.76s)]
*  They originally reported that the US official [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=700.36s)]
*  now has confirmed to Fox News, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=702.88s)]
*  the Iran proxy drone that got past our defenses [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  for Dower 22 because it was mistaken for US drone [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=710.16s)]
*  expected to return to the base at the same time. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=714.04s)]
*  This has now been confirmed by a US official. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=717.56s)]
*  Now, what I said to Jennifer moments ago was, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=720.4399999999999s)]
*  how well does the enemy know us? [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=723.64s)]
*  And I don't mean all those proxies paid for terrorists. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=725.64s)]
*  I'm talking about Iran, that they can do this. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=728.4399999999999s)]
*  Well, Harris, at this point, I'm speculating [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=732.52s)]
*  and we'll ask for briefings on exactly what happened. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=735.0799999999999s)]
*  Did our defensive measures fail? [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=738.88s)]
*  Have they captured one of our drones [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=741.3199999999999s)]
*  and reverse engineered theirs? [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=743.24s)]
*  This is the cat and mouse game that's going on, [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=745.0799999999999s)]
*  but a bigger picture, we're shooting down [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=748.68s)]
*  these 30, $40,000 drones with two to $3 million missiles. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=751.24s)]
*  It's not sustainable and from my position [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=757.8399999999999s)]
*  as the chairman of military readiness, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=761.4799999999999s)]
*  we're gonna be pressing the Pentagon. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=762.9599999999999s)]
*  How are we reacting? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=764.68s)]
*  When you can throw thousands of these things [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=766.6s)]
*  at very little cost, you can literally buy them [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=768.8000000000001s)]
*  on Chinese websites like Alibaba [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=771.08s)]
*  and yet we have these super elaborate systems [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=774.28s)]
*  that are being- [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=777.52s)]
*  The same kind they're using you can buy [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=778.36s)]
*  on the website of Alibaba? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=780.32s)]
*  Look at my Twitter feed. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=781.6800000000001s)]
*  I put up a screenshot of one. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=783.0400000000001s)]
*  And it did that much damage. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=787.52s)]
*  That's a broader issue of how we have to adjust [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=788.36s)]
*  in the tactical space, but strategically, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=791.32s)]
*  we have a fundamental in this administration [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=795.32s)]
*  misunderstanding of deterrence. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=798.0s)]
*  They're so obsessed with non-escalation [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=799.96s)]
*  that it's actually inviting escalation [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=802.8000000000001s)]
*  and now people are dead because of it. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=805.36s)]
*  Yeah, and you've opened everybody's eyes. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=806.96s)]
*  You said whenever they stop talking, they say, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=808.96s)]
*  but we don't want to widen this thing. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=810.7600000000001s)]
*  We don't want it to spread. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=814.2800000000001s)]
*  It is spreading. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=815.6400000000001s)]
*  It's now killing us. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=816.48s)]
*  That's a green light to Tehran. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=817.6s)]
*  Oh my goodness. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=819.36s)]
*  And until they reverse course and dry up the cash in Tehran, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=820.2s)]
*  they're gonna have all the resources they need [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=822.7600000000001s)]
*  to keep fueling the fire. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=824.8399999999999s)]
*  When you get going on those conferences, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=826.7199999999999s)]
*  I want to directly bring you back and educate us [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=829.1999999999999s)]
*  on what you're gonna push for on the Hill. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=832.12s)]
*  The Secretary of Defense is back today. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=834.24s)]
*  He says he's been working from home. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=836.52s)]
*  We'll watch to see if that has any kind of an impact too. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=838.3599999999999s)]
*  Congressman Walz, it's always great to have you in focus. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=841.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=844.16s)]
*  All right, thanks, Harris. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e099pKYL5dY&t=845.1999999999999s)]
