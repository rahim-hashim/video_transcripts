# Israel strikes targeting people who filmed massacres
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs)
*  It's about 1 30 in the afternoon in Israel right now and Secretary of State Anthony Blinken [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=0.0s)]
*  and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are meeting at IDF headquarters in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  We expect them to give a news conference very shortly. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=11.66s)]
*  They are running behind. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=14.48s)]
*  Meanwhile moments ago Israel taking direct hits from Hamas. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=16.28s)]
*  As Egypt and Jordan announced aid for Palestinians trapped in the war-torn Gaza Strip. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=20.64s)]
*  Alright Trey Yanks is on the ground with the latest. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  Trey you're seeing new airstrikes right now correct? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=28.2s)]
*  Yeah guys you might end up hearing it here. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=31.0s)]
*  The Israelis have been hammering the northern part of the Gaza Strip one time after another [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=34.56s)]
*  hitting different areas along the border. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=38.8s)]
*  Generally when they're targeting the same area multiple times it means that they're [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=41.88s)]
*  trying to hit Hamas or Islamic Jihad tunnels because they have to strike at the same location [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=45.0s)]
*  to get that far underground. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  We hear these blasts in the distance and then you hear the fighter jets overhead as they [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=52.36s)]
*  come back into Israeli territory. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=56.24s)]
*  They do have to worry about anti-aircraft missiles. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=58.28s)]
*  They have these missiles inside Gaza that have been smuggled in generally through Egypt [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=60.52s)]
*  and it can be an incredibly dangerous thing for both fighter jets and for helicopters [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=65.64s)]
*  that strike Gaza as they fly around that airspace. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=71.2s)]
*  I do want to show you the scene here and you hear just off in the distance another one [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  of those strikes but I want to show you here the wall behind me. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=78.12s)]
*  This is the scene of a rocket attack that took place just about an hour and a half ago [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=81.96000000000001s)]
*  here in southern Israel in the town of Sderot. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=86.64s)]
*  These are shrapnel marks in the side of a wall and this just gives you a sense of the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=89.36s)]
*  damage. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=93.12s)]
*  My cameraman panning down here to the blood on the ground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=94.12s)]
*  There were people here at the time that were moderately injured and thankfully they're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=96.62s)]
*  right next to a medical evacuation point so there's four or five ambulances in the distance. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=100.48s)]
*  They were able immediately to get the injured here and take them to a local hospital and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  if you come over here you actually see where the rocket slammed into the ground. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=110.88s)]
*  Right here, this on the ground, pieces of shrapnel from that rocket fired from Gaza [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=115.2s)]
*  littered this area. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  It is just a scene that is not unique to southern Israel, also central Israel as Hamas fires [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=122.03999999999999s)]
*  on cities like Jerusalem and Tel Aviv since this all began after that massacre on Saturday [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=128.44s)]
*  morning. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=133.32s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=134.32s)]
*  Has it been essentially rocket strikes now since the weekend? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=135.32s)]
*  You don't see a lot of the physical incursions from Hamas fighters? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=139.72s)]
*  There have been a few infiltration attempts since that initial cross of more than what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=145.12s)]
*  we're understanding now at minimum 1,500 fighters because they've found the bodies of 1,500 [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=150.12s)]
*  militants and terrorists that crossed into southern Israel. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=156.56s)]
*  But what we are really starting to understand is that there have been firefights at different [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=160.2s)]
*  locations and they're not always reported. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=164.56s)]
*  We were talking to soldiers when we were in that kibbutz, that small community of Bari [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=166.92s)]
*  yesterday with the army and when we were there we could see, and you can see these ambulances [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=170.72s)]
*  and medical workers still pulling up to this staging point, but when we were with the army [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=177.1s)]
*  there, one soldier said that in that kibbutz where we were at 12 hours ago they were in [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=181.27999999999997s)]
*  a firefight with a Hamas militant and so it gives you a sense that they are still trying [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=186.32s)]
*  these incursions. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=191.16s)]
*  Yesterday three Hamas fighters were killed in the Zakeem area just north of the Gaza [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Strip and we do anticipate they will try to infiltrate again, but the Israelis have secured [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=196.92s)]
*  much of the border. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=202.64s)]
*  Hey, Trey, real quick, as we look at the screen right is another airstrike from Israelis [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=203.64s)]
*  into Gaza City. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=209.72s)]
*  So what you were saying a moment ago is they essentially try to level a building and then [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=211.14s)]
*  they continue to pound it with more rockets so they can get into the tunnels. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=216.88s)]
*  Do they have our really good bunker busters? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=222.6s)]
*  Do we know whether or not they've got access to those? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=225.7s)]
*  They do have bunker buster bombs and they use them, but even those don't work in Gaza [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  sometimes because the tunnels are so deep. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=236.5s)]
*  They put these tunnels so far underground that when they use a bunker buster they have [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=239.56s)]
*  to hit the same place three or four times often to actually target the area they're [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=243.84s)]
*  trying to hit. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=248.23999999999998s)]
*  They've had years and years to build this tunnel system and it is one of the most difficult [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=249.23999999999998s)]
*  parts about their job in Gaza. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=255.45999999999998s)]
*  And remember they have open fields in different areas so you'll often hear about agricultural [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=257.28s)]
*  areas in Gaza that are getting pounded by airstrikes and that's because these are where [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=261.06s)]
*  the rocket launchers are. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=265.08s)]
*  They have systems underground where they can move rockets, feed them into launchers and [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=266.24s)]
*  then fire them in these barrages that land in communities just like this. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=270.91999999999996s)]
*  And it's part of the reason when we've been in Gaza we've stood in craters that are the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=274.84s)]
*  size of houses and still they haven't hit the target underneath. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=278.64s)]
*  Can you explain to our audience the different targets and what I mean by that is what is [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  Hamas striking and what is Israel striking? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=288.52s)]
*  So they're both striking in complex environments. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=295.28s)]
*  When I say complex environments I want to talk about the mixture of military and civilian. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=299.0s)]
*  In Gaza it's an incredibly densely populated area. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=303.8s)]
*  There are more than two million people that live there. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=307.32s)]
*  It's 25 miles long and anywhere from three to seven miles wide. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  The Israelis are striking buildings, they're striking houses, they are striking open fields. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=313.04s)]
*  They have intelligence though about these areas and they're linked to Hamas or Islamic [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=320.08000000000004s)]
*  Jihad. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  The current situation we were told today, this was cleared for publication from the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  Israeli censor because it was sensitive information, but it was cleared that the Israelis are now [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=329.05999999999995s)]
*  targeting people inside Gaza who filmed any of the massacres on Saturday. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=334.88s)]
*  So if they were able to use their intelligence and someone on an iPhone took a video of someone [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=340.26s)]
*  else committing an atrocity or even just filming, they would find that person if they had the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=344.28s)]
*  intelligence on them and hit them with an airstrike or a drone strike or artillery. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=349.76s)]
*  What we are seeing in Gaza today and we should describe the city is just complete destruction [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=354.2s)]
*  of neighborhood blocks and houses and the level of destruction is significant. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=358.24s)]
*  It is the worst Gaza has seen certainly. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QApz-08PSzs&t=363.56s)]
