# 'LITTLE SPARTA': This is Trump's 'big gamble' in the Middle East, host explains
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs)
*  I am not moving on. More importantly, the American people are not moving on. They're not going to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=0.0s)]
*  forget. They have yet to come clean in their four-year debacle, and I'm fed up with it, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=4.24s)]
*  and it angers me they're trying to make money off it. Joining us now, the host of the UUHO and a Fox [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=8.96s)]
*  News contributor, thrilled to have him in the family, Hugh Hewitt. Hugh, what's your reaction [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=13.6s)]
*  to what we are experiencing this week with the Democrats? I got to tell you, I am somewhat [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=18.32s)]
*  surprised that Ro Khanna came on that little clip, because that's the one serious Democrat [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=24.88s)]
*  who's had it right. We should admit that we screwed up and that we participated in a cover-up, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=29.68s)]
*  and we should tell people we participated in a cover-up. I think there are some smart Democrats, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=34.4s)]
*  people like Chris Coons, Amy Klobuchar, Jared Polis. I think you can look at Josh Shapiro. You [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=39.44s)]
*  can go for public intellectuals like Van Jones. There are some smart Democrats. They should get [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=44.72s)]
*  in a room. They ought to come out together and do a mea culpa. The 25th Amendment failed. We failed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=49.44s)]
*  you in telling you how incapacitated the president was, and we are sorry. And now we're going to move [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=55.28s)]
*  forward by doing a couple of important things. And I think, Brian, the most important thing they [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=60.64s)]
*  have to do is have a Sister Soldier moment with somebody that everybody in America is coming around [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=65.28s)]
*  to hate, teachers unions. And they ought to say to the—we're breaking with the teachers unions. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=70.72s)]
*  We're going to be for your kids. We're going to be for getting back the laws to year and a half [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=75.92s)]
*  that we locked them out of school. We made a mistake there as well. We're going to push them [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=80.0s)]
*  out of the party, and we're going to move not to the center—that's asking too much—but we're [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=84.16s)]
*  going to go back to being liberals, not leftists. And I really hope it works, Brian, because if it [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=88.4s)]
*  doesn't, we're going to be stuck with an AOC-led Democratic Party in 2028 that will lead to a [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  disaster for the Democratic Party. And the country's actually benefited by two parties at work. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=100.88s)]
*  Exactly. But here's—they have to have one party that's for the country. And I cannot get out of my [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=105.84s)]
*  head the Russia hoax, and I cannot get out of my head the laptop that they told us wasn't real, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=110.48s)]
*  and how dare we play into the Russian disinformation. And now they want us to [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=115.2s)]
*  believe that they were duped along with us. But I want to pivot, if I can, to the Middle East trip. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=119.28s)]
*  To me, it's the most impactful Middle East trip, foreign trip, that I've seen since I joined Fox [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=124.88s)]
*  25-plus years ago. I thought the president was brilliant and the accomplishments were substantial. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=130.88s)]
*  You, your take. It's a Nixon to China trip with an asterisk. The asterisk is whether or not the big [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=136.64s)]
*  gamble on Syria pays off. I was on Special Report on Friday night, and I told Brett, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=144.64s)]
*  my only concern is, did we take the sanctions off the Syria ruler too soon? It used to be named Al [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  Jelani. I haven't checked this week what his new name is, but he used to be Al Jelani. He was Al [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=158.0s)]
*  Qaeda. Now, maybe he has turned to leaf. Maybe he's working with Erdogan. The president met with him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=162.08s)]
*  President goes—he's only—he's strong enough. Donald Trump is strong enough to deal with a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=167.44s)]
*  terrorist leader-turned-Damascus leader. And Syria is a puzzle that's been broken into many pieces, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=171.68s)]
*  and it's never coming back into one piece. So he's going to get a piece of it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=177.68s)]
*  So that's the big gamble. Other than that, though, it's an A-plus, especially the UAE deal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=181.12s)]
*  1.4 trillion, you mentioned. That's not phantom. When the UAE says they're going to do something, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=186.88s)]
*  they're going to do something. People forget Biden blew up our relationship with the UAE at [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=193.04s)]
*  the beginning of the Biden term, or Jake Sullivan or Tony Blinken did. So putting that back together [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=197.51999999999998s)]
*  again. That's little Sparta. They've gone to war with us in Afghanistan and Iraq. They have always [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=202.64s)]
*  been, along with Israel, our greatest allies in the region. And Israel is a nuclear power. UAE is [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=207.76s)]
*  not. And I think they're helping facilitate the MBS reconciliation. I'm very pleased with the trip. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=212.88s)]
*  Just put down one asterisk on Syria, and let's pray it works out. The president [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=219.84s)]
*  says it will, and I hope he's right. All right. Just a couple of reactions from Democrats. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=224.88s)]
*  One, it's amazing what can be accomplished when the president isn't brain dead. That, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=230.16s)]
*  according to a senior congressional Democrat. Another, a blank in brain dead, by the way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=236.0s)]
*  I'm the first person to say I do not agree with President Trump's policies, especially some foreign. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=239.84s)]
*  But when it comes to showing up and showing strength and power, I think his team is doing [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=244.0s)]
*  a really good job. I'm heartened by that because he's overseas trying to do things for the country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=248.24s)]
*  And I think it was noticed. Just final thought, you? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=254.0s)]
*  That it matches his three great speeches from the first Trump term. One was in Riyadh, one was in [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=258.48s)]
*  Poland, one was in Normandy. This set the bar for Trump 2.0. Very high. Kudos to him and to his entire team. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=263.28s)]
*  Yeah. And now we're going to focus on Iran and the Iran deal next. I hope we get that right. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=270.79999999999995s)]
*  You, you and I'll have you back. So glad you're on Fox now full time. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=274.79999999999995s)]
*  And we're paying your dental and all your health insurance. Thank you. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  You cannot get it anywhere else. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDB_uU2dvGs&t=293.28s)]
