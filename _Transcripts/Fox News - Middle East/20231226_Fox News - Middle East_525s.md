*  condition at this time but do expect to learn more in the hours ahead. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=42.959999999999994s)]
*  The president ordered the strikes after US forces came under attack by a drone. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  According to national security sources the Iranian backed militia Qatayb Hezbollah and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=51.92s)]
*  other affiliated groups under the umbrella of Iranian backed militants claim credit for [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=56.36000000000001s)]
*  the attack. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=60.56s)]
*  President Biden was briefed by his national security team yesterday at Camp David on Christmas [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=61.92s)]
*  Day. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=66.80000000000001s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin put out a statement that reads in part. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=67.80000000000001s)]
*  Let me be clear the president and I will not hesitate to take necessary action to defend [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=70.68s)]
*  the United States our troops and our interests. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=75.48s)]
*  There is no higher priority while we do not seek to escalate conflict in the region. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=78.02s)]
*  We are committed and fully prepared to take further necessary measures to protect our [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=82.61999999999999s)]
*  people and our facilities. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=86.84s)]
*  The White House putting out a statement the president places no higher priority than the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=88.89999999999999s)]
*  protection of American personnel serving in harm's way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=92.53999999999999s)]
*  The United States will act at a time and in a manner of our choosing should these attacks [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=96.66s)]
*  continue. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=103.08s)]
*  This adds just to a growing list as you mentioned on US forces since October 17th days after [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=104.62s)]
*  Hamas targeted Israel and the United States Armed Forces stood with Israel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=109.88000000000001s)]
*  Some of the attacks more dangerous than others like this one yesterday critically injuring [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=114.26s)]
*  a service member. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=118.28s)]
*  Two other service members Carly sustained injuries as well. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=119.62s)]
*  Though according to the official statement their conditions are not as severe. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=122.94s)]
*  We'll continue to watch it back to you. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=127.26s)]
*  All right David Spenton live for us in Washington. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=128.66s)]
*  David thank you. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=130.34s)]
*  Let's bring in Robert Charles who served as Assistant Secretary of State for former [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=131.66s)]
*  President George W. Bush. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=135.44s)]
*  Robert good morning to you. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=137.78s)]
*  What is your assessment this morning of our response to this attack that left three service [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=139.34s)]
*  members injured including one in critical condition? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=143.82s)]
*  Yeah I mean it's definitely a step up Carly from where we've been. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=147.34s)]
*  Iran is becoming more and more risky in what they're doing both in Iraq and from Syria [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=152.5s)]
*  and from the Houthi rebels that they support in Yemen hitting not just international shipping [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=157.44s)]
*  but also hitting American sites. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=162.6s)]
*  But the bottom line here is that it's a proportionate response. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=164.66s)]
*  It's clear we've been consistent and in many ways this is something that this is the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=167.76s)]
*  right this is the right level of response. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=172.62s)]
*  It directly hits the party that in turn hit us and I think one of the things that we have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=174.6s)]
*  to be thinking about is that this gets closer and closer to a direct conflict with Iran. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=179.12s)]
*  These are proxy these are proxy parties the Hezbollah subunit the Houthi rebels and even [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=184.52s)]
*  those in Syria never mind their support Iran's support for Hamas and Islamic Jihad and others [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=191.66000000000003s)]
*  in out of Gaza. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=197.84s)]
*  So I think at the end of the day we just have to be aware all of us that we're creeping [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=199.78s)]
*  toward a more direct conflict with Iran and that would change everything that would take [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=204.10000000000002s)]
*  us back to a period very similar to the 1980s when Reagan had to do some very decisive things [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=207.94s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=213.67999999999998s)]
*  So if you think this is a proportionate response do you think that these strikes against U.S. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  forces in Iraq and Syria will decrease as a result of what we just did? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=218.64s)]
*  Well the goal always goal is Carly is to is to create deterrence so that they understand [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=224.6s)]
*  that they that there will be a rise in the cost to them and we we obviously Israel is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=230.14s)]
*  part of making delivering that message and we are part of delivering that message and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=235.23999999999998s)]
*  the IRGC lost a senior leader in Syria last week and that is that was from Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=241.16s)]
*  But the idea is for Iran to stand down stand back and back off from their support of these [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  groups like Hezbollah because the next step up honestly is a step that is similar to what [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Reagan did in the 1980s that was in October of 87. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=258.47999999999996s)]
*  He initiated an operation called Nimble Archer and again in April of 88 and we directly hit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=263.09999999999997s)]
*  Iranian naval assets and actually took out about half of the Iranian Navy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=270.47999999999996s)]
*  So I think Iran just needs to be careful because you keep stepping up and what's going to [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=275.4s)]
*  happen is the proportionate responses in order to create deterrence are going to actually [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  increase in their intensity and probably get closer to Iran itself. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=284.91999999999996s)]
*  You know you mentioned this IRGC leader that was just killed. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=290.56s)]
*  I wanted to ask you about that. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=293.56s)]
*  According to Iran state media Israel conducted the airstrike in Syria that took this guy [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=295.08s)]
*  down. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=299.0s)]
*  His name is Said Razi Musavi. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=300.0s)]
*  He's responsible for coordinating the military alliance between Syria and Iran and apparently [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=302.56s)]
*  was a friend of Qasem Soleimani who died in a drone strike in 2020 at the hands of the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=308.2s)]
*  United States. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=314.04s)]
*  Iran's president and the IRGC now say that Israel will pay the price for killing this [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=315.92s)]
*  guy. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=319.72s)]
*  So does that mean that Israel's war has just widened or escalated in any significant way [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=320.72s)]
*  that we should know about? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=325.48s)]
*  I think escalation is always a concern Carly and we should be thinking about that hour [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=328.0s)]
*  by hour not just day by day and week by week. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=332.08s)]
*  Iran is intent on pushing the envelope here but I think it's a good thing that the Biden [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  administration in concert with Israel is responding and that Israel in turn responded took a page [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=341.32s)]
*  actually from the Trump book and Soleimani and took out somebody that was obviously a [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=347.32s)]
*  proactive element in creating instability across the region. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=353.56s)]
*  We've got instability in Syria, we've got it in Iraq, we've got it in the Red Sea, we've [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  got it in the obviously in Gaza, we've got it at the perimeters of all of those parts [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=361.2s)]
*  of the world. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=367.8s)]
*  We even have an Iranian missile that apparently hit a commercial vessel in the Indian Ocean. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=368.8s)]
*  So there is a clear propensity for escalation but the idea of responding proportionally [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=374.32s)]
*  is that you make it clear that the costs are going to be direct, they're going to be significant [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=380.44s)]
*  and that if you keep pushing the envelope the pushback will get stronger and harder [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=386.47999999999996s)]
*  and ultimately that's what we know in the history of mankind. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=390.55999999999995s)]
*  That's how you deter wider wars. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=394.2s)]
*  But the answer to your question is yes, it takes us another step up toward a more direct [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=397.35999999999996s)]
*  conflict with Iran and Iran just needs to back off and stop the aggression. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=401.44s)]
*  So you do mention that there is uncertainty in the Red Sea, a major focal point of conflict [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=406.46s)]
*  right now where Houthi forces are attacking these commercial ships. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=414.5s)]
*  15 ships have so far been attacked by Houthi forces with the help of Iran and the Wall [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=418.46s)]
*  Street Journal puts it this way, the Houthi attacks have created a new front in the battle [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=424.06s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas and are just the latest test of Washington's ability to support [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=428.34s)]
*  its closest Middle East ally while trying to contain the conflict from spilling over [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=434.46s)]
*  into a regional war. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=438.82s)]
*  Obviously there is debate within the Biden administration over how to handle these Houthi [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=440.96s)]
*  strikes on ships in the Red Sea because the Biden administration feels that the Houthis [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=446.2s)]
*  are a wild card. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=451.5s)]
*  How do you think that we should respond? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=453.28s)]
*  I think it's not that complicated. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=456.91999999999996s)]
*  You have 12 percent of all the international commerce going through the Red Sea and these [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=459.96s)]
*  Houthi rebels are not just supported by Iran, they're directly acting on Iran's direction. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=465.72s)]
*  They have their armaments come from Iran. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=471.72s)]
*  So what we need to do is put together a coalition force led by the United States, very similar [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ScRa4eE1qc&t=475.16s)]
