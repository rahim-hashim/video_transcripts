# Trump is the ‘LEAST LIKELY’ president to do this, says Sen. Ron Johnson
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc)
*  President Trump continued his marathon briefing today, cracking some jokes and dropping his own bomb. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=0.0s)]
*  By the way, so many questions. Should we keep this going, Pam? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=6.0s)]
*  Yes! Yes! Yes! [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=9.0s)]
*  This is the opposite of Biden. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=13.0s)]
*  Biden would take a half a question and he'd leave without answering it. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=15.0s)]
*  On Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=19.0s)]
*  You tell me when it gets boring. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=21.0s)]
*  If the intelligence reports conclude that Iran can enrich uranium to a level that concerns you, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=23.0s)]
*  would you consider bombing the country again? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=32.0s)]
*  Sure. Without question, absolutely. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=34.0s)]
*  No hesitation. And despite the fact that he's not backing down on Iran, the president said they're still willing to talk. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=36.0s)]
*  Mr. President, are you concerned that the Iranians may have some enriched uranium at Pickaxe Mountain? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=44.0s)]
*  The last thing they're thinking about right now is enriched uranium. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=52.0s)]
*  They're not thinking about it. What they want to do is they want to get back to life. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=56.0s)]
*  And they do want to meet me. And we'll do that quickly. We're going to do it quickly. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=59.0s)]
*  Here to weigh in is Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=65.0s)]
*  Senator, in a 53 to 47 vote, the Senate just rejected a Democratic-led bid to block Trump from using further military force against Iran [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=68.0s)]
*  just hours after the president said he would consider more bombing. What's your take on all this? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=77.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, I completely agree with President Trump that we can never allow the ayatollahs in Iran to become a nuclear power. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=84.0s)]
*  So I appreciate his bold decision. Not an easy decision, not risk-free, but it definitely set back Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=91.0s)]
*  It's unfortunate the ayatollahs, they simply refuse to peacefully coexist, which is such a tragedy for the Iranian people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=98.0s)]
*  Because I do not believe they like living under the thumb of such a brutal regime. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=105.0s)]
*  And it would be nice if they would cooperate, if they would negotiate and allow unfettered inspections [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=110.0s)]
*  so that we could assure ourselves that they will never become a nuclear power. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=118.0s)]
*  With Uranians, you can't trust them. You just have to verify, verify, verify, and you're going to have to keep them in check. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=122.0s)]
*  Obviously, there are a lot of people in your party and across the conservative spectrum who are very, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=129.0s)]
*  and many of whom are Trump supporters, who are very eager not to get into another protracted foreign war. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=136.0s)]
*  How confident are you that President Trump can avoid that? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=144.0s)]
*  I think President Trump is the president in my lifetime, the least likely to get us into a long-term foreign entanglement. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=149.0s)]
*  I'll never forget when Iran knocked down one of our drones. Everybody was beating the drums of war, saying you have to retaliate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=157.0s)]
*  The 12th hour, President Trump asked the relevant questions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=165.0s)]
*  How much did that drone cost? A couple million bucks. How many people are going to get killed in the retaliation? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=168.0s)]
*  A few hundred. He said, you know, it's just not worth it. And he backed down. I thought that took courage. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=173.0s)]
*  That was the right decision to make. So again, he does not, he wants peace. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=178.0s)]
*  I mean, isn't it great to have a president who is focusing on peace? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=181.0s)]
*  Sometimes he maybe overstates how easy it is to achieve peace. It's not. You've got to take some tough decisions. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=185.0s)]
*  He's willing to make those tough decisions, but it's that strength that he's showing that is probably our best assurance for peace. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=192.0s)]
*  Yeah. And of course, if you recall when he made those comments back then and noted that the drone that Iran shot down was unmanned, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=198.0s)]
*  of course, the press pounced on him and ridiculed him, claiming that somehow he didn't realize the drones were unmanned. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=206.0s)]
*  No, the point was he was doing the math in his head. How do you feel? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=215.0s)]
*  How confident are you that the bombings that we saw over the weekend actually accomplished what they were supposed to accomplish? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=219.0s)]
*  Well, we had a secure briefing. I can't really reveal everything. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=227.0s)]
*  But first of all, I am I am comforted by the competence of President Trump's national security team. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=230.0s)]
*  Excellent briefing by Secretary of State, by the general. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=237.0s)]
*  Just a really good briefing. Listen, extensively damaged. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=243.0s)]
*  I don't think they ever thought they could take out all the enriched uranium, but they've they've set back their nuclear program. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=248.0s)]
*  No doubt about it. Now we have to keep tabs on them. We have to verify, verify, verify. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=254.0s)]
*  Again, open ourselves up to negotiation. See if the Atolls will come to their senses. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=259.0s)]
*  I'm hoping, quite honestly, that they do. If they don't, I'm hoping the Iranian people in such a weakened state might rise up and replace them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=264.0s)]
*  Senator Ron Johnson, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V-GSrWzJrQc&t=272.0s)]
