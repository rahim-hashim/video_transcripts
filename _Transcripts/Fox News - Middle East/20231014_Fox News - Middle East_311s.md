# How did Hamas obtain their weaponry?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ)
*  We're back with the Fox News alert. Israel's ground invasion of Gaza is imminent this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=0.0s)]
*  One of the biggest questions on everyone's mind is how the terrorists were able to acquire [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=4.72s)]
*  their weaponry in such large scale. So let's go off the wall to explore the weaponry and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=9.52s)]
*  muscle behind the horror and terror that we saw last week in southern Israel. And it always [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=15.84s)]
*  comes back in the beginning to Iran. So the Biden administration may for strategic [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=22.0s)]
*  purposes be wanting to downplay the specific involvement of Iran in these attacks, but even [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=27.6s)]
*  they wouldn't deny the extent to which Iran has been front and center. Even though Iran's a Shia [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=32.72s)]
*  country and Hamas is a Sunni terrorist organization, normally they wouldn't work together. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=37.44s)]
*  It's the proximity of the Gaza Strip and Hamas and their willingness to wage that jihad that [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=42.24s)]
*  has Iran interested. So whether it's tunneling through the infrastructure, it's smuggling [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=47.28s)]
*  weapons in otherwise that would look like legitimate means. A lot of times aid. They [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=52.56s)]
*  find ways to get a lot of advanced weaponry in to Hamas. We've mentioned that New York Times [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=58.72s)]
*  report a couple of times this morning talking about how long this has been in the planning [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=63.92s)]
*  well over a year in the coordination, the number of people and countries involved in what we saw [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  take place last weekend. Pete, I'm curious. You talk about how it came in through what seems like [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=72.4s)]
*  legitimate means or from the sea or through tunnels. We're going to talk about missiles and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=78.88s)]
*  overwhelming power in a minute, but a lot of the damage done was with rifles. It was with guns. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=84.16s)]
*  What do we talk about? AK-47s? AK-47s, RPGs. In fact, we also saw M4s. A lot of that weapon [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=92.0s)]
*  came from our own stocks in Afghanistan. So the ability of Iran to import weapons, large and small, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=98.8s)]
*  they've got a sophisticated network and they've been able to do it for a long time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=105.36s)]
*  Then you've got the recycle of materials. See, you think, oh, we're going to send water pipes [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=108.72s)]
*  over to the Palestinians over in Gaza to help with their infrastructure. Well, those water pipes get [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=112.72s)]
*  turned into missile silos. They use the rubble or other previous scrap metals to turn them into [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=117.36s)]
*  weaponry. On that note, one thing that's important is there are so many nations, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=125.2s)]
*  including the United States, that sends humanitarian aid to Palestine. All of that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=128.8s)]
*  is turned into essentially the war effort. I saw a video of bags that would have been used to send [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=134.07999999999998s)]
*  food that are essentially bunker bags for Hamas and they've got the country of Japan emblazoned [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=140.32s)]
*  all over it. Or think about how much metal you might use to upgrade your electrical grid [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=145.6s)]
*  that you could also use to upgrade your tunnels. That's how Hamas is operating in the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=150.16s)]
*  Let's move forward. I asked about essentially small weapon fire. Now let's talk about greater [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=155.84s)]
*  scale. The missiles that we hear so much about, Pete. Yeah, I mean, they've got, it started for [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=160.4s)]
*  many years on smaller Qasem missiles that had a limited range. So you had really southern Israel [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=166.16s)]
*  who had to be aware of Hamas' threat. Now you're hearing alarms out in Tel Aviv and in Jerusalem [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=172.96s)]
*  because they've acquired more and more longer range missiles. It used to be a North problem [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=178.72s)]
*  with Hezbollah. Now it's a Hamas problem. Some of these you see 46 miles, 93 mile radiuses. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=183.20000000000002s)]
*  As we've laid out, Israel's not a big country. And you're also talking about bigger and bigger [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=189.28s)]
*  warheads in that case too. So more and more damage. Now Israel has their own defense system. You've [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=193.36s)]
*  heard about it, the Iron Dome. This is in essence how that system works. I'll start the beginning of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  this, Pete. The enemy fires the rocket from somewhere inside of Gaza or the West Bank. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=204.24s)]
*  By the way, sophisticated firing system? It doesn't have to be, right? So in fact, the initial [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  reports are that Hamas shot off hundreds of dummy rockets to try to engage with the Iron Dome so [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=215.36s)]
*  that their more sophisticated missiles would come later once ammunition had been spent out of Iron [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=220.96s)]
*  Dome. So any type of missile can be identified. A radar system detects that a missile has been [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  fired and at that point the control system begins to calculate. That's right. And these are all [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=230.8s)]
*  mobile systems so you can move the Iron Dome around to protect certain square miles of Israel [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=235.36s)]
*  as well. It's not just a missile hitting a missile. This graphic isn't necessarily accurate. It's [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=239.60000000000002s)]
*  almost more like a buckshot out of a shotgun. So you've essentially got a bullet meeting a [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=244.72s)]
*  shotgun spray? You've got a shotgun. I mean it's a bullet that becomes a shotgun spray. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=249.28s)]
*  It doesn't have to be point-on-point perfect. It's got to be area close enough that it will take out [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=255.28s)]
*  that missile that's in the air. You also have another system called David Sling which is for [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=260.16s)]
*  more sophisticated, longer-range rockets and actually a third system as well that Israel [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=265.36s)]
*  employs to try to protect its people at this point. And by the way speaking of those rockets [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=270.24s)]
*  you can take a look. The rockets from Hamas have improved over time. A lot of those celebrations I [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  think you used to see when these rockets hit in Israel were over the fact that oh my gosh we hit [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=280.64s)]
*  something. 22%, 18%. This is hitting in urban areas and doing serious damage, human damage [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=284.40000000000003s)]
*  in Israel but that's improved as you can see to about 50%. Better technology means more accuracy [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=290.88s)]
*  and they're always trying to get around the defense systems no doubt. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmHM1pLAHgQ&t=297.2s)]
