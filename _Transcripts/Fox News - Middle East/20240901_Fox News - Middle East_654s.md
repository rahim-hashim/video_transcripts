# IDF recovers bodies of six hostages murdered in Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg)
*  We begin this hour with a Fox News alert. The IDF announcing they have found six dead hostages taken by Hamas on October 7th inside of a tunnel in Gaza just days ago. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=0.0s)]
*  Sadly, that includes the reigns of Hirsch Goldberg-Polen, who is the fourth American hostage believed to have been killed by Hamas. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=12.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks joins us live from Hostage Square in Tel Aviv with more. Trey? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=20.0s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. Six of the Israeli hostages that were being held by Hamas were killed by the group. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=27.0s)]
*  According to the IDF, their bodies were recovered this weekend. It's a heartbreaking development for the Israeli people who have waited 331 days for them to come home. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=34.0s)]
*  Three of the hostages were set to be released from Gaza during the first humanitarian exchange once a ceasefire was implemented, I'm told. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=45.0s)]
*  Among them, American citizen Hirsch Goldberg-Polen. His story grabbed the attention of the world. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=52.0s)]
*  The 23-year-old was attending a music festival when the October 7th attack began. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=57.0s)]
*  He hid inside a bomb shelter that Hamas ultimately threw grenades inside of. While he lost his arm, he survived and was dragged into Gaza. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=62.0s)]
*  Still, though, the ordeal, he survived until being executed in recent days. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=70.0s)]
*  President Biden released a statement overnight saying he was devastated and outraged, adding that the bodies were recovered from a tunnel underneath Rafa. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=76.0s)]
*  The news has moved Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant to call on the war cabinet to reverse a decision led by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu last week to keep troops in the Philadelphia corridor between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=84.0s)]
*  This was seen as the last major sticking point, preventing a ceasefire deal. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=97.0s)]
*  The funeral for the six Israeli hostages will be held in the days ahead, but I can tell you it was a gloomy morning here in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=101.0s)]
*  It actually rained in the city for the first time in months, and the entire population of Israel grieving today the loss of their six fellow citizens. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=109.0s)]
*  Guys? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=117.0s)]
*  Trey, thanks for that report. It certainly is a sad day in Israel. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=118.0s)]
*  You mentioned Rafa and the crossing point there as a sticking point on the ceasefire. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=122.0s)]
*  So if I'm correct, the cabinet had said we're keeping Israeli troops there because we can't trust Hamas to control that checkpoint. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=128.0s)]
*  You're saying that may change now in light of this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=135.0s)]
*  How does this event change the ongoing negotiations, especially that crossing point? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=137.0s)]
*  Yes, I want to take you through a little bit about what occurred over the past week. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=143.0s)]
*  I spoke this morning with a senior Israeli official who indicated last week at a cabinet meeting, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=148.0s)]
*  Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu got in a screaming match over what to do next with the Philadelphia corridor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=153.0s)]
*  This is a strip of land about the width of a football field that sits between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=161.0s)]
*  And currently, Israeli forces are deployed throughout this area to prevent smuggling across the border and to secure this area. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=166.0s)]
*  Now, this is largely seen as a sticking point in the negotiations indirectly between Israel and Hamas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=174.0s)]
*  Hamas says if there are Israeli forces there, they're not willing to accept a ceasefire deal. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=180.0s)]
*  So Israel's Defense Minister said, look, we need to get the hostages home and we are willing to do whatever it takes, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=184.0s)]
*  even if that means temporarily removing forces from the area. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=190.0s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he would not go for that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=193.0s)]
*  And the majority of the cabinet actually voted against the Israeli Defense Minister. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=197.0s)]
*  And so today, Galant called again for another vote on this very issue, trying to get the cabinet to see that if there is not a deal to remove Israeli forces from the Philadelphia corridor, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=201.0s)]
*  there won't be a ceasefire deal. And the remaining more than 100 hostages, some of them dead and some of them alive, will remain inside Gaza. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=212.0s)]
*  Real quick, Trey, is a cabinet vote, is that binding? Is that just for public consumption? How does that work? What does a vote mean? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=219.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's how the decisions are made in Israel at the military level at this point in the war. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=228.0s)]
*  Remember, there was a specific war cabinet that actually had members of the previous opposition within it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=234.0s)]
*  That was dissolved, and there was a larger cabinet now that's making most of the decisions about what to do with the war inside Gaza. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=240.0s)]
*  And I'm going to paraphrase here what Minister Galant said to the prime minister last week. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=247.0s)]
*  He said to him, you're able to bring anything you want as prime minister to a vote in this cabinet, including the execution of hostages. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=252.0s)]
*  He wanted to make a point to the Israeli prime minister that if they don't get a ceasefire deal now, this will cost the lives of Israeli hostages. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=260.0s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened, Trey. I'm curious, you're there in Israel. What is the feeling of the Israeli people? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=268.0s)]
*  Because I know that there's a lot of consternation, a lot of debate. There are those who say they want the military to do whatever it takes to get rid of Hamas, to end that problem with Hamas. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=275.0s)]
*  And then there are those that say we need to prioritize these hostages, which include American citizens, Israeli citizens, and others from around the world. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=287.0s)]
*  So the country is very divided on this issue, and it's part of the reason you've seen protests in the streets calling for a ceasefire deal. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=298.0s)]
*  But also there is a portion of this population, especially those who are supportive of the Likud party of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that want the war to continue, whether or not there is a deal to get the hostages out. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=305.0s)]
*  And just as we're speaking here, I got a text message from a senior Hamas official commenting on what President Biden said earlier today, the outrage that he expressed about the killing of these Israeli hostages. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=317.0s)]
*  And I'm just reading through it here as we talk, and I'm not going to read it to you because much of it is propaganda coming from Hamas. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=330.0s)]
*  But he blames President Biden for supporting the Israelis throughout this war. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=336.0s)]
*  And look, Hamas doesn't want to accept any responsibility for killing the hostages. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=340.0s)]
*  They want to blame Israel and the United States. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=344.0s)]
*  But the reality is, according to the IDF, these hostages were actually executed in the recent days as Israeli forces moved in. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=346.0s)]
*  And it gives you a sense of the pressure right now on these negotiations that are still ongoing at the working level in Doha. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=354.0s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure because if there is not a ceasefire agreement, it means the war continues. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=360.0s)]
*  And the hostages, dozens of them that are still alive inside Gaza, their lives are currently at risk. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=366.0s)]
*  Trey, real quick. I know you're just reading through that as you're on TV right now. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=372.0s)]
*  Does Hamas ever deny the accusation that they were murdered or executed? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=376.0s)]
*  Does Hamas ever deflect in that way? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=382.0s)]
*  They do. And in this new book that I wrote, Black Saturday, discussing the October 7th massacre, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=386.0s)]
*  I actually questioned senior Hamas leadership about that morning where we saw the massacre unfolding before our eyes. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=391.0s)]
*  Our cameras captured the aftermath in the Kibbutzim, in Be'erih, in Kafaraza, in Neroz. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=398.0s)]
*  We saw what Hamas did on that morning, yet the organization wants to pretend like it didn't happen. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=403.0s)]
*  They sent us statements and videos claiming that they didn't kill civilians. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=409.0s)]
*  That's simply a lie. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=413.0s)]
*  One last thing, Trey. As it pertains to Hamas, is it a functioning... [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=415.0s)]
*  These negotiations, what do we know about the extent to which Hamas controls and knows where all the hostages are? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=421.0s)]
*  Are we really negotiating with one entity or are there different wings that control different hostages with different incentive structures? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=428.0s)]
*  How much does one person control these negotiations? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=435.0s)]
*  It's a great question. And look, the man in charge of negotiations for Hamas is Yahya Sienwar, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=440.0s)]
*  one of the masterminds behind the October 7th massacre. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=446.0s)]
*  There were three of them, Mohamed Def, who was killed in an airstrike that Israel conducted in southern Gaza earlier this year. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=449.0s)]
*  Ismael Khania, the political leader of Hamas who was killed in Tehran earlier this year. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=455.0s)]
*  The only remaining Hamas official at the very top of the chain to make decisions for the organization about the possibility of a ceasefire is Yahya Sienwar, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=460.0s)]
*  a man who, according to Israeli media reports, is surrounded in the tunnels beneath Gaza with hostages. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=468.0s)]
*  He understands that if he comes above ground by himself, he will be taken out in a targeted strike by the Israelis. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=474.0s)]
*  And it's part of the reason he has surrounded himself with hostages, because he wants to stay alive as long as possible. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=480.0s)]
*  And look, this is someone who previously was held in an Israeli prison. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=486.0s)]
*  He was released as part of a prisoner exchange at a thousand to one exchange. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=490.0s)]
*  And that is part of the reason there is some pressure right now on the Israelis about the exchange rate for hostages to Palestinian prisoners, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=495.0s)]
*  because they do understand that if they release top terror leaders from Israeli prisons, some of them will go back to committing attacks against Israel. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=502.0s)]
*  Trey, the hostage families, the ones that are remaining alive, Pete mentioned probably from our last guest, probably about 50 of them, they suspect. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=511.0s)]
*  Jonathan, what was his name again? [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=522.0s)]
*  The... [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=523.0s)]
*  Konricas. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=524.0s)]
*  Konricas, thank you. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=525.0s)]
*  Jonathan Konricas estimates about 50 of them. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=526.0s)]
*  Where are these families at now? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=528.0s)]
*  I mean, they just saw what happened yesterday. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=530.0s)]
*  Where are they at? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=533.0s)]
*  Do they feel like their political organization and pressure on the government will have any positive outcome? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=534.0s)]
*  What's going to happen with them? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=541.0s)]
*  The majority of the families of Israeli hostages believe that their government has failed them. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=544.0s)]
*  And it's part of the reason they're in the streets calling for a ceasefire, because 331 days into this conflict, there are still more than 100 Israelis both dead and alive inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=550.0s)]
*  And it is devastating for this population. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=562.0s)]
*  Just last week, we went to a funeral for a young 34 year old named Yagev, who was at his home in Nerim, a small community in southern Israel, when he was dragged along with his wife, Ramon, into the Gaza Strip. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=564.0s)]
*  He is a man who loved animals and music, and he was slaughtered. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=577.0s)]
*  He was at home. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=581.0s)]
*  And we went to that funeral. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=583.0s)]
*  We talked to the family from the days after Black Saturday, the days after the October 7th massacre. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=584.0s)]
*  And his mother and his sister spent each and every day pleading with the government to cut a ceasefire deal. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=590.0s)]
*  They spent each and every day calling for Yagev's release. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=596.0s)]
*  And the last time that we saw the two of them, they stood over his grave as they buried this young Israeli. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=599.0s)]
*  And that is what so many families here are worried about, that they will have the same fate. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=605.0s)]
*  They will be attending the funerals of their loved ones. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=610.0s)]
*  And that's why there's so much pressure on this situation, because we talk about the numbers. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=613.0s)]
*  We talk about 331 days into this war, the more than 100 Israelis that are held inside Gaza, both dead and alive. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=616.0s)]
*  But each one of those numbers is a human. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=623.0s)]
*  It's a family member. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=626.0s)]
*  It is someone affected by that massacre, and they were dragged into Gaza against their will. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=627.0s)]
*  And the decisions that are made by this government as we speak will have direct impacts on the Israeli people [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=633.0s)]
*  and the entire world that is watching what happens to this country. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=639.0s)]
*  Well, Trey, great reporting. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=642.0s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=644.0s)]
*  By the way, folks should check out Black Saturday, Trey's book, a definitive account of what occurred, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=645.0s)]
*  and give you a better sense of where we are right now. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=649.0s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=poYr9gms_yg&t=651.0s)]
