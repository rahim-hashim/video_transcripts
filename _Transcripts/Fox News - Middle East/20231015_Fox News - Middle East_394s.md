# Biden admin quietly suspended Iran envoy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI)
*  Part of that you would hope, that conversation, whether or not we're on the brink of World War III [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=0.0s)]
*  or we are trying to put pressure to release hostages, always comes back to Iran. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=4.24s)]
*  And so we need to discuss the role of Iran, who is now warning through the UN, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=8.8s)]
*  sent a message through the UN that if Israel invades Gaza, quote, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister stressed that Iran has its red lines. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=19.68s)]
*  He said that if the Israeli military operation continues, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=23.52s)]
*  and especially if Israel follows through on its promise of a ground offensive in Gaza, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=26.68s)]
*  Iran will have to respond according to sources. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=30.12s)]
*  And then that is why the suspicion is, or that's the suggestion of why [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=35.72s)]
*  we've positioned aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=39.88s)]
*  Interestingly, the Biden administration is saying, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=42.120000000000005s)]
*  don't worry, Iran is not participating in this war. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=45.24s)]
*  I have no idea how they are so certain of that, given everything that we know so far. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=48.44s)]
*  But here's this video. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=52.36s)]
*  In this moment, we don't have anything that shows us that Iran was directly involved in this attack [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=56.6s)]
*  and planning it or in carrying out. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=64.04s)]
*  It's not like the Iranians were ever going to be able to get all six billion or even a billion at [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=65.48s)]
*  a time. The idea would be allocated in very small chunks. So the idea that even if they had started [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=69.88s)]
*  to draw on that fund, that it would be able to fund Hamas is just not true. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=75.88s)]
*  We don't have specific information that ties Iran to this attack. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  We have not seen any evidence, specific evidence, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=83.8s)]
*  that Iran was directly involved with these specific sets of attacks. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=88.44s)]
*  This is astounding to me, these apologists, because it's not the six billion. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=93.08s)]
*  It is the sanctions that they have lifted and have enriched Iran, by the way, to the tune of, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=99.24s)]
*  you know, some say 40, 50 billion dollars. They're selling oil to the Chinese. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=105.32s)]
*  They, every indication is that they're involved. But the Biden administration is so committed [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=110.84s)]
*  to this deal with Iran that was started under the Obama administration that they revived [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=117.48s)]
*  when Biden got into office. And this is really what's playing behind it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=122.92s)]
*  We're going to have a clip right now from, I'd like to just get to John Radcliffe, if we could, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=127.4s)]
*  because he believes that we talked earlier on the couch about intelligence failures. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=131.64000000000001s)]
*  He believes that that relationship with Iran, some of the infiltration of Iran into our own [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=136.92000000000002s)]
*  intelligence may have had something to do with that. Listen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=143.32s)]
*  Well, clearly there was an intelligence failure, you know, both by Israel and by the United States. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=148.2s)]
*  Both governments have admitted, you know, an element of surprise to all of that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=154.6s)]
*  You know, I think that, you know, one of the things that may contribute to that is the fact that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=161.16s)]
*  as you've talked about, Larry, you know, the United States and Israel, for the first time, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  there's been daylight between our countries because of the approach that this administration [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=170.12s)]
*  has taken in courting Iran, in begging Iran, pleading with Iran, enriching Iran. And, you know, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  that has filtered down into the relationship between our intelligence communities. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  And, you know, I hope that that hasn't contributed to, you know, a lack of sharing important [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  intelligence. But it's very clearly something that is that is in play. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=191.8s)]
*  You know, it's also Hamas is not hiding from the connection to Iran and neither is Iran. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=197.88000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they held a meeting yesterday in Qatar, the head of Hamas, along with a top official from [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=203.72s)]
*  Iran publicly embracing each other. So at this point, Iran is owning that aspect of it. They're [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=209.16000000000003s)]
*  threatening an escalation because they've seen appeasement from the United States of America. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=216.2s)]
*  They, for whatever reason, the soft pro-Iranian approach has been the default of this administration. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  In contrast, that with bombs being dropped on the head of Qasem Soleimani, which everyone else said [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=228.11999999999998s)]
*  was a reckless move by Donald Trump. But it sent a very strong signal to Iran of where we stood. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=233.07999999999998s)]
*  And now we've got aircraft carrier groups in the Mediterranean, which we would threaten to use, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=238.76s)]
*  but we really don't want to, which makes it the worst of all scenarios because Iran has a lot of [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=244.12s)]
*  leverage. Well, this cannot, I think, be separated from what is a major story receiving very little [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=248.84s)]
*  coverage. And that is the fact that three Iranian diplomats, I believe it was, who were working for [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=254.68s)]
*  a Biden administration. Yes. What was he? The ambassador? They were Iranian. He's an American [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=261.4s)]
*  envoy to Iran. His name's Rob Malley. Yes. Okay. He has been expelled from the Biden [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=271.4s)]
*  administration. This happened not long ago. Only after it was uncovered, correct? Only after it [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=276.2s)]
*  was uncovered. He was expelled from the Biden administration, had his security clearances revoked, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=280.2s)]
*  and these three Iranians have been essentially, basically now accused of espionage. So inside the [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=285.79999999999995s)]
*  Biden administration, there is an espionage scandal connected to Iran, and it's getting no coverage. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=293.64s)]
*  No coverage. Ted Cruz was on Life, Liberty, and Levin, and he laid out some of the details. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=301.64s)]
*  Rob Malley's been fired. His security clearance has been revoked. We don't know why, but he did [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=310.52s)]
*  something so egregious that even this White House revoked his security clearance. What we do know [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=315.08s)]
*  is that Rob Malley brought in three senior advisors, all of whom were Iranian operatives. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=321.88s)]
*  They were spies. They were recruited by the Iranian government. Those three Iranian operatives [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=329.24s)]
*  were helping lead the Biden administration's policy on Iran, and one of them remains a chief of staff [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=335.24s)]
*  in a senior position in the Department of Defense, presumably with their security clearances still in [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=341.88s)]
*  place. It is shocking, and you know what? Senate Foreign Relations Committee hasn't held a single [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=347.64s)]
*  hearing on Iranian spies directing our Iranian policy while we're flooding billions of dollars [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=353.64s)]
*  that is funding Hamas while they're murdering over 1,200 Israelis. It is disgraceful, and any [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=359.56s)]
*  Democrat who wants to stop it needs to stand up and say, cut off the money and get rid of the Iranian [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=366.68s)]
*  spies. Amazing. Incredible story. Imagine Iran hiring Americans to direct their policy toward America. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=371.88s)]
*  You know what I mean? It's crazy that we would allow such a thing. But you can see why the Biden [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=380.28s)]
*  administration now is saying, well, we don't know if Iran's involved because the Biden administration [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=384.03999999999996s)]
*  has a lot of culpability in what is happening right now. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vzPZEpaHhI&t=390.68s)]
