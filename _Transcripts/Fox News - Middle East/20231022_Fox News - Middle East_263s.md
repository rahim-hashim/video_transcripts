# IDF spokesperson: Hamas will fight and try to inflect heavy casualties
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU)
*  As Israel prepares for the next phase of the war, joining us right now to expand on this [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=0.0s)]
*  and so much more, the international spokesperson for the Israeli Defense Forces, or IDF, Lieutenant [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=4.16s)]
*  Colonel Jonathan Konrakis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=9.4s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, great to hear from you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=11.4s)]
*  Jonathan, can you give me an update on the air campaign and what the objective is and [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  how much that has to do with when the ground action starts? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=19.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=24.52s)]
*  A pleasure, as always. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=25.52s)]
*  So we have, as your reporter reported, two active fronts, the main front in the south [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=26.92s)]
*  and a secondary front in the north. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  In the north, Hezbollah is really trying to escalate the situation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=36.02s)]
*  We have had a total of seven casualties so far, civilian and military, and dozens of [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  anti-tank missiles have been fired by Hezbollah at Israel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  At this stage, we are responding to the aggressions only, and we haven't decided to escalate the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=51.16s)]
*  situation further. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=57.8s)]
*  In the south, our aerial campaign continues. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=59.28s)]
*  We are preparing for the next stage of operations. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=61.86s)]
*  We are targeting Hamas leaders, their infrastructure, the logistic infrastructure, and everything [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  related to Hamas combat capabilities. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=69.6s)]
*  The aim here is to have a weakened, tired, and dislocated Hamas in preparation for our [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=72.72s)]
*  next stage of military operations. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=79.64s)]
*  Colonel, do you believe that Hamas is trying to run and get out, maybe mix in with civilians, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=82.19999999999999s)]
*  and go through the Ra'afah crossing, or do you think they want to stay and fight you [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=89.91999999999999s)]
*  guys? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=93.16s)]
*  In essence, Hamas are cowards. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  Their whole strategy is built upon hiding behind civilians or under civilians, and we've [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=99.0s)]
*  seen it in the past that when the going gets tough, they have a tendency to put down weapons [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=105.28s)]
*  and try to flee as a last resort. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=110.32s)]
*  However, our working assumption is that Hamas has prepared the battlefield, that there are [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=113.32s)]
*  various dimensions of warfare ready for us, specifically tunnels, and that Hamas, at least [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  in the first and the intermediate stages, will fight and will try to inflict heavy casualties [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=126.34s)]
*  on the IDF. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=131.8s)]
*  That is our working assumption. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=132.8s)]
*  That is how we are preparing for operations, and that is how we are going to address the [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=134.4s)]
*  situation in terms of the assets that we will be bringing to the fore once the next stage [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  of operation commences. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=145.36s)]
*  Islamic Jihad on your target list, too? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=148.68s)]
*  Definitely. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=152.60000000000002s)]
*  Every terror organization in Gaza, first and foremost Hamas, but Islamic Jihad, the smaller [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=154.08s)]
*  but more radical Iranian proxy that exists in the Gaza Strip, definitely on our list. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=159.64s)]
*  Just as we cannot accept a situation where Hamas sees the light of day at the end of [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=166.12s)]
*  this war, we definitely cannot accept Islamic Jihad either. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=170.72s)]
*  Both of them share the same fate. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=174.92s)]
*  Last week, did this show, two hours, and we were told the reason why the ground operation [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=178.68s)]
*  didn't start was because of weather. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=184.34s)]
*  Now it's a week later it hasn't started, without giving away intelligence that would compromise [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  your operation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=191.32s)]
*  Can you tell me why it's been two weeks? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=192.62s)]
*  When we maneuver or when we do a decisive military action, there's a set of variables [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=198.48s)]
*  that influence the decision and timing. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  You have to take into consideration, as you said before, weather and physical conditions, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  the state of your enemy, the readiness of your own troops, and then there's political [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=211.48s)]
*  and diplomatic issues that need to be harmonized. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=216.04s)]
*  When the conditions are right, we will take the initiative and we will commence operations [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  when the conditions suit us. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=224.92s)]
*  The important thing here is not really when and where it will commence. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=227.35999999999999s)]
*  The important thing here is the aim. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=231.83999999999997s)]
*  We will dismantle Hamas from its military capabilities, and we will create a totally [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=233.72s)]
*  different security environment for the southern part of Israel and actually for the entire [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=239.48s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=243.76s)]
*  Colonel, always great to talk to you. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=246.76s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=248.2s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nuh_QVfgPU&t=250.23999999999998s)]
