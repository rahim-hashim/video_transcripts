*  The Israeli military says 199 innocent people are being held hostage in Gaza. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=14.38s)]
*  You're watching Fox of Friends First. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=19.6s)]
*  Here on a Monday morning, I'm Todd Pyrone. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=20.98s)]
*  And I'm Carly Schimke. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=22.62s)]
*  You were looking live at the Ra'aqa crossing between Gaza and Egypt where mediators are [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=23.62s)]
*  trying to reach a deal for a humanitarian ceasefire to bring in aid. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=29.38s)]
*  But that crossing remains closed and hundreds of people are crowded at the gate at this [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=34.1s)]
*  very moment. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=38.74s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live on the ground in southern Israel with the very latest. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=40.06s)]
*  Trey, good morning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=43.54s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=44.54s)]
*  Right now we are in the town of Sturot that sits just right next to the Gaza border. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  Only about 10% of the population here is left. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  Many have evacuated. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=55.42s)]
*  Some were killed during that initial assault on southern Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=56.58s)]
*  But I do want to show you behind me here we found yet another car that was shot by Hamas [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=59.5s)]
*  militants when they entered last weekend. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=65.02s)]
*  This is a car that belonged to an Arab Israeli taxi driver. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=67.67999999999999s)]
*  You can see the bullet holes in the side and the bloodstained seats. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=71.82s)]
*  It is just a reminder that the militants that entered Gaza took no mercy on the people here. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=75.3s)]
*  It did not matter if they spoke their language. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=82.62s)]
*  It did not matter if they had a similar background. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=84.86s)]
*  They slaughtered everyone in sight. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=87.5s)]
*  Now guys, some of the people were taken back into Gaza from this town. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=90.3s)]
*  When the militants entered Sturot, we do have new GoPro video that was recovered that shows [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=94.14s)]
*  Hamas fighters on the backs of motorcycles. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=100.18s)]
*  As they were entering these areas and taking hostages, the new number we have today from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=103.6s)]
*  the Israeli military indicates at least 199 people are being held hostage inside the Gaza [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=107.74s)]
*  Strip at this moment. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=114.2s)]
*  Part of those negotiations ongoing at this hour to see not only if Americans and other [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=116.16s)]
*  foreigners that are inside Gaza can be let out, but also if any sort of hostage deal [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  can be made behind the scenes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=124.88s)]
*  That's part of the reason we've seen the back and forth, the Israeli military staging here [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=126.84s)]
*  along the Israel-Gaza border, but not yet entering the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=130.56s)]
*  As for the Rafa crossing in the southern part of Gaza, there's been a lot of back and forth [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=134.54s)]
*  this morning. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=138.2s)]
*  The Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had his office put out a statement saying [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=139.2s)]
*  there is no ceasefire and no deal to allow aid into Gaza or foreigners out. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=142.66s)]
*  We have seen some live stream video indicating at least four oil tankers belonging to the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=147.85999999999999s)]
*  United Nations appear to be making their way toward the border. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=152.85999999999999s)]
*  I do want to shift our attention north to the border with Lebanon, where overnight the [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=156.3s)]
*  Israelis struck a number of Hezbollah targets there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=160.62s)]
*  That was after five separate anti-tank guided missiles were fired into northern Israel yesterday. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=163.42s)]
*  That border is certainly heating up with more rocket fire and interceptions overhead. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=168.7s)]
*  And this morning, Israeli authorities evacuating 28 communities along the border, fearing an [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=172.72s)]
*  escalation with the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=177.98s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=180.22s)]
*  Hey, Trey, what's the latest on Egypt allowing Palestinian refugees in through, I guess it [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=181.5s)]
*  would be the Rafa crossing? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  Is Egypt still saying that's not going to happen? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=187.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, the Egyptians so far have not been open to this idea, nor have the Israelis. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=191.38s)]
*  And we should note from a Palestinian perspective, the leadership inside Gaza, Hamas and Islamic [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=196.62s)]
*  Jihad, they say they're not open to this idea at all. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=202.5s)]
*  And it's not surprising. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=205.58s)]
*  In the past, they've used human shields and fought from within civilian areas in an effort [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=206.58s)]
*  to try to win as much publicity as they can in these types of conflicts. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  But it's also important to note that Palestinians see this as Palestinian land, and this is [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=216.74s)]
*  an area they don't want to be removed from, despite the fact that it's currently being [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=220.78s)]
*  ruled by Hamas. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=224.42000000000002s)]
*  But that doesn't appear to be the objective of the Israelis either. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=225.42s)]
*  Yesterday, the government releasing a four point plan indicating what their objectives [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=228.22s)]
*  are in all of this. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=232.17999999999998s)]
*  And there was no place in that plan that indicated they'll try to remove all Palestinians from [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=233.45999999999998s)]
*  Gaza and then occupy that territory. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  It is really focused on degrading and then destroying all Hamas government and military [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=240.66s)]
*  capabilities in the Strip. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=245.94s)]
*  Trey Yanks live first this morning. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=247.82s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=248.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iFL8rjUclI&t=249.82s)]
