# Michael Waltz: This is the tip of the iceberg
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos)
*  With that, let us bring in Florida Congressman and U.S. Army veteran Michael Waltz. Congressman, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=0.0s)]
*  great to have you as always. I want to start off discussing a gentleman named Robert Malley. He's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=4.8s)]
*  Joe Biden's former special envoy to Iran. He's accused of mishandling classified information [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=10.16s)]
*  earlier this year and is now being accused of compromising that classified info. Malley has [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=15.76s)]
*  spoken on Hamas in the past. Listen. There's so much misinformation about them. I mean, I speak [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=21.6s)]
*  to them. My colleagues speak to them. Now, we may disagree with them, but they have their own [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=29.36s)]
*  rationality. That's the one thing to understand. None of them are crazies. None of them are crazies. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=34.0s)]
*  Congressman, how responsible is Robert Malley for our Iranian appeasement strategy? Because that's [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=41.04s)]
*  what it is. And does the attack on Israel happen without Robert Malley's appeasement strategy on [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=46.96s)]
*  Iran? Well, Robert Malley was the lead negotiator not just for Biden, but also for Obama for the [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=53.44s)]
*  original Iran deal that then opened up billions in cash. But back then, the average cost of a [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=63.04s)]
*  hostage was four to 500 million. Now it's up to 1.2 billion. So he was absolutely responsible for [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  this approach. He is an Iranian regime sympathizer. But what is so disturbing, guys, is that he had a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=78.08s)]
*  whole network of people throughout the U.S. government. And I believe we only have seen the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=85.52s)]
*  tip of the iceberg. We know that one of his network is over in the Pentagon's special operations [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=91.52s)]
*  directorate for policy as the chief of staff and still has access to classified systems. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=99.2s)]
*  We want to know in Congress why. How did she get it in the first place and what's being done about it? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=105.12s)]
*  Congressman, right now there's this huge buildup of Palestinians at the Rafa crossing. So right [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=111.28s)]
*  now what we're looking at is people still in the Gaza Strip. If the gates are opened, then they [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=117.44s)]
*  would be in Egypt, which is their ultimate destination. They want to get out of this area. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=123.68s)]
*  But so far the gates remain closed. Why? What's going on here and what's going to happen? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, this is a back and forth negotiation with Israel, with Egypt, with Hamas, somewhat with the [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=136.08s)]
*  United States that keeps changing by the day. But there's really two gates. There's one facing the [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=143.36s)]
*  interior with Hamas, and then there's one facing Egypt. And these people are just kind of stuck. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=149.12s)]
*  Hamas is telling them to go back and turn around until aid trucks are received. And then Egypt and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=156.72s)]
*  Israel aren't letting anything in. Once it's resolved, my position is the countries that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=164.72s)]
*  have enabled Hamas have financed them, have allowed them to exist, which are mainly Turkey, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=171.04s)]
*  Qatar, and Iran. They should be the one to take these refugees. We can't lose sight of the fact [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=177.44s)]
*  that this crisis was started by Hamas and 100% backed by Iran. And so for those who enable Hamas, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=183.11999999999998s)]
*  they should be the ones taking the refugees and taking care of these people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=190.64s)]
*  On the refugee topic, Republican lawmakers now introducing a bill to block Palestinian refugees [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  from entering the U.S. Congressman Tom Tiffany saying, quote, we can't let President Biden abuse [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=202.55999999999997s)]
*  our parole and visa rules to bring unvetted Palestinians into American communities the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=207.67999999999998s)]
*  way he did with thousands of unvetted Afghans. Do you support this bill, Congressman? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=212.39999999999998s)]
*  I do. This burden can't be on the United States. And again, you have so many in the U.N., [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=217.44s)]
*  throughout the U.N. apparatus that are constantly denouncing Israel and are pro-Palestinian. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=227.44s)]
*  You have those folks. You have wealthy Gulf states. You have Turkey that has [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=234.88s)]
*  been unabashedly supporting Hamas, then fine. You guys take on this issue. You guys have the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=240.8s)]
*  resources to open up the camps and to pay for it. Then those nations need to step up and put their [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=248.4s)]
*  money where their mouth is. Yeah. One of the stunning things about this Rafa image that we've [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=257.04s)]
*  been showing is that it could be mistaken for our own southern border, except if it happened here, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=261.04s)]
*  those gates would be opened and we would be letting those people in. So I think that there [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=266.88s)]
*  is also a cautionary tale about what could happen to the United States and all of this as well. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=271.12s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. We appreciate it. Okay. Thank you, sir. Absolutely. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6cgnTKxktos&t=275.44s)]
