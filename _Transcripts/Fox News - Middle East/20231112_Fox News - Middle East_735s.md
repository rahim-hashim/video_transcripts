# Israeli official tells Levin Israel's mission in war: 'We are going to finish off Hamas'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw)
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and this is Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=0.0s)]
*  We have a special guest, former ambassador to the United States from Israel, Ron Dermer. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=3.94s)]
*  He's also the Israeli strategic affairs minister and war cabinet member, a very close confidant [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=8.98s)]
*  to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=14.9s)]
*  Welcome Mr. Ambassador. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=17.26s)]
*  Great to be with you, Mark. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=18.98s)]
*  It seems to me here in the United States, the better the IDF is doing, the more Israel [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=20.14s)]
*  and the IDF are under criticism from the American media, the better the IDF is doing, the more [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=26.5s)]
*  people around the world are rooting against Israel, and the better the IDF are doing, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=32.78s)]
*  the more, well I don't want to drag you into politics in America, let me just say the more [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=39.06s)]
*  hostility there seems to be against Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=44.3s)]
*  Now I don't want to leave the impression that the American people feel this way, absolutely [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=46.66s)]
*  not. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=50.14s)]
*  The American people I deal with want you to kick butt and kick it as hard as you can and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=51.34s)]
*  as fast as you can. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=55.58s)]
*  But that said, do you get that impression in Israel? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=57.22s)]
*  Well you know I said it Mark from the beginning of the war that everybody stands with Israel [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=59.739999999999995s)]
*  when we're a victim. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=63.42s)]
*  The question is will they stand with Israel when we're a victor? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=65.06s)]
*  And that's a very different conversation and we're dealing as you know with a brutal enemy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=68.22s)]
*  that not only attacked us in the most horrific way on October 7th, which was given the size [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=72.58s)]
*  equivalent of about 2911s kidnapped 240 hostages in the wake of this brutal attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=80.42s)]
*  And you see as we go and we go in to actually win against this brutal enemy that is deliberately [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=89.66s)]
*  targeting us and using their own people as human shields. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=96.56s)]
*  As you know they have an entire terror tunnel network underneath Gaza. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=99.14s)]
*  It makes it very hard to prosecute the war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=104.2s)]
*  And what their plan as you know Mark is they want us to go in and civilians they're keeping [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=107.06s)]
*  as human shields and they're hoping that when Israel unintentionally targets, doesn't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=112.02s)]
*  target the civilians but when unintentionally harms those civilians and those civilians [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=116.62s)]
*  are killed that the whole world will turn against Israel because that's what's happened [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=120.94s)]
*  before. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=124.62s)]
*  And instead of blaming those civilian casualties on Hamas they blame Israel and they call for [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=125.62s)]
*  ceasefires they call for us to end this war against Hamas. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=129.76s)]
*  But we're not going to end the war against Hamas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=134.74s)]
*  We're not going to agree to ceasefire just like you wouldn't agree to a ceasefire a month [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=136.94s)]
*  after the bombing of Pearl Harbor a ceasefire with Japan or after 9-11 you'd agree to a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=140.18s)]
*  ceasefire with your enemies. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=144.78s)]
*  Israel is going to prosecute this war until Hamas is eliminated. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=146.5s)]
*  This round that we've had in Gaza as you know many rounds over the last decade or so this [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=149.5s)]
*  round in Gaza is going to be the last round. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=155.94s)]
*  We're going to eliminate Hamas' military capabilities. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=158.42000000000002s)]
*  We're going to end their political rule of Gaza and we're going to ensure that Gaza never [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=161.08s)]
*  poses a threat to the people of Israel again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=166.62s)]
*  That's the mission that we're in and the country is united behind that mission in a very powerful [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=169.66s)]
*  way and whether there's people in the United States or in Europe or elsewhere that doesn't [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=173.5s)]
*  want Israel to win, too bad. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=178.14000000000001s)]
*  Israel's going to win. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=181.06s)]
*  We are going to finish off Hamas and in doing so it's not just going to be a victory for [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  Israel it's going to be a victory for all the forces of peace and moderation in our [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=187.62s)]
*  region. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=192.5s)]
*  As you know Hamas is part of an axis of terror that begins in Tehran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=193.5s)]
*  They control Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=197.86s)]
*  They have Shia militias in Iraq that are attacking you. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=200.0s)]
*  They have Houthis in Yemen that have attacked us and they've attacked Saudi Arabia and they [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=202.76s)]
*  have Hamas and Islamic Jihad in Gaza and they have terror militias all over the world. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=207.42s)]
*  There's this axis of terror and they want Israel to lose and on the other side there's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=212.74s)]
*  Israel, there's Saudi Arabia, there's the United Arab Emirates, they're all of America's [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=217.02s)]
*  allies in the region and it's very important for us to win because when we win the forces [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=221.62s)]
*  of peace and progress win and if we lose, which we're not, but they want us to lose, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=226.78s)]
*  if we lose that axis of terror is going to grow and it's going to be a threat not just [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=231.94s)]
*  to Israel, it's going to be a threat to your moderate Arab countries in the region, it's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=235.22s)]
*  going to be a threat to Europe and ultimately it's going to be a threat to the United States. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=239.54000000000002s)]
*  That axis of terror mark I told you begins in Tehran. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=242.66s)]
*  Remember those people in Tehran they refer to Israel as the small Satan. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=246.26s)]
*  They refer to the United States as the great Satan. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=250.66s)]
*  They're leading chances of death to America and death to Israel. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=253.26s)]
*  So in actually winning this war in Israel against Hamas, we're actually protecting America [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=256.48s)]
*  and we're protecting all the forces of civilization around the world and I know people who are [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=261.14s)]
*  on our side and there are many, many as you say throughout the United States and throughout [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=266.14s)]
*  the world, they're pulling for us to win and we appreciate the solidarity and support and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=270.1s)]
*  we are going to win and we're going to win for us and win for all the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=274.94s)]
*  You know Mr. Ambassador, I'm a little perplexed. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=278.65999999999997s)]
*  Even before you folks are done, there are countries like ours, like mine, that already [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=282.82s)]
*  has decided how a post-Gaza territory is going to look, who's going to be involved, a two-state [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=290.35999999999996s)]
*  solution. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=296.46s)]
*  I imagine this annoys you a little bit, you may not voice it that way, those are Israelis [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=298.73999999999995s)]
*  who are losing their lives. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=304.26s)]
*  Their blood is being poured into the sand in Gaza. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=307.02s)]
*  Seems to me Israel should have some say on what happened since Israel took that territory [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=310.29999999999995s)]
*  after they were attacked by Egypt in the first place and gave it to the Palestinians. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=315.15999999999997s)]
*  So really a two-part question here. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=320.68s)]
*  Number one, do people understand that terrorists really aren't interested in managing a state, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=322.58s)]
*  a country? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  What Hamas wants, what Iran wants, what Hezbollah wants is a caliphate. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=329.65999999999997s)]
*  That's why they're in all these other countries, that's why they're trying to topple these [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=336.1s)]
*  so-called moderate Arab countries. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=339.42s)]
*  And these moderate Arab countries under their breath really want you to defeat Hamas and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=341.98s)]
*  they really want you to help take on Iran. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=346.02s)]
*  So they don't lose, as you were just saying, their own countries. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=348.58s)]
*  So that's number one. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=351.7s)]
*  And number two, what is this idea that the international community or one country or [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=352.7s)]
*  another, except for Israel, gets to decide the fate of the Gaza territory? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=358.22s)]
*  Well, look, Gaza is not a...we're not in a war thousands of miles away where you would [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=364.3s)]
*  be in Afghanistan or Iraq or somewhere. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=369.94s)]
*  This is literally hundreds of yards away from Israel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=372.36s)]
*  It's right across the border. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=376.86s)]
*  And so obviously we're going to have to make sure that we don't have a force that will [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=378.96000000000004s)]
*  emerge in Gaza after we finish the war that could possibly threaten Israel. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=383.06s)]
*  We're not going to allow the world to just decide what's going to be in Gaza because [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=387.02s)]
*  We can't have what happened on October 7th happen again. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=391.42s)]
*  So we're going to be involved in this throughout. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=394.58000000000004s)]
*  The prime minister said that Israel for a long time is going to have to retain overriding [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=397.06s)]
*  security responsibility. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=401.28000000000003s)]
*  And a lot of people got upset about that. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=402.28000000000003s)]
*  What he was saying is, I think, the most obvious thing in the world. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=404.70000000000005s)]
*  We have to be able to ensure that a terror organization does not re-emerge in this post-Hamas [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=408.6s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=415.18s)]
*  We're going to get rid of Hamas. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=416.18s)]
*  We're going to get rid of Islamic Jihad. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=417.18s)]
*  What's to say that two years from now or four years from now or five years from now, 10 [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=419.0s)]
*  years from now, 20 years from now, that we're not going to have a new terror organization [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=422.48s)]
*  emerge there? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=426.2s)]
*  And who's going to stop it? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=427.2s)]
*  Who's going to go after the terrorists and kill them? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=428.2s)]
*  So you see what's happening and your viewers may know about Judea, Samaria and the West [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=429.96000000000004s)]
*  Bank. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=434.68s)]
*  You see you have a Palestinian authority there. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=435.68s)]
*  They're not stopping terrorism there. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=437.68s)]
*  Israel has to go in on the ground. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=440.04s)]
*  Israeli troops have to go into cities like Jenin and Tannablus to make sure that we're [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=441.68s)]
*  rooting out terrorism there. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=445.68s)]
*  So there's no question that Israel is going to have to retain overriding security responsibility [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=447.78s)]
*  for the foreseeable future. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=452.44s)]
*  As for what we will see in Gaza the day after Hamas, that's an interesting conversation. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=453.97999999999996s)]
*  We'll have to have that with our partners in the United States, Arab partners in the [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=460.29999999999995s)]
*  region and around the world. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=465.26s)]
*  And there's a lot of different opinions about that. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=467.17999999999995s)]
*  But I'll tell you, Mark, what we're not going to have. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=468.7s)]
*  As I said, we're not going to have Hamas. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=470.82s)]
*  We're going to have to have a fully demilitarized Gaza. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=473.2s)]
*  And here's another point that I think is critical. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=476.06s)]
*  Gaza has to be de-radicalized. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=478.98s)]
*  We cannot allow any force there that's going to educate the next generation of Palestinians [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=481.48s)]
*  to hate Israel, to hate Jews, to hate America, by the way, as well. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=487.7s)]
*  We can't allow that to happen. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=491.94s)]
*  So we have to look into the schools. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=493.2s)]
*  You have to look into the mosque. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=495.0s)]
*  You have to make sure that you don't have a media and a cultural environment that is [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=496.66s)]
*  just poisoning the next generation. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=500.88s)]
*  And the best historical example I can give you for that is what happened in World War [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  II, where the United States had a decisive military victory over Germany and Japan. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=507.68s)]
*  And they put in place different regimes there and ensured that the next generation of Germans [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=513.84s)]
*  and Japanese would not be poisoned against the United States. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=518.62s)]
*  And today, Germany and Japan are two great allies of the United States. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=521.58s)]
*  What we have to have is a real change in Gaza, a real different future for the people who [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=525.5s)]
*  live in Gaza, for the Palestinians who live in Gaza, a future that can put us on some [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=530.34s)]
*  path to ultimately reaching a peaceful settlement of our conflict. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=534.7s)]
*  That has not happened in the last 30 years. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=539.38s)]
*  It hasn't. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=541.82s)]
*  Unfortunately, there were great hopes with the Oslo process that this was going to happen. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=542.82s)]
*  There was hopes that if Israel simply withdrew from the territory, which we did 17 years [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=545.6800000000001s)]
*  ago in Gaza, and Israel withdrew all of our troops from there, that somehow peace would [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=550.0600000000001s)]
*  emerge. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=554.08s)]
*  It's not going to emerge. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=555.08s)]
*  And after October 7th, Israel's not going to roll the dice with the security of its [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=556.22s)]
*  citizens. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=560.82s)]
*  And we're going to have to ensure that in Gaza, there is going to be whatever the structure [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=561.82s)]
*  will be that will be decided after the war. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=565.82s)]
*  We're going to have to make sure that there is not a force there that is building and [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=569.6600000000001s)]
*  building and building up to ultimately attack Israel. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=573.78s)]
*  And I'll tell you something, Mark. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=576.74s)]
*  There are a lot of people who are not hopeful. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=578.52s)]
*  I am actually very hopeful because I think we were living under this illusion that somehow [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=580.26s)]
*  this would all work out. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=585.4599999999999s)]
*  Somehow, if you keep talking about a two state solution, something good will happen about [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=586.4599999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=590.26s)]
*  We have to deal with the real problem of what young Palestinians are learning, what they're [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=591.26s)]
*  teaching in their schools. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=596.5s)]
*  You see diplomats around the world and they go from this capital, that capital. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=598.0999999999999s)]
*  And what did they say about the peace process? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=602.02s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=603.5799999999999s)]
*  Look at what a young Palestinian is learning in school. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=604.8199999999999s)]
*  Look at what a young Palestinian is seeing on their television screens. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=609.4s)]
*  That's going to determine the next generation. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=613.3s)]
*  And I think October 7th has put a lot of clarity into this process. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=615.1s)]
*  And right now, Israel has to defeat Hamas, completely eliminate it from Gaza and then [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=619.02s)]
*  build something else. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=623.46s)]
*  And I think in building something else, we have hope of a different future for Israel, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=625.26s)]
*  for our security, but also for Palestinians and for all our partners in the region. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=629.5s)]
*  You know, the Abraham Accords that were done just a few years ago that brought real hope [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=633.9s)]
*  to the region. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=639.12s)]
*  Well, we have other potential partners like Saudi Arabia as well. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=640.12s)]
*  And I think that if we if we have a decisive military victory in Gaza, I think the next [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=643.42s)]
*  step will be to actually hopefully to expand peace between Israel and our Arab neighbors. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=648.9399999999999s)]
*  And I think that's possible, but it will definitely not happen without a victory in Gaza. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=654.54s)]
*  A victory in Gaza against Hamas will be a blow to that axis of terror led by Iran. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=660.82s)]
*  It would be like this Iranian octopus losing an arm. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=665.86s)]
*  And the second blow would be a peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=669.7s)]
*  And I know it seems difficult to see that today, but I see a clear path towards that [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=672.9s)]
*  future. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=676.54s)]
*  And it begins by defeating Hamas in Gaza. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=677.54s)]
*  Well, you say many very important things there. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=679.86s)]
*  One of them, I think, especially so, as you're talking about the culture. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=682.66s)]
*  If you lose the culture, you lose the country. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=685.78s)]
*  And if you can change the culture, you can save society. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=689.66s)]
*  We have a cultural issue in our own country, as you no doubt have seen from Israel, what's [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=694.14s)]
*  going on in our universities, what's going on on our streets, what's going on our media. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=698.4399999999999s)]
*  It's quite disgusting. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=702.34s)]
*  Not the people, but the ruling class elites, the mouthpieces for the elites. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=704.58s)]
*  They embrace this cultural rot that's happening in the United States. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=711.02s)]
*  So it's very important what you said about changing the culture, because you can't change [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=714.1800000000001s)]
*  the politics, you can't change the government. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=718.58s)]
*  So if you don't change the culture, I think that's important. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kadcNTbT6Gw&t=720.5400000000001s)]
