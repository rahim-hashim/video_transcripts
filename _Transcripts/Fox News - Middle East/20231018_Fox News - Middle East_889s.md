# Israel says it has intel confirming terrorists are responsible for Gaza hospital blast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM)
*  Let us bring in Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner. He's an IDF spokesperson joins us now. Lieutenant [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=0.0s)]
*  Colonel Lerner, what is the latest intel indicating about the rocket strike on that hospital? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=5.2s)]
*  Thanks, Todd. Great to be here. I would say there our intelligence, our investigation, our [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=13.52s)]
*  initial high-level investigation revealed that the IDF did not conduct any strikes. We based that [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=20.32s)]
*  fact on three principles. First of all, there was no active operations by the IDF at that time. No [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=26.8s)]
*  airstrikes, no ground strikes and no naval strikes. Second, we revealed our radars that track the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=33.44s)]
*  trajectory of the rockets that were being launched out of Gaza that crossed just over the hospital, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=40.72s)]
*  the Al Ahly hospital. And third, we intercepted, our intelligence intercepted a call taking place [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=47.6s)]
*  between two Hamas terrorists that actually named the hospital and said that it was hit by a [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=55.36s)]
*  Palestinian Islamic Jihad rocket. So we're confident in our intelligence, in our information. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=62.08s)]
*  We know that there was a very huge dramatic event yesterday. The images of civilians [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=67.6s)]
*  are indeed heart-wrenching and heartbreaking, but it wasn't our doing. It was a Palestinian rocket [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=74.88s)]
*  fired and hitting Palestinian people. Unfortunately, so much of the world media [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=81.2s)]
*  prematurely reported it and named the IDF and the Israeli air forces conducting an airstrike. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=87.28s)]
*  It just goes to show the importance of professional media coverage, of fact-checking. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=92.72s)]
*  You cannot let Hamas dictate the narrative, the scene, set the scene. We just can't let that [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=100.4s)]
*  happen. And this is why we're revealing all of this, sometimes even at the potential threat that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  we might jeopardize our assets. Lieutenant Colonel, are you worried that this hospital [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=112.39999999999999s)]
*  strike will make the situation even worse for the hostages? I think what could be even worse [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=117.83999999999999s)]
*  than being held by hostage by Hamas, this terrorist, ruthless terrorist organization. Hamas knows [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=126.16s)]
*  wasn't an Israeli strike. You all know Israel does not target hospitals. We don't do that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=132.4s)]
*  So Hamas knows it for a fact. We heard the conversation. We've distributed this widespread [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=138.88s)]
*  to the media. You can find it on our social media platforms as well. This conversation between [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=143.84s)]
*  two Hamas terrorists saying, oh no, we hit the Al Ahly hospital. So I don't think that that's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  the relevant question about the hostages. The hostages need to be returned. They need, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=156.64s)]
*  there are 199 people with their families torn to pieces about their, and distraught with [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=160.32s)]
*  stress and frustration and concern for their families, for their brothers, for their sisters, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=167.68s)]
*  for their grandmothers and Holocaust survivors. All of those people that have been abducted. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=171.92s)]
*  You have this audio recording and you've already released it. And now the question becomes, how do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=177.2s)]
*  you convince the rest of the Arab world that this was not an Israeli airstrike? Because this will be [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  used to spark greater conflict in the region. Yeah, this is the challenge. This is the challenge [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=189.68s)]
*  we face. And this is exactly what Hamas is doing to mobilize and manipulate the Arab world. Indeed, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=197.04000000000002s)]
*  the messages will be going out. We've distributed all of the information also in Arabic so that the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=204.08s)]
*  Arabic world can indeed understand. And of course our diplomats will be doing their job, engaging. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=208.24s)]
*  I'm confident that we will be sharing it obviously with our colleagues and allies from the US, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=215.2s)]
*  the defense establishment. They will get our information, our intelligence. We will share [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=221.67999999999998s)]
*  it with them. We're pretty confident that that message will reverberate. Keeping in mind, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=226.95999999999998s)]
*  I've been around the block a few times on this. This is the first time we've been able in a [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=231.76s)]
*  relatively short time to get such a high level investigation on such an important issue [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=236.72s)]
*  in the space of a conflict of an ongoing war. And I think this is really a point of much credit [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=243.52s)]
*  for the IDF and it needs to be applauded. And indeed, when we move forward, we have to be very, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=250.16000000000003s)]
*  very cautious about everything Hamas is saying. These people, they butcher babies in their bedroom. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=255.60000000000002s)]
*  They wouldn't have a problem lying to an international media outlet. Yes, speaking of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=261.6s)]
*  moving forward, all eyes now in anticipation of the ground invasion whenever it may happen. But [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=266.0s)]
*  an IDF spokesman saying, quote, we are preparing for the next stages of war. We haven't said what [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=272.56s)]
*  they will be. Everyone's talking about the ground offensive. It might be something different. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=278.16s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, what could that something different be? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=285.04s)]
*  I think that that is a broad misquote of what perhaps one of my colleagues said. We are preparing [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=290.0s)]
*  for a ground mobilization. We need to be prepared for that. The toolbox of the IDF includes [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=296.24s)]
*  many things, including aerial assaults, ground assaults, naval assaults, extensive striking, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=305.2s)]
*  pin precision identification of terrorist, specific terrorists that have been involved. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=313.6s)]
*  We will defeat Hamas. We will utilize all of the tools that we have in order to implement [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=319.76s)]
*  the directives given to us by the government to make sure Hamas can never come into our bedrooms [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=325.28s)]
*  and butcher our babies ever again. That said, Lieutenant Colonel, why hasn't the ground offensive [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  begun yet? The ground offensive is just one tool. It needs to be prepared. It needs to, if and when [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=337.03999999999996s)]
*  we're instructed to do so, it will be in accordance to our battle rhythm and in accordance to the [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=343.84s)]
*  military operations, but also the international political interests and achievements we intend to [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=350.16s)]
*  gain. Klauswicz said that military and war is political intercourse by other means. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=357.12s)]
*  In order to achieve the political goals and go on, there is a timeframe that we need to conduct [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=363.6s)]
*  this. I think we need to be very, very cautious at sitting there with our stopwatches saying, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=369.68s)]
*  when is this going to happen? How is it going to happen? We need to be patient. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=374.0s)]
*  We are very, you know, there's a plan of action. If the mobilization does take place, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=378.48s)]
*  we will obviously be announcing it and you'll be able to see it. But that's an if, and it is all [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=384.48s)]
*  dependent, of course, on the government's directive. Absolutely. There are just so many unknowns right [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=390.56s)]
*  now. And one of the big ones is if you're going to be fighting a one or two front war. And then [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=395.52s)]
*  what happens if Syria becomes involved as well? I mean, Israel is one of the greatest fighting [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=400.32s)]
*  forces in the world. I don't need to convince you of that. But does Israel have the capability [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=406.08s)]
*  capability? And I also mean just the stuff, the material, the weapons to take on multiple fronts? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=411.68s)]
*  Carly, the idea is a very strong military. We are prepared to come to fight if needs be on two [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  fronts or multi fronts. You know, the land operation, if it is implemented in Gaza, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=426.71999999999997s)]
*  is a challenge. Hezbollah is a challenge. But our confidence is based on two core components, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=433.76s)]
*  our preferred professional capabilities, but also the civil cohesion around Israel, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=439.84s)]
*  around our people. You know, I'm a reservist. They called me and I dropped my everything. I [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=445.59999999999997s)]
*  gave my wife a kiss on her forehead as I left home on the 11th of on the 8th of October. And I said [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=450.0s)]
*  goodbye to my daughter and I came to the military because that's, you know, when we are in a state [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=459.52s)]
*  of war, when a terrorist can come into my house and butcher my baby, I have no other choice. So [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=463.35999999999996s)]
*  the society here is very strong and the military is emboldened and powered by that. We have to be [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=469.2s)]
*  very, very clear. An unfathomable attack that was conducted by Hamas, it can never ever be the norm [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=475.12s)]
*  of terrorism that we accept. We can't accept terrorism full stop. And this, this, the magnitude [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=482.08s)]
*  of this attack can never be accepted anywhere in the world. And I would say decent people know that [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=487.6s)]
*  decent people are standing with Israel now. As you look live at your screen right now, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=493.12s)]
*  the presidential motorcade taking president Biden through the streets of Tel Aviv and lieutenant [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=497.20000000000005s)]
*  colonel, you gave a spectacular answer in explaining why you do not believe a ground [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=503.44s)]
*  offensive has begun yet. It was thorough. It was to the point, but there's a narrative out there [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=508.96000000000004s)]
*  as we watch these pictures of the president of the United States driving in Israel, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=514.5600000000001s)]
*  there's a narrative out there that the IDF is waiting for president Biden to leave before [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=519.52s)]
*  beginning that ground offensive. How do you respond to that? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  Well, we have to keep in mind that of course there is, as I said, political interests beyond [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=530.48s)]
*  the military interests and those two need to compliment one another. I can't really confirm [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=535.6800000000001s)]
*  that that's the situation on the ground. And indeed we are very cautious and we are listening [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=540.96s)]
*  to what our American allies are saying. You know, we have, you know, and president Biden has been [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=545.84s)]
*  very, very vocal about supporting Israel and indeed we are listening to our American allies. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=551.36s)]
*  So when we look forward, we are focused on our mission as the, as the meetings take place, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=556.64s)]
*  we will continue to destroy Hamas's capability, target their leaders and disrupt any actions that [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  they are trying to conduct. You know, their rockets are 450 of their rockets launched at us [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=567.6s)]
*  in the last 12 days landed in Gaza. We saw what happens when one of them hits a hospital. We're [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=573.6800000000001s)]
*  not doing those types of actions. We're very much focused and while the politics and the diplomacy [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=579.6s)]
*  is happening, we are continuing our military operation. Yeah, Lieutenant Colonel, it's hard [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=585.52s)]
*  to imagine being in your shoes right now. I mean, like you said, you told that story about [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=591.84s)]
*  kissing your wife and going to war and I know that you were a reservist and I don't know if you ever [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=597.76s)]
*  thought that this situation would unfold certainly as rapidly as it is right now and the horrors that [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=602.32s)]
*  occurred just over a week ago are still so raw and will probably forever be. So what is your hope? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=608.4s)]
*  What is your expectation for what Israel will look like in 10 years time? [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=615.36s)]
*  Well, I'm not a prophet. I can say I was yesterday, I was in the Ichilov hospital and I met [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  survivors who had been at the music festival and I met a soldier that had been called [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=629.44s)]
*  to operate, a special forces soldier that had been called to operate in southern Israel [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=636.4s)]
*  in the aftermath of the attack. He was wounded and shot in the neck [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=644.72s)]
*  and what I saw is young men, young women with a passion of life and that I think exemplifies [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=651.9200000000001s)]
*  Israel. You know, that is, you know, we are a young but old nation. We are a powerful military, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  a professional military that is dependent on the people of Israel and when I said to my wife, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=669.4399999999999s)]
*  they're calling me, I have to go, she didn't question that. She said, yeah, you have to go [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=676.72s)]
*  and do your thing. You have to go and, you know, reflect what is going through Israel on these days. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=680.64s)]
*  So 10 years down the line, I probably couldn't answer that. We need to live in peace. We need [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=685.84s)]
*  to find that peace but it needs to be peace from a position of strength, of security and coexistence [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  and mutual respect. Unfortunately, Hamas terrorists are not a partner for any of those things. They [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=698.16s)]
*  still want to do diabolical acts. They are still holding 199 hostages. The unfathomable terrorist [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=704.3199999999999s)]
*  attack against our people 12 days ago will be a blemish on the history of mankind and it has done [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=712.88s)]
*  a huge disservice to the Palestinian people as well. I think the will of the Israeli people that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=721.04s)]
*  you just described has been echoed throughout our coverage over the last week and a half by Trey [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=727.76s)]
*  Yanks because on multiple occasions when we asked what is the mood of the Israeli soldiers, in fact, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=734.0s)]
*  he said they are scared. They know what is coming. They know that the fight will be very, very difficult, [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=741.68s)]
*  very, very bloody and deaths and casualties will occur but they are so united because [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=750.24s)]
*  this isn't a war in a foreign land. This is visceral. This happened less than 10 days ago. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=757.36s)]
*  To your point, coming into your home, killing your child, that creates something in all of us, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=764.72s)]
*  especially the Israeli people who have been under fire for decades, if you will. I think that notion [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=772.56s)]
*  of like Carly and you highlighted, you kissing your wife, you don't want to leave her but you [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=780.9599999999999s)]
*  have to leave her because this is the mission to defend not only your wife, not only your children, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=786.7199999999999s)]
*  but the entire Israeli people. I agree. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=793.68s)]
*  And it's a testament to you and it's a testament to the people. The numbers that we are seeing now, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=800.24s)]
*  360,000 up to 400,000 IDF soldiers ready to engage in a fight. Is that number still accurate? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=808.0799999999999s)]
*  Is it plus or minus? What do you know? So it's around 300,000 people that have reported for duty. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=815.8399999999999s)]
*  They are dispersed both on the front with Gaza, obviously preparing for ground maneuvering, [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=823.76s)]
*  ground mobilization. They include across all of the services, so we have Navy, Air Force and [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=830.4s)]
*  Ground Forces, the Home Front Command, offensive capabilities, defensive capabilities, but they're [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=836.8s)]
*  also for the Northern Front, for the arena with Hezbollah and potentially on the border with [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=842.9599999999999s)]
*  Lebanon. You asked about what is the potential of a two front war. Hezbollah, we've seen them [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=850.16s)]
*  escalating over the last few days now. Every single day they're firing anti-tank guided missiles [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=856.64s)]
*  towards troops on the border. They've killed soldiers, they've killed civilians doing so. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=861.76s)]
*  We've responded in kind and then some. We won't take that, we won't accept that to be a reality. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=867.4399999999999s)]
*  And yes, we've evacuated 28 communities across the border, across the frontier, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=874.3199999999999s)]
*  because that's what we do. We take care of our people, we get them out of harm's way. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MhOauKJyKPM&t=884.3199999999999s)]
