# Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh briefs the media
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 17, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY)
*  do that, but actions like that Iran took are not only destabilizing, but they fly in the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=0.0s)]
*  face of the rules-based order that we are seeking to uphold. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=7.28s)]
*  May I follow up? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=11.48s)]
*  Sure. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=12.48s)]
*  So I don't understand how my question is hypothetical. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=13.48s)]
*  It's a public statement by a U.S. official that, quote, respond through appropriate means, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=16.02s)]
*  unquote. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=25.28s)]
*  What are appropriate means in this instance? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=26.62s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to—but your—the way you had phrased it, I believe, at first was, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  if this happens, then what further actions take? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=33.92s)]
*  Well, let me just say that, again, I'm not going to forecast what means we're going [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=36.96s)]
*  to take. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=43.2s)]
*  I don't think that would be a good—I don't think it would be a good way to show our cards [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=44.2s)]
*  from here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=50.0s)]
*  I think I would let Mr. Sullivan's statements stand for itself. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=52.0s)]
*  Again, we are going to work with our partners and allies, and we continue to work with our [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=57.8s)]
*  partners and allies in the region. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  And you know, I'm not going to—I'm not just going to go down a path of, like, potentially [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=65.32s)]
*  telling you what we could or could not do. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=72.88s)]
*  I just don't think that's helpful at this time. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=74.36s)]
*  Has this incident been discussed during the phone call today between the Secretary and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=76.4s)]
*  his Israeli counterpart? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=80.92s)]
*  We'll have a readout shortly, and from there you can see what was discussed. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=81.92s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=84.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=85.72s)]
*  Anyone else here? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=86.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=87.72s)]
*  The court is spotting with Russia. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=88.72s)]
*  I have a couple of questions, if I may. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=91.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=93.60000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  My first question is about yesterday's press briefing. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  General Milley said that he tried to reach his Russian counterparts to discuss the incident [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=100.04s)]
*  in Poland, but he was unsuccessful. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=105.84s)]
*  So my question is, what did he want to accomplish with this call? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=109.24000000000001s)]
*  What was the idea behind this call? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=113.56s)]
*  I would direct you to his staff. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=115.36s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=117.36s)]
*  And my second question is about arms inspections in Ukraine. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=118.36s)]
*  Are there any findings already, or are they still on? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  I have nothing to read out at this time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=125.16s)]
*  When I do, I'll let you know. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  Anyone else? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=128.96s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=129.96s)]
*  I'm Franklin Clark from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=130.96s)]
*  Nice to see you in the briefing room. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=131.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=133.96s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=135.08s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=136.08s)]
*  Australia has been struck by a couple of pretty major cyber attacks recently, one emanating, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=137.08s)]
*  it appears, from Russia. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=140.68s)]
*  I'm just wondering, have you had, has the Defence Department had any communication with [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=141.68s)]
*  Australia about those attacks? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  And would you see such an attack at the moment? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=148.84s)]
*  It's hard to see whether or not there's speculation about whether or not it's been not orchestrated, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=151.0s)]
*  but at least with some sort of Russian government okay. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=157.4s)]
*  Would you see a similar attack in America as being an attack by a foreign entity, and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=161.72s)]
*  how would you see such an attack in Australia? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=166.4s)]
*  Well, in terms of an attack on Australia, again, cyber attacks are incredibly dangerous. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=169.32s)]
*  We have here from the department, other agencies have worked with Australian counterparts and [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=174.6s)]
*  continue to work with them. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=181.6s)]
*  I don't have a call to read out from the Secretary per se, but of course we are in touch at different [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=182.84s)]
*  levels with the Australian government. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=187.2s)]
*  In terms of your second question, I just want to, can you repeat it? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=189.96s)]
*  I just want to make sure I'm understanding it correctly. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  There's now Australia's trying to analyse exactly what this attack meant, who's behind [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=199.4s)]
*  Would you see a similar attack? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=200.4s)]
*  In this case it was Australian private information being taken, held for ransom, and although [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=201.4s)]
*  there is no direct evidence, at least publicly, that it was orchestrated by the Russian government, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=205.76000000000002s)]
*  if a similar attack occurred in the United States where people from Russia, for example, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=210.56s)]
*  were taking that kind of information, would you see that as being effectively an attack [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=217.24s)]
*  on America by a foreign country? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=222.28s)]
*  Well, again, that's a hypothetical. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=224.08s)]
*  Fortunately that has not happened, and I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals from [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=226.60000000000002s)]
*  here, but I thank you for the question, but I'm just not going to get into that. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=230.88s)]
*  Okay, yes, I'll take one more and then I'll wrap it up. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=235.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  With the recent Ukraine forces, the achievement in the battleground that they did against [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  the Russian forces, does the DOD think that Ukraine today is in a position of strength [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=244.24s)]
*  to start a negotiation with Russia? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=252.72s)]
*  Well, I would, again, and I think the Secretary and the Chairman spoke to this, it is up to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=256.12s)]
*  Ukraine to decide when they want to negotiate. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=261.16s)]
*  The Secretary convened the Ukraine contact group yesterday to work with our partners [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=265.52s)]
*  and allies around the world to ensure that Ukraine has what it needs in this war against [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  Russia. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=276.72s)]
*  And, you know, just to remind folks here, but this war could end tomorrow. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=277.72s)]
*  This war could end now. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=282.72s)]
*  Russia has the opportunity, the choice to make, to decide to pull its troops, to remove [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  its equipment, to get its systems out of Ukraine and, you know, be held responsible for invading [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=290.84000000000003s)]
*  a sovereign nation. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=299.56s)]
*  And so, you know, I would let Ukraine speak to when it's ready to negotiate, but I think [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  you heard pretty strongly from the Secretary and from the Chairman yesterday that we are [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=308.72s)]
*  committed to providing Ukraine what it needs and we are going to continue to provide Ukraine [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=315.40000000000003s)]
*  what it needs for the long haul. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=319.68s)]
*  Okay, great. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=321.20000000000005s)]
*  Thanks all. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=322.72s)]
*  Happy Friday, Thursday, happy Thursday. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=323.72s)]
*  And I will see you tomorrow. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=326.44s)]
*  Yes, see you. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=327.44s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iAi2vX40_kY&t=328.44s)]
