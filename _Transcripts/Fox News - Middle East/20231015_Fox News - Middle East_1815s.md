# Bipartisan group of senators hold press conference from Israel 10/15/2023
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ)
*  And then a few minutes ago, this press conference was delayed for the same reason. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=0.0s)]
*  So Israelis are affected all the time by Hamas's warlike attitude. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Look, there are no words for the horror that happened last Saturday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=12.0s)]
*  It shook me to my core. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=18.84s)]
*  I think about it all the time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=20.2s)]
*  I see the pictures of the little children and I think, what if my 40-year-old grand-son [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=22.16s)]
*  What if this happened to my 40-year-old grandson? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=27.4s)]
*  Most Jews killed in a single day since the Holocaust, more than on Kristallnacht. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=32.4s)]
*  It was horrible. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=39.8s)]
*  And when I was recently in China and I met with the Israeli ambassador in Beijing, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=41.9s)]
*  and that's where I first learned about what happened on a kibbutz, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=46.599999999999994s)]
*  where Hamas herded everyone, about a hundred people, into a room, a recreation room, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=50.9s)]
*  and then slaughtered them, machine-gunned every one of them down. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=57.3s)]
*  And it reminded me of a story in my family. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  My great-grandmother was the wife of a famous rabbi who had previously died in Chortki, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=63.9s)]
*  the town in western Ukraine. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=70.3s)]
*  The Nazis came in. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=73.5s)]
*  They asked her to gather her greater family on the porch. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=75.9s)]
*  Approximately 35 people gathered from ages 88 to three months. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=81.2s)]
*  The Nazis said, you're coming with us. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=86.3s)]
*  She said, we're not going. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=88.0s)]
*  And they machine-gunned every one of them down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=89.0s)]
*  So unfortunately, we all know the depth of the agony that Israel feels. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=92.3s)]
*  And the world can't move on and say, oh, well, that was yesterday. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=102.4s)]
*  Because if we don't prevent the threat from Hamas from occurring, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=108.5s)]
*  it'll happen again and again and again. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=114.5s)]
*  Let's not forget that Hamas does not believe in any Jewish state. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=117.6s)]
*  If you read some of their covenants and charters, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=123.4s)]
*  they would do to the Jewish people and the rest of Israel [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=127.3s)]
*  what they did to the people along the Gaza border. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=130.5s)]
*  They must be stopped. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=134.9s)]
*  And the viciousness of this attack, I mean, it's just wrenching. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=138.1s)]
*  Young women raped and murdered side by side. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=141.1s)]
*  Babies, throats slit in front of their parents, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=143.8s)]
*  and then they shoot the parents and so many other things that we've read about. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  So we cannot let this evil continue to prowl the earth. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=151.4s)]
*  So in the face of this horrific attack, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=157.10000000000002s)]
*  we're here to share a message of resolute solidarity. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=162.3s)]
*  We say to Israel, America will stand with its ally Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=166.70000000000002s)]
*  And I, along with my colleagues here, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=171.5s)]
*  will lead the effort in the United States Senate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=174.5s)]
*  to provide Israel with the support required to fully defend itself [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=177.3s)]
*  from this monstrous attack. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=181.9s)]
*  Again, to the Israeli people, America has your back. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  The purpose of our trip has been threefold. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=189.4s)]
*  First, to send a clear message to the Israeli people [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  that the United States stands with Israel. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=196.4s)]
*  Two, to meet with the leaders in Israel [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=199.1s)]
*  and discuss in detail what Israel needs in terms of resources, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  military, intelligence, and humanitarian, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=207.6s)]
*  and support that so we can put the best aid package together quickly. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=213.6s)]
*  And three, to show that Israel's support is bipartisan. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  Behind me are two Democrats and two Republicans. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=225.0s)]
*  They have a lot of partisan divisions in America, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=228.8s)]
*  but this isn't one of them. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=231.5s)]
*  Now, Israeli forces have already begun the work [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=235.10000000000002s)]
*  to extinguish the threat of Hamas. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=238.9s)]
*  That is a goal that has to happen. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=241.4s)]
*  There's also an important mission to rescue hostages taken by Hamas, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  many of whom are women, children, elderly, some are Americans. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=253.9s)]
*  As I said, we met with some of the families of these hostages today [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=258.7s)]
*  as a parent or grandparent. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=263.5s)]
*  It's truly heart-wrenching. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=265.2s)]
*  We wept as they told their stories. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=266.8s)]
*  They were such beautiful, brave people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=270.3s)]
*  And every second seems like a day as they're wondering [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=273.4s)]
*  what has happened to their child, to their parent, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=276.9s)]
*  to their brother, to their sister. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=279.9s)]
*  And we told them we would do everything we could, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=283.2s)]
*  including speaking to the president next week, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=286.7s)]
*  who had talked to these parents as well. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  But we're going to talk to him next week about the U.S. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=292.2s)]
*  doing everything it can to help get the hostages relieved. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=294.3s)]
*  The Biden administration and the Israeli government [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=299.9s)]
*  have assured us that that's happening. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=302.4s)]
*  Now, these are two necessary tasks, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=305.7s)]
*  eliminating the threat of Hamas once and for all and freeing hostages. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=309.4s)]
*  But these tasks are made more difficult because unlike Hamas, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=314.2s)]
*  civilized democracies like the U.S. and like Israel [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=318.59999999999997s)]
*  must hold themselves to a higher standard. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  The Biden administration has underscored that democracies like ours [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=325.0s)]
*  are stronger and more secure when we uphold the rule of law. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=329.5s)]
*  We echo that to every, to the prime minister of Israel [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=335.2s)]
*  and to every Israeli official we met. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=338.8s)]
*  We told them that as well as military assistance, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=343.5s)]
*  intelligence assistance, diplomatic assistance, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=347.5s)]
*  we wanted humanitarian assistance. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=350.8s)]
*  And I said to them, find the fastest, safest, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=353.7s)]
*  and most efficient way to do so. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=356.4s)]
*  We also told them it was really important to, and it's difficult, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=360.0s)]
*  we know it's difficult, but still we have to, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=364.9s)]
*  to minimize civilian casualties in Gaza. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=367.90000000000003s)]
*  As Senate Majority Leader, as I mentioned, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=374.0s)]
*  the highest-ranking Jewish leader in American history, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=377.6s)]
*  I'm doing everything in my power to ensure the Senate delivers [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=380.7s)]
*  the support Israel needs to accomplish these military, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=386.0s)]
*  intelligence, and humanitarian goals. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=389.3s)]
*  We will not just talk, we will act. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=392.5s)]
*  We will work to move this aid through the Senate ASAP. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=396.0s)]
*  And the Israeli leaders made it clear to us [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=400.7s)]
*  they need the aid quickly. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=402.7s)]
*  We heard from what the Israeli leaders about what is needed. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=405.8s)]
*  And in munitions, we heard about precision-guided bombs. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=409.8s)]
*  We heard about iron dome replacement. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=414.3s)]
*  We heard about 155-millimeter mortars. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=416.4s)]
*  We heard about JDAMs and many other things. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=419.0s)]
*  And we also talked about what kinds of intelligence help [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=421.9s)]
*  they needed and well as diplomatic help [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=424.7s)]
*  that we might be able to do as well. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  The needs, of course, are quickly evolving over time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=430.0s)]
*  So we will work with the Israeli government [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=434.59999999999997s)]
*  and the Biden administration to assemble [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=437.3s)]
*  the most generous package possible. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=439.5s)]
*  When I return to Washington, I'm going to direct [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=442.5s)]
*  Senators Murray, Reid, and Cardin, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=445.8s)]
*  heads of the most relevant committees, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=448.09999999999997s)]
*  to work with their ranking Republican members [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=450.3s)]
*  and the Biden administration to pull together a package [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=453.3s)]
*  that the Senate can take up as soon as possible, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=456.2s)]
*  hopefully within the next few weeks. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=459.0s)]
*  Now that people will ask, what about the House? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=462.1s)]
*  We're not waiting for the House. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=464.90000000000003s)]
*  We believe if the Senate acts in a strong bipartisan way, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=467.1s)]
*  it may indeed improve the chances that the House, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=471.2s)]
*  even with its current dysfunction, will act. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=474.90000000000003s)]
*  So the bottom line is that October 7th is a day [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=478.7s)]
*  that will no doubt live in infamy. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=481.3s)]
*  My guess is I'll think of it every day [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=485.1s)]
*  for the rest of my life, just as I think of 9-11 [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=487.0s)]
*  every day for the rest of my life. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=490.5s)]
*  And now we just want to be clear to the Israeli people [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=494.3s)]
*  during these such difficult times. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=497.5s)]
*  I talked, I just asked four random Israelis, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=499.2s)]
*  guy driving the car, waiter at the restaurant, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=502.3s)]
*  and two others I bumped into. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=504.5s)]
*  Every one of them knows somebody who's close to them [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=506.8s)]
*  who has been lost. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=510.1s)]
*  So it's such a difficult time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=512.7s)]
*  But we know the difficulty of their task, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=515.9s)]
*  but we also know success, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=519.8000000000001s)]
*  the elimination of the threat of Hamas is vital. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=522.2s)]
*  Israel has a right to defend itself [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=525.5s)]
*  and eliminate the threat to Hamas [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=528.4s)]
*  to make sure that this evil never happens again. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=530.2s)]
*  Our prayers are with all of those killed and taken hostage, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=536.5s)]
*  their families, the thousands injured. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=539.2s)]
*  May the memories of the dead be a blessing [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  and a source of strength to all of us [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=545.7s)]
*  as we navigate this challenging future [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=548.1s)]
*  with fortitude of spirit and solidarity of purpose. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=550.8000000000001s)]
*  Jackie. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=557.5s)]
*  I'm not that tall, there we go. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=563.6s)]

*  Hello everyone. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=575.2s)]
*  I'm United States Senator Jackie Spector Rosen. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=578.1s)]
*  I want to thank Leader Schumer [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=582.4000000000001s)]
*  for leading this bipartisan delegation [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=583.9000000000001s)]
*  and for my Democratic and Republican, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=586.4000000000001s)]
*  not just colleagues, but friends, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=588.7s)]
*  for joining us here today and presenting a united front. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=590.7s)]
*  And I want to thank the Israeli government for hosting us. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=594.6s)]
*  I stand here as the only Jewish woman in the Senate, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=599.3000000000001s)]
*  the only Jewish mother in the Senate, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=602.9000000000001s)]
*  a former synagogue president, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=606.2s)]
*  a steadfast supporter of Israel. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=609.0s)]
*  Israel lives in the hearts of all Jewish people. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=612.7s)]
*  We come to Israel for weddings, for bar mitzvahs, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=617.3000000000001s)]
*  to visit family and loved ones, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=620.2s)]
*  for our simchas, our joys and our sorrows. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=622.4000000000001s)]

*  But after the events of October 7th, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=629.4000000000001s)]
*  our hearts have been shattered. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=632.8000000000001s)]
*  We've seen the heart-wrenching reports [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=637.4000000000001s)]
*  showing the carnage and brutality of Hamas' terrorist attack. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=639.1s)]
*  Young people gunned down, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=642.9000000000001s)]
*  murdered trying to flee a music festival. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=644.8000000000001s)]
*  Children burned, children kidnapped. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=647.9000000000001s)]
*  Holocaust survivors ripped from their families. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=652.1s)]
*  We sat with the family members of hostages [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=655.6s)]
*  who are like Leader Schumer said, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=660.4s)]
*  every second they wait is an eternity. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=663.0s)]
*  Their lives forever changed [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=668.8000000000001s)]
*  as we wait. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=672.5s)]
*  And these details, they may sound like they're straight [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=675.8000000000001s)]
*  out of a horror movie. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=678.5s)]
*  It's a nightmare. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=680.6s)]
*  But being on the ground, meeting with those who are impacted, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=682.6s)]
*  those who have lost family, friends and loved ones, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=685.2s)]
*  I'm here to tell the world this is real. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=688.3000000000001s)]
*  This is real. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=692.8000000000001s)]
*  Do not look away. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  This is real. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=696.9000000000001s)]
*  They said I'm the only Jewish mother in the Senate. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=701.0s)]
*  And I can tell you that meeting with Israeli mothers [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=704.6s)]
*  whose children were killed, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=708.0s)]
*  hearing their stories, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=710.3000000000001s)]
*  hearing the mothers today, the daughters, the cousins, [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=712.2s)]
*  the sisters, brothers, their pain, their heartbreak. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=717.2s)]
*  I too will remember this for the rest of my life. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=722.8000000000001s)]
*  And as Jews, we know that never again. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=727.6s)]
*  Well, it means right now. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=731.7s)]
*  And that's why we're here to say the United States [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=734.8000000000001s)]
*  stands with Israel now and always. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=737.7s)]
*  Our support remains unwavering and unconditional. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=741.8s)]
*  And we as Democrats and Republicans are working [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=746.3s)]
*  to deliver our support as quickly as possible [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=749.4s)]
*  because we know, we know in this moment, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=752.8s)]
*  in this moment, in this place, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=756.0999999999999s)]
*  in this here and in this now, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=757.9s)]
*  we must take decisive action. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=761.8s)]
*  You have our commitment to do whatever, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=766.0s)]
*  provide whatever assistance you need [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=769.9000000000001s)]
*  to defend yourselves from terrorism, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=772.1s)]
*  whether it comes from Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=774.6s)]
*  or any other Iranian proxy. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=778.0s)]
*  This includes replenishing the Iron Dome [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=781.0s)]
*  so it can continue protecting innocent lives. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=783.5s)]
*  And we'll work together to get Israel additional funding [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=787.0s)]
*  to protect the Israeli people, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=790.4000000000001s)]
*  to reunite families, to rescue those who are being held [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=792.5s)]
*  hostage and to hold Iranian-backed Hamas accountable [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=797.0s)]
*  for the atrocities they have committed [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=800.5s)]
*  and they are still committing. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=803.0s)]
*  Sadly, history has shown what happens [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=808.8s)]
*  when the world abandons the Jewish people. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=813.7s)]
*  I'm here to say that America will never again [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=817.8s)]
*  abandon the Jewish state. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=820.3s)]
*  Am Yisrael, hi. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=824.4s)]
*  Senator Robin. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=828.0s)]
*  This has been a heartbreaking, heart-wrenching experience [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=834.0s)]
*  for me, for my colleagues, for you, and for the world [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=840.0s)]
*  to see the people of Israel subjected to such brutality, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=844.0s)]
*  such heinous acts by individuals whose purpose [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=849.0s)]
*  is unimaginable. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=856.0s)]
*  My heart breaks not just for our friends and allies, [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=859.0s)]
*  but for people who I love and hold dear. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=865.0s)]
*  Now, there are two things I'd like to mention, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=869.0s)]
*  because I agree with what my colleagues have just said, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=872.0s)]
*  and I'm not going to say the same thing, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=876.0s)]
*  but I want to add just two points. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=878.0s)]
*  Number one, you're going to see pictures, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=881.0s)]
*  as you can imagine and probably already have, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=884.0s)]
*  of Palestinian civilians that are going to be injured [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=887.0s)]
*  and killed by virtue of the conflict which is ongoing. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=894.0s)]
*  I hope you recognize that those individuals are being killed [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=898.0s)]
*  because of Hamas, not because of Israel. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=902.0s)]
*  In many respects, most directly, [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=906.0s)]
*  Hamas is holding their own population, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=908.0s)]
*  the Palestinian population, as human shields. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=912.0s)]
*  They're using Palestinians to protect their own lives, [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=916.0s)]
*  Hamas' lives, and therefore when Israel takes action [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=920.0s)]
*  to try and go after Hamas and to take out its leadership, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=925.0s)]
*  there will be individuals who are civilians and innocent [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=929.0s)]
*  that will be killed, and they will parade that [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=933.0s)]
*  as if this is some horror being perpetrated by Israel. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=935.0s)]
*  Do not forget, the lives that you're going to see lost [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=937.0s)]
*  on TV over the coming long period of time, potentially. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=940.0s)]
*  Israeli lives and Palestinian lives are all the result of Hamas. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=945.0s)]
*  And number two, and this is a point I think for my friends [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=952.0s)]
*  in the United States in particular, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=955.0s)]
*  there is a growing sentiment in my country of isolationism, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=957.0s)]
*  which is, you know, let's not worry about what's going on [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=962.0s)]
*  in the rest of the world. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=965.0s)]
*  Let everybody else worry about those things. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=966.0s)]
*  This is a bipartisan group that has a different point of view, [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=968.0s)]
*  which is that we want to stand with our allies [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=970.0s)]
*  and with our friends. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=972.0s)]
*  But I would note with regards to those that have isolationist tendencies [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=974.0s)]
*  that there's a war being waged, a war being waged against [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=978.0s)]
*  free countries, against democracies, against freedom. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=983.0s)]
*  And it's being waged by Hamas and Russia and China, India, [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=987.0s)]
*  excuse me, Iran. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=994.0s)]
*  There are nations, Iran, Russia, China, [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=996.0s)]
*  that want to overthrow democracies generally [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1001.0s)]
*  and subvert the cause of freedom. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  And backing away and saying, hey, we're not going to worry about it, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1009.0s)]
*  is not going to end their effort. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1012.0s)]
*  That war would only continue and spread further [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1014.0s)]
*  and ultimately involve more and more of humanity. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1017.0s)]
*  So we're involved in the world because it's in America's interest, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1021.0s)]
*  it's in Israel's interest, it's in all of our allies' interests, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1025.0s)]
*  it's in the world's interest. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1028.0s)]
*  This is obviously a period of great sadness. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1030.0s)]
*  And meeting today with the families of hostages [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1034.0s)]
*  has been something I will never forget. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1037.0s)]
*  And can only imagine, can only imagine the horror in their lives. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1041.0s)]
*  My heart reaches to them, my prayers join with yours [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1047.0s)]
*  to see those hostages return to their loved ones. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1051.0s)]
*  Thank you, Chuck. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1059.0s)]
*  Senator Rosen and I were here in January, just 10 months ago. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1061.0s)]
*  And it's really kind of shocking how much has changed. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1067.0s)]
*  We were here to sort of celebrate the Abraham Accords [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1071.0s)]
*  and all the positive benefits it brings not only to Israel, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1076.0s)]
*  but Israel's partners in this agreement. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1083.0s)]
*  And 10 months later we're back for I would say exactly the opposite reason. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1087.0s)]
*  The meetings we had today were some of the toughest I've had [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1098.0s)]
*  in my two and a half years in the United States Senate. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1103.0s)]
*  And some of the images and video that we saw were like I've never seen in my life. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1106.0s)]
*  And I spent 25 years in the United States Navy, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1113.0s)]
*  flying in combat over Iraq and Kuwait. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  I mean I'm here to say that the United States has [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1122.0s)]
*  and is going to continue to support and stand by our ally, Israel. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1127.0s)]
*  As you defend yourself from these barbaric attacks by Hamas. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1131.0s)]
*  Over the last week I've been following closely what's been going on here [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1138.0s)]
*  and speaking with many members of the Arizona Jewish community. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1142.0s)]
*  My wife, Gabby Giffords, is a member of that community. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1146.0s)]
*  And I bring a message of support from them and from so many Americans [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1151.0s)]
*  who have been deeply affected by these attacks [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1156.0s)]
*  and are thinking about the Israeli people every single day. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1159.0s)]
*  Now myself and Senator Rosen were members of the Senate Armed Services Committee [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1164.0s)]
*  and we have worked really hard to get aid for Israel over my time in the Senate. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1168.0s)]
*  And I know that's true for Senator Rosen as well. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1175.0s)]
*  But this brings this problem to a whole other entire level. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1178.0s)]
*  And we have so much more to do. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1183.0s)]
*  I understand some of these challenges that Israel is facing operationally, tactically. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1187.0s)]
*  And there are challenges ahead. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1197.0s)]
*  I mean expending a stockpile of interceptors, that is not limitless. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1199.0s)]
*  I mean that happened just tonight a couple times as we were in the shelter on the 22nd floor. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1204.0s)]
*  I will speak to members of Congress one by one if that's what it takes to get Israel the munitions [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1214.0s)]
*  that you need to defend yourselves. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1226.0s)]
*  And it's not just about these munitions. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1228.0s)]
*  I mean we're sending other support as well. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1231.0s)]
*  The USS Ford is off the coast in the Med today. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1235.0s)]
*  The Hamas terrorist organization is a threat to Israel and all who want peace. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1243.0s)]
*  And we are going to continue to stand by Israel in its self-defense. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1249.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1254.0s)]
*  Hi, I'm Senator Bill Cassidy representing the great state of Louisiana. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1263.0s)]
*  We've had a great day today. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1266.0s)]
*  Meeting with political and military leaders and at the end of the day the most powerful. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1268.0s)]
*  This is the primary audio circuit for the Reuters Live Service. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1284.0s)]

*  As we're meeting with the families, they're all Americans, almost all Americans, American Israelis, [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1392.0s)]
*  lived in New York, lived in Chicago, and so on and so on. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1398.0s)]
*  They drew hope from the relationship of the United States with Israel. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1404.0s)]
*  They drew hope from that and said, with your help, we can do this. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1409.0s)]
*  And the United States is there to help Israel. Thank you. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1415.0s)]
*  We can see the United group, whose scheme was just moved by everything we saw and heard today, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1420.0s)]
*  and our desire to help Israel is resolute. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1427.0s)]
*  A few questions just on this subject. We only detected a few of them, but yes, more. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1431.0s)]
*  Hi, my name is Sasha and I'm from Guadalajara. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1437.0s)]
*  I first expressed personal and national gratitude for the support the U.S. has been giving us. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1440.0s)]
*  It really makes me cry. It's really been moving and important and thank you. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1450.0s)]
*  Regarding the hostages and captives in Gaza Strip, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1458.0s)]
*  do you know about any humanitarian channels that are open right now in order to get out the children [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1465.0s)]
*  and the women before other, amongst other initiatives? [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1473.0s)]
*  Let me speak on behalf of trying to get all of the hostages out, Israeli and American. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1479.0s)]
*  We brought this up and spent time with every Israeli leader we talked to, including the war cabinet, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1485.0s)]
*  and we have some ideas. We are going to talk to our president about it, who was moved when he talked about hostages on Zoom. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1493.0s)]
*  And there are a number of different channels and ideas, but we've been told that to talk about those publicly would be counterproductive. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1501.0s)]
*  But there are, and we are going to push them. Anyone else? Yes. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1509.0s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. I'm Debbie Momba from the Media Line. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1515.0s)]
*  I wanted to ask what is the line that this war needs to cross before the American military engage? [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1520.0s)]
*  Israel has never asked the American military to engage. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1526.0s)]
*  The loss of life throughout the wars that Israel has fought have been Israeli lives. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1530.0s)]
*  But having the United States supply the needs of Israel is very important. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1536.0s)]
*  And having everyone in the Israeli leaders stress the importance of having our two carrier groups, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1543.0s)]
*  one is already in the Eastern Mediterranean and one is on its way, means a great deal to both Israel, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1551.0s)]
*  but also to enemies that might try to strike at Israel, showing that the force of the United States is there. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1557.0s)]
*  So I don't think anyone is asking for American troops, but American aid is much needed in a variety of different ways. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1564.0s)]
*  Yes. Go ahead, Miss General. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1572.0s)]
*  And then we'll go, well, go ahead, we'll go that way. Okay. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1576.0s)]
*  Hey, I'm Ian Bair from AFP. I appreciate your visit. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  The African Union and the Arab League have always concerns about... [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1584.0s)]
*  Say it, I didn't hear what you said. The Arab League. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1588.0s)]
*  The Arab League and the African Union have always concerns over genocide in Gaza. Do you share those concerns? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1590.0s)]
*  Look, as we have said, our goal here is very simple, to make sure that the threat of Hamas and its evilness is removed [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1597.0s)]
*  and to make sure the hostages are brought home safely. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1606.0s)]
*  We have stressed to every leader we have seen that there should be a minimization, [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1612.0s)]
*  as best can be in this difficult situation, of loss of innocent civilian life. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1618.0s)]
*  Last one. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1625.0s)]
*  Two questions. We want ABC News. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1627.0s)]
*  The person you mentioned, the lack of leadership in the Congress, how much of an influence is that? [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1630.0s)]
*  I'll answer that and then you can do your session. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1637.0s)]
*  Look, the Senate will go first. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1640.0s)]
*  We are working very hard to put together a comprehensive package to deal with so many needs that Israel has [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1643.0s)]
*  and we discussed at great length with all of the dignitaries that we met today. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1651.0s)]
*  And we're going to try to move it in the next few weeks. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1656.0s)]
*  I'm asking the heads of the three relevant committees, Patty Murray of Appropriations, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1659.0s)]
*  Jack Reed of Armed Services, and Ben Cardin of Senate Foreign Relations, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1665.0s)]
*  to work with their Republican ranking members and the administration and my office [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1670.0s)]
*  and Leader McConnell's office to put such a plan together. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1675.0s)]
*  We believe, we're not waiting for the House, plain and simple, that would be foolish, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1679.0s)]
*  but we believe if we put together a strong package and pass it with an overwhelming strong bipartisan majority, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1683.0s)]
*  it will put pressure on the House one way or another to act. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1691.0s)]
*  Second. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1695.0s)]
*  What did you discuss with the Israeli government about what's happening in the North with Israel? [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1697.0s)]
*  We had a great deal of discussion about the North and obviously Israel is very concerned about the North. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1702.0s)]
*  You saw an anti-tank missile fired today and I think it was an Israeli home and somebody died. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1708.0s)]
*  But Israel hopes they don't have to fight a two-front war, North and South, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1716.0s)]
*  but is prepared if they have to, to do it and win both in the North and the South. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1723.0s)]
*  Thank you everybody. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1729.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1738.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1768.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_q9e_q93vkQ&t=1798.0s)]
