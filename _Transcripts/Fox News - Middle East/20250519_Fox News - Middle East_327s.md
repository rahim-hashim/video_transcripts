# Iran threatens Trump admin: Enrichment will continue 'with or without a deal'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ)
*  President Trump will hold a high-stakes phone call with both Russian President Vladimir Putin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=0.0s)]
*  and a separate phone call with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky later today. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=5.2s)]
*  And Special Envoy Steve Witkoff is optimistic about these talks. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=10.0s)]
*  I believe that the president is going to have a successful call with Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  They know each other. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=21.34s)]
*  The president is determined to get something done here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=22.6s)]
*  And hopefully, if he can't do it, then nobody can. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=26.78s)]
*  This comes on the heels of Russia launching one of the largest drone barrages of this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=31.16s)]
*  war, deploying 273 drones into Ukraine. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=35.46s)]
*  U.S. Ambassador to NATO, Massie Whitaker, joins me now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=40.660000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you so much for joining us ahead of this 10 a.m. phone call. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=44.620000000000005s)]
*  So do you think that Vladimir Putin is stringing President Trump along here regarding these [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  peace talks, or is there a real path forward? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=54.58s)]
*  And if so, how will the president be able to tell during this phone call? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=58.04s)]
*  Well, good morning, Carly. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=61.42s)]
*  It's good to be with you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=64.48s)]
*  You know, I think President Trump is uniquely positioned to get a deal done if a deal is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=66.66s)]
*  to be had. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=73.18s)]
*  I think Special Envoy Witkoff is absolutely right. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=74.18s)]
*  You know, Vladimir Putin will listen to President Trump, and I think President Trump's decisive [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=78.18s)]
*  diplomacy is forging a Russia-Ukraine ceasefire, which is delivering on the America First leadership [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=82.94s)]
*  and the peace that he has promised. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=90.22s)]
*  Remember, you know, Donald Trump on all fronts is working towards ending the killing, ending [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=92.02s)]
*  the fighting and having peace across the globe. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=96.74s)]
*  And I think a lasting Russia-Ukraine agreement, you know, the president is going to put together [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=100.56s)]
*  here, even if it's happened a little slower than a lot of people think, is putting a, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=107.1s)]
*  you know, the United States in a position of global influence in securing our strategic [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=113.0s)]
*  interests and making sure that we don't have these endless conflicts that reduce our intake [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  American resources. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  And so I think we're in a good position, Carly. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=124.58s)]
*  So after this phone call with Vladimir Putin, he's then going to hop on a phone call with [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=126.76s)]
*  the Ukrainian president and then hold another phone call with Vladimir Zelensky and NATO [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=130.84s)]
*  leaders, which is where you come in. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=136.22s)]
*  How significant will that phone call with NATO leaders and Vladimir Zelensky be? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=138.68s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, this war is a hot war on the European continent. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  I think a lot of people didn't think we'd see something like this after World War II. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=150.4s)]
*  But here we are again with about 5,000 young men and civilians dying every week on the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=155.12s)]
*  battlefield and as a consequence of this war. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=161.96s)]
*  And so, you know, getting our European allies on board, obviously, they've formed the Coalition [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=165.02s)]
*  of the Willing, which is talking about peacekeeping and making sure that the war doesn't fire [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=170.72s)]
*  up again after this ceasefire is hopefully agreed to very soon. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=176.66000000000003s)]
*  And so, you know, all these calls are important, but certainly the call with Vladimir Putin, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=181.38s)]
*  who said he was going to show up last Thursday in Turkey and didn't show up, I think, you [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  know, this is going to be crucial that President Trump has this call and makes sure that Vladimir [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=194.18s)]
*  Putin is committed to peace. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=199.22s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=200.22s)]
*  He didn't show up. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=201.22s)]
*  Yeah, he didn't show up, but there were hostages released or at least negotiated upon or prisoners. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=202.22s)]
*  So that is good news there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=207.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's move forward to the Middle East. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=209.0s)]
*  The Trump administration, through Steve Witkoff over the weekend, said that, made it clear [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=210.14s)]
*  that the Trump administration's position on Iran enrichment is 0 percent. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=213.98s)]
*  And then Iran's foreign minister posted on X, if the U.S. is interested in ensuring that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=220.04s)]
*  Iran will not have a nuclear weapon, a deal is within reach and we are ready for a serious [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=224.02s)]
*  conversation to achieve a solution that will forever ensure that outcome. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=228.82000000000002s)]
*  Enrichment in Iran, however, will continue with or without a deal. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  So where do things go from there with the foreign minister saying that? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=237.94s)]
*  Yeah, obviously, Steve Witkoff said that that was the red line was to continue in enrichment. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=242.98000000000002s)]
*  And I think that may be a little bit of political posturing and trying to appeal to maybe the [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=249.18s)]
*  domestic Iranian audience to keep them happy as to where this is going. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=254.70000000000002s)]
*  But it's very clear what the position of the United States is. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=259.82s)]
*  And again, this is another area where Donald Trump uniquely is bringing peace. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=262.74s)]
*  He doesn't want to fight with Iran, but at the same time, Iran cannot have a nuclear [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=268.42s)]
*  weapon. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=273.66s)]
*  And so the position of the United States is very clear. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=274.66s)]
*  And I think the Iranians understand that and they don't want a war with the United States [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=277.14s)]
*  either. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=281.7s)]
*  And so I think we will again, President Trump will bring peace to this situation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=282.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=285.78s)]
*  The president said that he's extended an olive branch, but it will not last forever. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=286.78s)]
*  And the Ayatollah certainly did not like the president's trip to the Middle East. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=290.7s)]
*  He made that very clear in his truth social post. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=294.08s)]
*  So if the Ayatollah is comfortable, that means that President Trump's trip to the region [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=297.06s)]
*  was successful. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=302.53999999999996s)]
*  Ambassador Whitaker, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=304.02s)]
*  It's certainly going to be another very busy week. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=306.98s)]
*  We appreciate you joining us. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=309.38s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=310.58s)]

*  And tell Todd hello for me. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=312.58s)]
*  I certainly will. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=313.82s)]
*  Hi, Ambassador. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=314.82s)]
*  He's next to me. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=315.82s)]
*  He says hi. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1YsL7y0hJQ&t=316.82s)]
