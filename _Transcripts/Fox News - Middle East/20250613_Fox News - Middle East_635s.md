# BREAKING: Israel launches new wave of attacks as Trump issues chilling warning to Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE)
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear enrichment program. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=0.0s)]
*  We struck at the heart of Iran's nuclear weaponization program. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=4.04s)]
*  We targeted Iran's main enrichment facility in Natanz. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=8.1s)]
*  We targeted Iran's leading nuclear scientists working on the Iranian bomb. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=11.68s)]
*  We also struck at the heart of Iran's ballistic missile program. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Early this morning, multiple explosions were heard at Iran's Natanz nuclear power facility. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=21.54s)]
*  Iran this morning says that that site has not been destroyed, although Israel this morning [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=26.42s)]
*  saying that that center has been severely damaged. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=30.3s)]
*  Other reports that it has been destroyed. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=33.46s)]
*  So Iranian state media today also saying that three military commanders in the Iranian regime [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=35.7s)]
*  were killed, as well as six nuclear scientists who were killed. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=40.68s)]
*  And Iran's ministry issued the following statement, saying, quote, the aggressive actions of the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=44.7s)]
*  Zionist regime against Iran could not have been carried out without the coordination [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=48.94s)]
*  and with the approval of the United States. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=53.3s)]
*  Thus, the U.S. government is the main supporter of this regime will be held responsible for [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=55.66s)]
*  the dangerous consequences of Israel's adventurism. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=60.379999999999995s)]
*  Now, U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio issued a statement as well, saying, quote, we are [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=63.7s)]
*  not involved in strikes against Iran and our top priority is protecting American forces [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=69.06s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=74.38s)]
*  It was 3 a.m. this morning when sirens blared across the country, waking millions of people [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=75.38s)]
*  in Israel, telling them to get to shelters. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  Defense minister declared a special state of emergency after this elaborate strike in [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=83.5s)]
*  anticipation for the Iranian attack that would likely follow. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=88.26s)]
*  And Israel says that Iran launched 100 drones in retaliation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=92.62s)]
*  Jordan says it was able to strike down some of those drones over its air force. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=96.98s)]
*  And Israel says that its air force, the fighter jets, were able to take out many of those [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=102.22s)]
*  drones before they reached Israeli airspace. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=106.62s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=109.58000000000001s)]
*  Alex, any word if those 100 drones made it into Israel? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=110.7s)]
*  Did the Iron Dome prevent that? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=113.82s)]
*  The fighter jets were able to be up in the air and striking down these drones before [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=117.58s)]
*  they entered Israeli airspace, a major sigh of relief for people who, again, woke up at [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=121.7s)]
*  three in the morning rushing to those shelters, waiting for word of when and if it would be [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=126.66s)]
*  safe and whether or not the Iron Dome would be overwhelmed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=131.82s)]
*  So we do have a little bit of clarity. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=135.42s)]
*  As of now, the Home Command has told people they are allowed to go a little further out [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=137.5s)]
*  from their home. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=141.74s)]
*  They do not need to stay in their shelter or right next to their shelter. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=142.74s)]
*  But still, the streets are empty. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=146.26000000000002s)]
*  People are inside. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=148.58s)]
*  There is no public gathering allowed today or throughout the coming days, as the IDF [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=149.78s)]
*  warned just about an hour ago that this likely could continue, as again, we are following [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=155.14000000000001s)]
*  these new reports of another wave of potential strikes taking place right now in Iran. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=159.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=164.62s)]
*  Roger that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=165.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=166.78s)]
*  So a lot of people are wondering what does this mean for the United States? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=167.78s)]
*  Are we going to get inserted in this war? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=170.74s)]
*  What about the talks that were going on between the United States and Iran? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=173.86s)]
*  I had the opportunity to talk with the president this morning. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=177.38s)]
*  He said it didn't have to go down like this. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=179.74s)]
*  I wanted peace. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=181.66s)]
*  I want to be known as the president of peace. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=182.66s)]
*  This is why I took a whole tour in the Middle East. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=184.66s)]
*  He has since released a statement, and I really think it goes into the mind of what he was [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=187.26s)]
*  thinking from the very beginning. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  This is what the president says. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=193.78s)]
*  I gave Iran a chance after chance to make a deal. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=195.42s)]
*  I told them in the strongest of words to just do it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=199.14s)]
*  But no matter how hard they tried, no matter how close they got, they just couldn't get [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=202.85999999999999s)]
*  it done. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=207.57999999999998s)]
*  I told them that it would be much worse than anything they know, anticipated or were told [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=208.57999999999998s)]
*  that the United States makes the best and the most lethal military equipment anywhere [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=215.18s)]
*  in the world by far, and that Israel has a lot of it with much more to come. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=219.5s)]
*  And they know how to use it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=224.26s)]
*  Certain Iranian hardliners spoke bravely, but they didn't know what was about to happen. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=226.06s)]
*  They are all dead now, and it will only get worse. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=230.78s)]
*  There has already been great death and destruction, but there is still time to make this slaughter [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=234.17999999999998s)]
*  with the next already planned attacks being even more brutal come to an end. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=239.17999999999998s)]
*  Iran must make a deal before there is nothing left and save what was once known as the Iranian [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=244.42s)]
*  Empire. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=249.5s)]
*  No more deaths, no more destruction. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=250.5s)]
*  Just do it before it is too late. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=252.66s)]
*  God bless you all, Charlie. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=255.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=257.74s)]
*  You know, it's interesting to listen to that statement. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=258.74s)]
*  There is sort of an arm's length where the president is saying, you know, I've tried [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=263.06s)]
*  to negotiate with both sides, and specifically Iran has not sort of come along. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=266.58s)]
*  Last night when we first started getting reports of this, Marco Rubio, Secretary of State, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=272.74s)]
*  was saying that this was a unilateral action, meaning that it was not something that the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=279.94s)]
*  United States was involved in, however much they might have known about it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=282.58s)]
*  He went on to say that America's priority was safeguarding Americans and American interests [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=287.62s)]
*  in the region, and that Israel was acting out of self-defense. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=294.26s)]
*  All of that, I thought, I think is interesting, because it is sort of more of an arm's length [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=298.26s)]
*  than we have seen from administrations previously. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=303.34s)]
*  What they're saying is that, you know, we want peace. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=308.38s)]
*  Israel is acting on its own right now. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=312.34s)]
*  But the problem is, if Iran retaliates and retaliates against the United States' interests, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=314.84s)]
*  it's going to be a completely different deal. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=320.86s)]
*  Well, President Trump said sitcom is on high alert, and the U.S. will defend itself and [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=323.54s)]
*  Israel if Iran does retaliate. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=327.58s)]
*  Israel sent in 200 fighter jets. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=330.7s)]
*  They hit 100 targets. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=332.34s)]
*  The world can't allow a number one state sponsor of terror to make nuclear weapons. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=334.38s)]
*  Iran's breakout time, we're being told, was about a month. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=339.02s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu said that the military assessed Iran currently has enough enriched [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=341.78000000000003s)]
*  uranium to build 15 nuclear bombs, and Iran, through its proxies, they fired tens of thousands [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=346.22s)]
*  of missiles into Israel over the past years. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=352.58s)]
*  So how would America respond if hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands of missiles [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=355.3s)]
*  are lobbed into America? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=361.02s)]
*  We would respond the same way. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=362.46000000000004s)]
*  Iran was given every chance under Donald Trump to negotiate a deal. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=364.02s)]
*  They were supposed to even talk this weekend. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=367.7s)]
*  We're being told Iran is saying that that probably will not be happening. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=370.02s)]
*  Donald Trump told Brett Baer last night that we were not involved in this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  Trump was aware beforehand of these strikes and that he hopes that Iran will return to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=377.9s)]
*  the negotiating table. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=384.02s)]
*  They're going to definitely try for that. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=385.82s)]
*  There are several people in leadership that will not be coming back, he says, referring [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=387.14s)]
*  to the fact that they are now dead. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=391.26s)]
*  They killed three generals. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=393.1s)]
*  Israel had a successful operation. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=395.06s)]
*  I think you really have to look at this two ways. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=396.54s)]
*  Yes, the United States wasn't directly involved, but as the president notes in his statement, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=400.14s)]
*  Israel has our weapons as well. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=405.74s)]
*  And we will defend Israel if it's come necessary. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=407.82s)]
*  He also says that he tried to give them the opportunity to have peace. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=411.62s)]
*  He warned them that their people would die, that their leadership would die. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=415.06s)]
*  Just come to the negotiating. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=419.06s)]
*  You can't have enrichment. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=420.1s)]
*  You can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=421.62s)]
*  Just sign a deal. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=423.02s)]
*  And I think once we got to an area where Israel was worried that there could be some attack [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=425.18s)]
*  on their people, I mean, we just had October the 7th. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=431.38s)]
*  And I think honestly Israel would have attacked a lot sooner if a lot of these folks didn't [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=434.58s)]
*  have the hostages. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=439.34000000000003s)]
*  And so I think we're getting to the period of time right now where the walls are closing [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=440.86s)]
*  in. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=445.5s)]
*  Iran still has an opportunity, although because of the radical agenda and their ideology, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=446.5s)]
*  I think there will be some sort of response from Iran. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=451.42s)]
*  But they could put the brakes on this. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=454.38s)]
*  They could choose the peace that Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries have done [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=456.3s)]
*  under this administration. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=462.62s)]
*  But unfortunately, the leaders there, I mean, essentially the Ayatollah is underground right [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=464.36s)]
*  now, hiding right now because he's so fearful. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=470.26s)]
*  Don't forget what Iran's Ayatollah has always said. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=472.74s)]
*  Death to America is not just a slogan. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=475.7s)]
*  It is a policy openly threatening to wipe both Israel and the U.S. off the face of the [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=478.42s)]
*  map. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=483.7s)]
*  And we're also being told that Israelis, you heard Alex's report, that many of them are [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=484.7s)]
*  being told or they're all being told to prepare your shelters for long-term use. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=488.02000000000004s)]
*  Many of them were rushing to the grocery store before they had that call to stay home to [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=491.98s)]
*  get water, bottled water, and a lot of supplies. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  And so, you know, as you pointed out, IDF believes that Iran has the capacity to build [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=499.02000000000004s)]
*  as many as 15 nuclear weapons within days. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=504.1s)]
*  They have a matter of days of a ramp up. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=508.21999999999997s)]
*  And so you have to sit here and wonder, you know, this could be, you know, who knows? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=511.9s)]
*  There have been a lot of cases in the past where Iran has talked a big game and then [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=517.22s)]
*  wound up not being able to match the actions with their words. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=522.02s)]
*  But if indeed, you know, this is not from just Iran, this is from the IDF, if they are [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=527.78s)]
*  days away from being able to turn that nuclear material into weapons, then we could be looking [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=532.82s)]
*  at days away from a nuclear-armed Iran. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=539.58s)]
*  So the president had a vision for Iran. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=544.74s)]
*  It was really a peaceful vision, just like he has tried to do in all of the Middle East [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=548.5s)]
*  with the Abram Accords as well. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=552.6800000000001s)]
*  This is what the president said before this attack. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=555.0200000000001s)]
*  Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=558.46s)]
*  But with that said, Iran can have a much brighter future, but will never allow America and its [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=562.3s)]
*  allies to be threatened with terrorism or nuclear attack. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=575.14s)]
*  The choice is theirs to make. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=579.26s)]
*  We really want them to be a successful country. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=581.3s)]
*  We want them to be a wonderful, safe, great country. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=583.98s)]
*  But they cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=587.62s)]
*  This is an offer that will not last forever. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=589.94s)]
*  The time is right now for them to choose. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=594.38s)]
*  Right now, we don't have a lot of time to wait. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=597.14s)]
*  Things are happening at a very fast pace. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=600.78s)]
*  They're happening right here. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=603.1s)]
*  They're happening at a very fast pace. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=604.7s)]
*  So they have to make their move right now. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=606.96s)]
*  One way or the other, make your move. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=610.58s)]
*  Later on in the program, we're going to be having breaking coverage all morning. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=614.74s)]
*  General Jack Keene is going to be on the show, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=618.1800000000001s)]
*  the great one Mark Levin is going to be coming up in the show. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXMAzuha0WE&t=621.82s)]
