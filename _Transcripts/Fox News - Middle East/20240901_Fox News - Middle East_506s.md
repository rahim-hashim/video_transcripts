# Donald Trump warns Israel is 'gone' if Iran gets a nuclear weapon
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg)
*  The book goes through not just the presidency, the campaign, your family and your life. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=0.0s)]
*  Save America. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=11.02s)]
*  A horrendous day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=12.02s)]
*  You were almost murdered. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=13.22s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=14.22s)]
*  Six, seven weeks ago. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=15.22s)]
*  Six, seven weeks ago. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=18.22s)]
*  For the media, it's like it never happened. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=21.0s)]
*  I'm curious about this. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=24.38s)]
*  Did George W. Bush ever send you a note or ever call you or anything of that sort? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=26.18s)]
*  You know, I've gotten so many I don't know. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=32.7s)]
*  Not much of one. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=36.38s)]
*  So it's possible. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=38.74s)]
*  I hated that he got us into the Middle East. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=39.74s)]
*  I just hated it. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=41.38s)]
*  We spent nine trillion dollars, blew the hell out of the place and we left. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=42.94s)]
*  There's never anything, you know, in the old days to the victor belong the spoils. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=48.14s)]
*  I used to say, but I was a civilian, so who's going to listen? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=51.58s)]
*  But I'd say don't go into Iraq. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=55.1s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=57.06s)]
*  But if you are, keep the oil. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=58.06s)]
*  So Iraq has hundreds of billions of dollars worth of oil right now. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=59.82s)]
*  We spent a fortune with Saddam Hussein and all of the things we did. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=63.0s)]
*  Should have never gone in. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=67.94s)]
*  We decapitated the enemy of Iran. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=68.94s)]
*  Now Iran essentially, it's like a subsidiary of Iran, but they have hundreds of billions [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=73.06s)]
*  of dollars. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=79.06s)]
*  Four years ago, Iran had no money. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=81.22s)]
*  They had no money for any of these terrorist organizations. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=82.78s)]
*  So they had no money so they could attack Israel. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=85.78s)]
*  Now they have a lot of money. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=89.26s)]
*  Iran has almost 300 billion dollars. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=90.42s)]
*  They've got Iraq that has almost 300 billion dollars. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=92.86s)]
*  It's a lot of money. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=95.14s)]
*  And they made it in three and a half years. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=96.66s)]
*  Iran made all this money in three and a half years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=99.38s)]
*  People couldn't buy oil from them. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=102.32s)]
*  They weren't allowed by me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=103.84s)]
*  And I'm not looking to be enemies with Iran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=105.84s)]
*  I'd love to get along with them. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=108.58s)]
*  Great. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=110.3s)]
*  But they can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=111.3s)]
*  I just can't let them have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=112.38s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=114.53999999999999s)]
*  If they do have a nuclear weapon, Israel is gone. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  It'll be gone. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=118.58s)]
*  Israel is under tremendous pressure right now. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=119.58s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=122.58s)]
*  If you go back 15 years or even less, the strongest lobby in that sense in the United [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=123.82s)]
*  States was Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=131.06s)]
*  You couldn't say a thing about Israel, Christian or Jew. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=132.85999999999999s)]
*  You couldn't say anything about today. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=137.82s)]
*  It's like under siege. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=140.06s)]
*  You look at AOC plus three, you look at these people, the way they talk about it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=141.98s)]
*  And then you see Schumer, who's become a Palestinian, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=147.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, he's actually become like a Hamas agent. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=150.62s)]
*  Schumer, how did that happen? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=154.62s)]
*  Let me ask you about that. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=157.06s)]
*  You see the outbreak of anti-Semitism in our streets. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=161.26s)]
*  Tremendous. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=163.7s)]
*  Yep. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=164.7s)]
*  That wasn't happening when you were president. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=165.7s)]
*  But it didn't happen when I was president. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=167.38s)]
*  You sign an executive order extending the Civil Rights Act to cover Jewish students [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=170.22s)]
*  in their free speech, which Jewish students are using now to defend themselves in these [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=175.98s)]
*  Ivy League colleges. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  You see what's going on in the streets. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=182.98s)]
*  Do you think this administration, you know, they give a speech here and there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=185.7s)]
*  Do you think they've done enough to fight this? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=190.38s)]
*  Because colleges are opening now and they're saying it's going to happen again and it's [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=193.88s)]
*  going to get worse. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=197.38s)]
*  And people are running for their lives and they're hiding and so forth. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=198.38s)]
*  When you see that, what do you think? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=201.22s)]
*  What's getting worse? I just see Cornell is is a hotbed right now today. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=203.1s)]
*  All of the what's happening up there. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=208.46s)]
*  So right now, it's a little bit early, but as colleges are starting to open, Cornell [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=211.26s)]
*  was the occasion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=217.22s)]
*  It looks like it's worse than ever. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=219.18s)]
*  And they don't respect this administration. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=221.5s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=225.22s)]
*  You know, the power that you have with all of the endowments and everything else, the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=226.82s)]
*  big tax breaks that they get, you have tremendous powers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=230.02s)]
*  But the heads of these schools seem like either they're weak and pathetic or they're sort [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=233.9s)]
*  of Marxists themselves, fascists, Marxists. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=239.38s)]
*  One of the people, one of the professors was on from Cornell today and he was talking about [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  how the head people at the school are almost encouraging the students to destroy the place. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=247.6s)]
*  It was actually an amazing statement. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=255.0s)]
*  You think you could see them cowering in a corner, but I can't see that they're actually [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=256.6s)]
*  helping it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=262.48s)]
*  And it's shocking when you look at Columbia from last year. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=263.48s)]
*  But it looks like it's going to get very bad. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=265.76000000000005s)]
*  Actually, it looks like it's going to get very bad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=268.04s)]
*  It's a little bit early yet. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=270.04s)]
*  The season's just beginning. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=271.04s)]
*  Schools are starting to open up. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=273.56s)]
*  They haven't most of them haven't opened yet. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=275.56s)]
*  But the ones that have, it's nasty. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  It's nasty. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  And the government does nothing about it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=281.18s)]
*  Would you consider federal funds to go into these schools? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=283.0s)]
*  You have tremendous power over those schools. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  It seems to me we blackmail institutions all the time with federal funds. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=288.84s)]
*  The Democrats do too, but not here. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=293.23999999999995s)]
*  They just seem to have wide berth to go for it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=297.0s)]
*  Well also speech. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, you're not allowed to, if you're Jewish and talking about a positive Jewish event [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=301.03999999999996s)]
*  or whoever you may be, or if you're conservative even, you can't, they won't let you speak. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=307.64s)]
*  So I wrote out an order, a very strong order, and everybody went and spoke. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=314.04s)]
*  But that doesn't mean they love it. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=318.16s)]
*  We put a big order that they have to pay massive penalties if they don't let conservatives [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=319.64000000000004s)]
*  speak. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=323.64000000000004s)]
*  We did a lot for Jewish people because we were able to, you know, we were able to turn [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=325.84000000000003s)]
*  that tide, but now it's turning back. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=332.08000000000004s)]
*  And Biden does nothing. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=334.48s)]
*  How a Jewish person can vote for a Democrat, but specifically somebody like Kamala, she [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=336.04s)]
*  wouldn't even meet with Bibi when he was, look, he came over, he's the prime minister [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=343.2s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=348.44s)]
*  He's in a war. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=349.88s)]
*  We're heavily invested in that war. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=351.56s)]
*  People are dying. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=353.46s)]
*  October 7th was a horrific day, just horrific. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=354.46s)]
*  And now you see people that are picketing, they're saying no such thing ever happened. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=357.76s)]
*  You know, they did that with the Holocaust too. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=362.24s)]
*  They said there was no Holocaust. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=363.88s)]
*  But this one was right next to us because we saw it. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=366.28s)]
*  We saw it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=368.71999999999997s)]
*  You saw it. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=369.71999999999997s)]
*  Everybody saw it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  They saw it. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=371.71999999999997s)]
*  And they aren't thinking straight. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=373.24s)]
*  They must know it happened. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=374.76000000000005s)]
*  But they are, I think, you know, they're interviewing people like that are rioting. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  What about October 7th? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=381.36s)]
*  It never happened. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=382.44000000000005s)]
*  Now either they're conning us or they really believe it never happened. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=384.36s)]
*  And that's maybe worse. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  But what's happened is amazing. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=390.04s)]
*  What's happened to our country is amazing. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=393.0s)]
*  We had a country four years ago. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=394.56s)]
*  We were respected as a country. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=397.46000000000004s)]
*  We're not respected anymore. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=398.92s)]
*  So many bad decisions. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=400.16s)]
*  The worst in terms of prestige was Afghanistan. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=401.8s)]
*  It was handled so badly. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=405.88s)]
*  I'm convinced Putin would have never gone in if I were president. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=408.52s)]
*  But even with Biden as president, if he didn't do the Afghani and not getting out, I was [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=411.88s)]
*  getting out. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  I would have been out faster than him. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=419.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm the one that prepared to get out. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=421.92s)]
*  But I would have kept Bagram, the big air force base, which is one hour from where China [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=423.64s)]
*  makes its nuclear weapons. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=427.74s)]
*  A massive base that we built many years ago with billions and billions of dollars. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=429.66s)]
*  Runways are the most powerful anywhere in the world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=435.02s)]
*  They can carry more cargo than any other runway. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=437.42s)]
*  You know, the massive thick concrete goes down to almost China, which is right next [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=439.46s)]
*  to our but big, heavy slab concrete runways. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=445.74s)]
*  You almost couldn't build something like that today. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=452.1s)]
*  We walked away and one day it's gone and China now occupies it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=454.18s)]
*  We were one hour away from where they make their nuclear weapons. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=459.02000000000004s)]
*  But so I was getting up, but we're going to get out with dignity and strength. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=462.42s)]
*  And, you know, for 14 months, we had nobody 18 months, we had nobody killed. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=465.58000000000004s)]
*  They were killing. And I spoke to Abdul, the leader, and they didn't kill after that. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=470.90000000000003s)]
*  They never killed. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=474.66s)]
*  There were snipers. You know, we had the snipers and they were knocking off our guys, a lot [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=476.06s)]
*  of them during the Obama years. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=479.94s)]
*  And I spoke to him. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=483.14000000000004s)]
*  I said, don't do it. Just don't do it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=485.06s)]
*  When Putin saw Afghanistan, I think you know, you've heard that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=487.3s)]
*  That's a theory. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=490.3s)]
*  But he saw such weakness and he said, wow, that's not the country that I thought it was. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=491.3s)]
*  And I think if you didn't have Afghanistan, probably, possibly he wouldn't have gone in. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ULimTa8byBg&t=497.18s)]
