# These are ‘Holocaust-like visuals’: Yair Lapid
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ)
*  I wonder how Israelis feel about this when they see this, since the overwhelming majority, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=0.0s)]
*  not all, but the overwhelming majority are of the pro-Palestinian bent. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=4.16s)]
*  Let's ask Gaiyar Lapid, the Israeli Knesset opposition leader. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=8.0s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, very good to have you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=11.4s)]
*  Thank you, Neil. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=14.16s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=15.16s)]
*  No, thank you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=16.16s)]
*  So let me ask you, how do you feel? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=17.16s)]
*  Sorry, I mean, regardless of the politics, we'll get into your thoughts on Benjamin [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=19.16s)]
*  that you should go, but on these protests that increasingly are of the pro-Palestinian [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=23.36s)]
*  bent, not pro-Israeli. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=29.88s)]
*  Now there are many pro-Israeli measures. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=31.799999999999997s)]
*  I don't mean to say it's, you know, your country isn't being represented here, but overwhelmingly [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=33.28s)]
*  it's against Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=39.4s)]
*  So does that bother you? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=41.16s)]
*  Yes, of course it does. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=42.96s)]
*  I mean, hundreds and thousands of our people were slaughtered, babies were beheaded, people [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=44.96s)]
*  were burned alive. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=49.96s)]
*  We have 239 people who are abducted, including Abigail, who's three years old, and Kfir, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=51.96s)]
*  who's 10 months old. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=58.480000000000004s)]
*  And then they're going there and shouting what? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=60.84s)]
*  That they want more people to die? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=63.92s)]
*  All those people who are marching and saying, free Palestine, I have a suggestion for them. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=66.16s)]
*  It's an old one. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=70.44s)]
*  It's not mine. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=71.44s)]
*  If the Palestinians will lay down their weapons and stop killing Jews, they will have a state. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=72.44s)]
*  If we will lay down our weapons, we will be killed until the last one of us. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=78.64s)]
*  And this is why we are protecting ourselves. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=83.56s)]
*  And it's not like they don't understand it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=86.24s)]
*  They just ignore it because shouting genocide sounds to them like something progressive [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=88.08s)]
*  and interesting. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=93.9s)]
*  So why in the middle of that, Mr. Lapid, would you be advocating the leader of the country [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=96.92s)]
*  stepping down? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=101.8s)]
*  You don't think that Prime Minister Netanyahu has done a good job, I guess, but maybe you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=103.36s)]
*  can explain. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=108.14s)]
*  Well, it is not exactly what I've said. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=109.14s)]
*  I'm not going to get into Israeli politics in international media. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=111.9s)]
*  We are in this together. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=116.26s)]
*  It's a war. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=118.82s)]
*  The entire people of Israel is fighting together. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=119.82s)]
*  We have arguments how to deal with it, how to run it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=123.02s)]
*  But I'm not going to sit on American television, if you'll excuse me, and discuss the question [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=126.48s)]
*  who should run this country these days. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=131.02s)]
*  But you did, though. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=134.46s)]
*  You did say that he should be removed, that the time has come. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=136.22s)]
*  You want to form a new governing coalition, still led by someone from the Likud party, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=140.54000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Netanyahu's party, just not Mr. Netanyahu. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=146.22s)]
*  Why? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=150.18s)]
*  Well, right now, what I'm trying to do, what every other Israeli is trying to do, is to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=151.18s)]
*  make sure our people are being brought back home. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=157.54000000000002s)]
*  I marched today in Jerusalem with tens of thousands of family members and supporters [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=160.38s)]
*  of the people who were abducted. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=166.22s)]
*  And what we're trying to do is to win a war against a terrible terrorist group. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=168.62s)]
*  So we can have our differences about who should run the war, who should be leading the country [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=173.42s)]
*  in a time like this. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  But there are no differences in the goals of this war and what is it that we're trying [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  to do for our country. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=186.01999999999998s)]
*  I think even Benjamin Netanyahu's key adviser and advisor, Mark Regev, agreed with what [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=188.5s)]
*  you probably just said, and that the battle that you're waging is the important one. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  But he did question the timing of you calling for Netanyahu to step down. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=199.02s)]
*  This is from him just earlier in this show, sir. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=204.3s)]
*  We have a parliamentary democracy like in Britain, like in Germany. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=209.3s)]
*  We don't have a presidential system like you have in the US. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=213.10000000000002s)]
*  And the job of the leader of the opposition is to bring down the government. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=215.9s)]
*  That's his constitutional responsibility in our system. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=219.58s)]
*  But I think what is important to remember, what is important to remember is that since [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  this terrible October 7 massacre of our people, you've seen a sense of common purpose and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=226.94s)]
*  unity in Israel like never before. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=232.26s)]
*  And the truth is not Mr. Lapid himself, but other major parties from the opposition have [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=234.78s)]
*  actually joined the government in this emergency wartime coalition because there's a sense [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=239.62s)]
*  that, look, the first thing we've got to do is we've got to defeat Hamas. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=244.62s)]
*  You know, Mr. Lapid, a lot of people can well understand the growing frustration that Israel [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=250.7s)]
*  faces dealing with, you know, Hamas and then the fact that Hamas even seems to be winning [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=255.14s)]
*  the PR war, you know, and that just blows people's minds away. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=261.02s)]
*  But is this part of that, that there's frustration here, that you're feeling frustration? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=265.26s)]
*  Well, I will follow up on what Mark was saying. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=271.34s)]
*  This is a reminder to the fact that Israel is a vibrant and a vital democracy in the [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=277.34s)]
*  Middle, and the only democracy in the Middle East. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=282.58s)]
*  And this is what we do in democracies. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=285.02s)]
*  We discuss things, we have our inner fights, but in the end of the road, what we are doing [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=288.14s)]
*  now we're doing together, which is fighting Hamas, this terrible ISIS-like terror organization, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=294.9s)]
*  and trying to get our babies back home. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=301.58s)]
*  This is the only thing that we really care about. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=304.02s)]
*  How are you holding up? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=307.62s)]
*  How are your colleagues holding up? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=308.74s)]
*  I mean, this has been one of the most remarkable six weeks, forget about just Israeli history [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=310.46s)]
*  and in Western history. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  This is beyond the pale for a lot of folks looking at it from afar. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=320.3s)]
*  Well, this is so nice of you to ask. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=325.58s)]
*  Not great. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=329.62s)]
*  I don't remember myself as sad as this in my entire life. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=331.42s)]
*  I'm the son of a Holocaust survivor, and for the first time since he died 15 years ago, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=337.5s)]
*  I was happy he's not here to see this, because these are Holocaust-like visuals. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=342.86s)]
*  And I mean, today even I had to run twice to the shelter work because we had sirens. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=350.22s)]
*  So these are difficult times to be here, but we are strong and we appreciate the friendship [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=357.74s)]
*  that we feel from the United States. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=364.58s)]
*  It's amazing, this wave. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=366.62s)]
*  You show the protesters, but we are also seeing the size and the amount and the magnitude [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=368.66s)]
*  of the support that Israel is getting these days. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=374.82s)]
*  And this is extremely helpful, both emotionally and practically. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=377.94s)]
*  Mr. Lapid, thank you for taking the time. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=381.34s)]
*  These are very difficult times, I understand, sir, and we appreciate you sharing how you're [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=385.06s)]
*  feeling through all of this. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=390.29999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DGbpd9gxBlQ&t=391.97999999999996s)]
