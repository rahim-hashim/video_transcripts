# Biden administration ‘facilitated’ the ‘enrichment’ of Iran: Victoria Coates
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo)
*  Now, the latest on the Houthi attacks in the Middle East. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=0.0s)]
*  We are joined by Vice President of Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation, Victoria [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=6.08s)]
*  Coats. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=10.8s)]
*  Victoria, thanks so much for joining us today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=11.8s)]
*  It's an important topic. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=14.64s)]
*  I think many people had never heard of the Houthis before this war with Israel began [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=15.64s)]
*  in October. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=20.64s)]
*  This is a very dangerous group. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=22.16s)]
*  They are responsible for kidnapping Americans, raping and mutilating women. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  But you know, in February of 2021, shortly after President Biden took office, he took [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=29.12s)]
*  them off the list of foreign terrorist organizations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=34.6s)]
*  Given what's going on, is it time to redesignate them as a foreign terrorist organization? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=38.04s)]
*  Good to be with you, Anita. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=44.0s)]
*  They never should have been taken off this list. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=45.14s)]
*  The process to put the Houthi on the FTO list, which goes through the State Department and [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=47.68s)]
*  the Treasury Department and Defense, is a legal process. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=52.72s)]
*  You have to establish that they are engaging in certain types of activities. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=56.36s)]
*  It's not just something President Trump or Secretary Pompeo did by a whim. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=60.36s)]
*  They did it because the Houthis were behaving as terrorists. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=64.64s)]
*  And what we've seen out of them for the last two months are 22 attacks, yes, some on U.S. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=67.6s)]
*  and British and French Navy vessels, but also just on commercial shipping. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=74.12s)]
*  That is the definition of terrorism. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=77.92s)]
*  And I just add, the guy that you were just reporting on from New Jersey, who was trying [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=80.1s)]
*  to provide material support for al-Shabaab, if he actually did that for the Houthi who [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=84.52s)]
*  are lobbing ballistic missiles at our warships, he would not face the same consequences because [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=89.32s)]
*  the Biden administration decided to redesignate them. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's just unbelievable. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=98.08s)]
*  And you know, according to our own national security correspondent, Jennifer Griffin, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=101.16s)]
*  the Houthis have attacked over 21 international vessels in the Red Sea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=104.84s)]
*  They are, of course, backed and funded by Iran. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=108.84s)]
*  As I mentioned, they're causing a lot of havoc in the region. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=112.26s)]
*  The U.S. has not responded to these specific attacks in the Red Sea. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=115.2s)]
*  What are your thoughts on that and what can or what should the administration be doing? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=119.62s)]
*  Well, we've been exclusively defensive up till now and we have significant assets. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=124.58000000000001s)]
*  We've got the Eisenhower Carrier Group. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=130.74s)]
*  We've got Arleigh Burke-class destroyers, the Lamboon, for example, the Mason. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=132.5s)]
*  These are incredibly capable vessels for the United States Navy. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=137.86s)]
*  And the good news is that they've been doing yeoman's work, shooting down these various [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=141.70000000000002s)]
*  projectiles. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=145.94s)]
*  Bad news is we've had to do it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=146.74s)]
*  And my concern, Anita, is that when everyone gets back in the office next week, we're going [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=148.82000000000002s)]
*  to start to see the results of half the shipping through the Red Sea and the Suez Canal having [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  to go all the way around Africa. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=158.10000000000002s)]
*  I saw some reporting today that shipping costs to send something from Asia to Europe [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=160.02s)]
*  may triple in coming months. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=165.06s)]
*  All of that is going to hit Americans who are already suffering from our own economic [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=166.9s)]
*  troubles in the wallet, in the pocketbook, because those costs will be passed on to American [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=172.73999999999998s)]
*  consumers. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=178.34s)]
*  And that's why I think the administration needs to be much more aggressive about pushing [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=178.98s)]
*  the Houthi back and making it clear to the Iranians, we're not going to stand for this. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=183.54s)]
*  Yeah, there are going to be real ramifications for everyday Americans, that's for sure. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=188.1s)]
*  You know, just a couple of days ago, the Treasury Department leveled sanctions on an alleged [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=192.58s)]
*  network in Yemen sending Iranian funds to the Houthi rebels. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=197.06s)]
*  These entities have transferred millions of dollars to the Houthis at the direction of [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=201.22s)]
*  Iran. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=205.7s)]
*  Will these sanctions have any effect on their operations? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=206.26s)]
*  No, they won't. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=210.1s)]
*  It's window dressing at best. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=211.94s)]
*  And the administration has facilitated the enrichment of the Iranian regime by acts like [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=213.54s)]
*  de-designating the Houthi, which would have made this more difficult. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=218.5s)]
*  It would have put more sanctions on them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=222.18s)]
*  But then also stopping enforcing the sanctions on Iranian oil exports, primarily to China. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=224.02s)]
*  That has been the billions and billions of dollars that have flowed to Tehran in the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=231.22s)]
*  last three years that have funded things like October 7th that are funding the Houthi. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=236.02s)]
*  That you could crack down on with much more serious action out of the Treasury Department, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=241.46s)]
*  but the administration shows no interest in that. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=246.1s)]
*  Well, one other thing the administration is trying to do is to launch this new [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=248.9s)]
*  multi-nation maritime force called Operation Prosperity Guardian to protect commerce in the [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=253.22s)]
*  Red Sea. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=258.82s)]
*  But so far, two allies, Italy and Spain, have backed out. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=259.62s)]
*  A quick answer here. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=263.38s)]
*  Why do you think that is and what more do you know about that? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=264.74s)]
*  I don't think anyone believes the Americans are going to take decisive action. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=268.5s)]
*  The French don't want to take direction from the Americans because they don't think it's [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=271.7s)]
*  going to actually protect their ships. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=274.82s)]
*  We are projecting weakness, Anita, and it's going to have really, I think, unfortunate [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=276.42s)]
*  consequences going into the new year. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=280.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, it is a dangerous situation and we certainly hope for the best there. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=283.7s)]
*  But thank you so much, Victoria Coats, for your insights today on that and happy New Year to you. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=287.94s)]
*  Happy New Year to you and Greg. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=292.82s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b43jGiqngDo&t=294.90000000000003s)]
