# ‘SAVAGE TERRORISTS’: Attack on Israel is ‘our 9/11,’ says ambassador
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E)
*  We're joined by Gilad Erdon, who serves as Israel's ambassador to the UN, here on the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=0.0s)]
*  couch with us in New York. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=4.88s)]
*  Happy to have you with us this morning. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=6.76s)]
*  Obviously, our thoughts, our prayers with your entire nation. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=8.0s)]
*  What can you tell us this morning is the latest of what's happening in Israel? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=10.98s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=14.94s)]
*  These are devastating days for all Israelis. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=17.04s)]
*  And as you showed your viewers, the numbers are unfathomable. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=21.6s)]
*  I mean, we experienced an unprecedented attack during our Jewish holidays on the Jewish Sabbath. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=26.04s)]
*  I mean, hundreds of Israeli civilians were butchered in the streets. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=35.72s)]
*  Grandparents and the elderly were taken, dragged from their homes into Gaza. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=41.08s)]
*  Mothers with their babies, sometimes only the babies were taken hostage. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=48.96s)]
*  It's really unfathomable, unfathomable. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=55.12s)]
*  And 600, I hope everyone understands, 600 fatalities in Israel proportionally is like [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=58.64s)]
*  having here 20,000 American fatalities, 20,000 people who are being butchered, massacred [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=65.2s)]
*  by these savage terrorists. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=74.44s)]
*  It's our 9-11. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=78.24s)]
*  We should all understand it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=80.28s)]
*  It's our 9-11. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=81.96s)]
*  And from today on, things will never be in Israel as they were. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=83.88s)]
*  But we are strong. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=88.83999999999999s)]
*  We are a resilient people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=90.72s)]
*  We've gone through hardships and we will win also this war. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=92.84s)]
*  We will prevail. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=97.24s)]
*  You know, Ambassador, you just put that into a really interesting perspective. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=98.24s)]
*  So the equivalent of 20,000 Americans, your 9-11, you know, we fought back after our 9-11. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=102.44s)]
*  What do you think when you hear a Democratic congressman in this country, Ilhan Omar, say, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=107.69999999999999s)]
*  you know, it's time for a ceasefire? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=111.88s)]
*  I'm not going to comment directly to Ilhan Omar. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=114.72s)]
*  I said many times in the past what I think about the squad and their anti-Semitic views. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=118.32s)]
*  We're not going to listen to anyone right now. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=124.44s)]
*  We are fighting for our people. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=126.92s)]
*  You know, today we have the Security Council of the UN that will be convened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=129.24s)]
*  We expect everyone, those who support the Democratic values, liberal values, we expect [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=134.72s)]
*  all of them to support Israel, to condemn explicitly Hamas and to say that they support [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=142.48s)]
*  100 percent our right to defend ourselves. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=149.88s)]
*  We don't want any lectures now explaining us how to do it, what means to use. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=153.32s)]
*  We are going to use every means at our disposal because you know what? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=159.68s)]
*  We are fighting exactly like you fought against ISIS or against Al-Qaeda. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=163.88s)]
*  These barbaric terrorists, they have the same ideology. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  Hamas, we should all understand who is Hamas. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=174.04s)]
*  They're not looking to compromise or to have a dialogue with Israel. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=177.12s)]
*  They only want to annihilate the one and only Jewish state. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=181.48s)]
*  Their charter says it's loud and clear, you should butcher every Jew that you meet. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  And that's what they did on the Jewish holiday. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=190.6s)]
*  They butchered, like during the Holocaust, you know, hundreds of kids, babies. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=194.64s)]
*  Our daughters are missing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=201.6s)]
*  There are so many people who are still missing. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  And we are now, you know, we are committed now to prevent these atrocities from happening [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=206.72s)]
*  again and we will do it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=213.79999999999998s)]
*  Do you believe you'll get that support from both the current administration in the United [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=215.56s)]
*  States and the UN? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=220.56s)]
*  When you look at the UN, the amount of resolutions they passed that focus on Israel, condemning [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=222.44s)]
*  Israel, do you really believe they'll coalesce at this moment? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=227.12s)]
*  Will you have the space necessary to get the retribution that Israel needs? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=230.56s)]
*  Look, I'm not naive and I have been serving and representing Israel at the UN for the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  last three years. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=241.32s)]
*  I know all the moral distortions of the UN and the automatic majority against Israel. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=242.6s)]
*  But today we expect everyone and first and foremost, you know, the free world, the democratic [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=248.67999999999998s)]
*  world, Israel is at the forefront of fighting terrorism, of fighting radicalism. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=254.16s)]
*  We can all see the terrible pictures coming from Israel every day. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=259.64s)]
*  So I'm not naive, but I hope that this time they will all understand what needs to be [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=266.64s)]
*  done. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  This is full support, full backing to the state of Israel in our fight against terrorism, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=273.6s)]
*  exactly as we were all united to back and support the free world, the democratic world [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  when we all needed to eliminate ISIS because we realized they want to annihilate us, our [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  way of living, our values. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=293.36s)]
*  That's what we are facing now in Israel coming from Gaza. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=295.64000000000004s)]
*  So you'll be asking for full support for what needs to be done, in your words. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=299.24s)]
*  So what does need to be done? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  It's a very tough and hard question because obviously I cannot share our military's plan [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=305.6s)]
*  on TV. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=311.88000000000005s)]
*  We don't want them to be prepared. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=312.88000000000005s)]
*  But as you said, and I believe everyone understands that we don't want to hear these calls to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=316.24s)]
*  restraint for restraint, for calm of both sides. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=325.16s)]
*  We keep hearing these. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=329.32000000000005s)]
*  It's coming basically from the UN and the UN's leadership, these immoral equations [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=331.68s)]
*  between the barbaric terrorists, those who attacked us and Israel, the democratic, the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=337.96s)]
*  only liberal democracy in the Middle East that is defending its civilians from these [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=346.56s)]
*  barbaric terrorists. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=353.0s)]
*  We don't want to hear these calls. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=354.4s)]
*  We're not going to listen to them. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=355.88s)]
*  We are going to use every means at our disposal in order to obliterate, fully obliterate the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=357.64s)]
*  terrorist infrastructure of Hamas. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=365.24s)]
*  And this time it must happen because it's about our existence. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=367.52s)]
*  It's about our future, our future as the one and only Jewish state in the world, in the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=371.28s)]
*  Middle East, surrounded by enemies. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=376.15999999999997s)]
*  Ambassador, it's unfathomable. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=378.91999999999996s)]
*  The administration I worked for, the Trump administration, you were there on that beautiful [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=380.56s)]
*  sunny day, September 15th, 2020, when we had peace accords coming since 1996, first [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=383.88s)]
*  time since 1996. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=389.48s)]
*  And now here we are September of 2023, a much different story. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=My26DYm9K9E&t=391.28s)]
