# Karoline Leavitt calls out CNN, Democrats: 'BLATANT LIE' #short #usa #politics #iran #foxnews #world
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg)
*  First of all, we did make bipartisan calls. Thomas Massie and the Democrats, he should [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=0.0s)]
*  be a Democrat, because he's more aligned with them than with the Republican Party, were [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=4.84s)]
*  given notice. The White House made calls to congressional leadership. They were bipartisan [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=10.48s)]
*  calls. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=15.64s)]
*  In fact, Takim Drafres couldn't be reached. We tried him before the strike, and he didn't [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=16.64s)]
*  pick up the phone, but he was briefed after, as well as Chuck Schumer was briefed prior [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=19.68s)]
*  to the strike. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=23.72s)]
*  So, this notion that CNN ran with, that the White House did not give a heads-up to Democrats, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=24.72s)]
*  is just completely false. In fact, both Senator Schumer's office and CNN had to retract that [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=29.24s)]
*  story last night, because it was a blatant lie, and we showed them the timestamps from [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=34.6s)]
*  those phone calls. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=39.099999999999994s)]
*  But I want to add something to Thomas Massie's false points. The White House was not obligated [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=40.099999999999994s)]
*  to call anyone, because the president was acting within his legal authority under Article [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=45.36s)]
*  2 of the Constitution as commander-in-chief of the president of the United States. We [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=49.599999999999994s)]
*  gave these calls as a courtesy, and the Democrats are lying about this, because they can't talk [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=53.94s)]
*  about the truth of the success of that operation, and the success of our United States military, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  and the success of this president and this administration in doing something that past [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  administrations, Democrats too, have only dreamed about. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-5g3fBFrg&t=67.72s)]
