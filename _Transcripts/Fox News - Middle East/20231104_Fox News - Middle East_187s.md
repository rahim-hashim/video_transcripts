# House Dems defend 'no' vote on resolution condemning antisemitism: 'Lies everywhere'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM)
*  Could I ask you really quickly why couldn't you condemn anti-semitism? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=0.0s)]
*  I did. I do every day. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=4.08s)]
*  Why didn't you vote for the bill that would condemn anti-semitism every day? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=5.2s)]
*  But why wouldn't you vote for the bill? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=8.56s)]
*  Every day I condemn anti-semitism. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=10.64s)]
*  So why not vote for the bill? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=12.16s)]
*  It should be easy. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=13.92s)]
*  I condemn anti-semitism every single day. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=14.88s)]
*  Why not vote for it then? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=16.8s)]
*  Every day. I've condemned it every day. Thank you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=17.84s)]
*  Why can't you condemn anti-semitism on college campuses? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=20.16s)]
*  Oh I do. I'm one of the most vocal people to condemn anti-semitism across. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  Because there's lies in the resolution and right now there's lies everywhere on all sides of this [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=27.92s)]
*  I decided about a week ago voting no on anything that contains lies that it harms both Jewish and [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=32.64s)]
*  an Arab and Muslim students alike and so [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=39.56s)]
*  Very specific instances about Brandeis. I encourage you to look into it [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=42.56s)]
*  Why can't you condemn anti-semitism [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  Are you talking about I've done that a million times [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=52.64s)]
*  Why didn't you vote for the resolution that condemned anti-semitism on college campuses because I didn't agree with the resolution [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=54.84s)]
*  But I've condemned anti-semitism a million times and we're fighting to end [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Anti-semitism in a real way and fighting the end hate in all its forms. Wouldn't it be an easy vote? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=65.16s)]
*  I'd be the resolution basically condemns anti-semitism. I didn't agree with the resolution [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=69.6s)]
*  I didn't think it did enough to move the conversation forward, but I consistently condemn anti-semitism [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=74.44s)]
*  Why can't you condemn anti-semitism on college campuses? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=80.16s)]
*  You about a ceasefire [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=97.52s)]
*  So if Hamas is holding babies and children hostage if they're hoarding fuel [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=100.44s)]
*  They're continuing to fire rockets at Israel is Israel the problem here or is Hamas the problem? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=105.2s)]
*  I don't think that that is what international humanitarian law looks at what international humanitarian law looks at is [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  How you protect the lives of innocent civilians once conflict has started? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=118.60000000000001s)]
*  Everyone has been clear that Hamas is a terrorist organization. What Hamas did to Israel on October 7th was horrific [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=123.2s)]
*  Israel has the right to defend itself. The question is how [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=130.32s)]
*  Tactically, what is the best way to get Hamas out to eliminate Hamas? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=134.72s)]
*  Which is the goal but also how to follow international humanitarian law [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=138.74s)]
*  Right now in Gaza a child is dying every 10 minutes a child is being murdered every 10 minutes by airstrikes [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=144.0s)]
*  We have had over 3,400 children [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=151.32s)]
*  dead [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=154.04s)]
*  9,000 people have died in Gaza from these airstrikes that is not proportionate [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=155.51999999999998s)]
*  It is not in compliance with international humanitarian law and it will not be successful if the goal is to get security [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=160.48s)]
*  For and self-determination for Israel and Palestine [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Swv4bt2U2RM&t=167.84s)]
