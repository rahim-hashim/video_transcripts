# Nikki Haley reveals US' three priorities for support of Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10)
*  This week, five candidates traded barbs as foreign policy took center stage at a tense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=0.0s)]
*  third Republican presidential debate. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=5.14s)]
*  But while the presidential hopefuls sparred, former President Trump was missing again as [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=7.54s)]
*  the field struggles to find ways to chip into his dominating lead. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=11.64s)]
*  Joining us now from South Carolina's former UN ambassador, former governor and presidential [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=15.66s)]
*  candidate Nikki Haley, who has seen a healthy uptick in her recent polling. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=19.44s)]
*  Welcome back, Ambassador. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=23.26s)]
*  Thanks so much, Shannon. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=24.26s)]
*  I want to start with Israel. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=25.26s)]
*  Obviously, you have a deep foreign policy resume. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=27.26s)]
*  What role do you think that the U.S. should have as an ally right now? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=30.580000000000002s)]
*  You heard some of the comments from Senator Warner, chair of the Intel Committee. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=34.74s)]
*  But there are critics with our own diplomatic corps who echo what he has said, that they're [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  worried about us losing the Arab world, Israel losing the Arab world, with the current strategy [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=42.66s)]
*  and possibly the next generation that would be necessary for solving some of these problems [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=48.0s)]
*  long term. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=52.5s)]
*  Our solution should be this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=55.58s)]
*  I mean, we should have three priorities, one, to help Israel eliminate Hamas, two, support [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=56.98s)]
*  Israel with everything they need, no questions asked, and three, to make sure we do everything [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=63.54s)]
*  we can to bring the hostages home. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=68.98s)]
*  This is a tough situation. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=71.22s)]
*  But this is not just an Israel issue. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=72.94s)]
*  This is an American issue. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=75.16s)]
*  Thirty-three Americans were murdered. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=76.7s)]
*  They have American hostages right now. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=78.66s)]
*  Israel is the tip of the spear when it comes to terrorism. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=81.38s)]
*  And we have to remember, Iran is the number one state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=84.38s)]
*  And when they say death to Israel, they say death to America. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=88.53999999999999s)]
*  This war affects us as well. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=91.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, you heard Senator Warner also saying that he thinks a number of you on the debate [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=92.94s)]
*  stage were ready to go to war with Iran or do exact strikes on their actual soil, something [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=96.58s)]
*  a lot of people think would lead to a much broader regional war, if not something worse, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=102.86s)]
*  like World War III. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=106.34s)]
*  What do you say to those who, you know, I saw the headlines this week, the Republicans [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=107.82s)]
*  seem very interested in going to war with this, with Iran? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=111.62s)]
*  It's quite the contrary. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=116.22s)]
*  An American, a strong America doesn't start wars. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=117.82000000000001s)]
*  A strong America prevents wars. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=120.7s)]
*  What we're trying to do is prevent further war. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=122.26s)]
*  And I dealt with Iran every day at the United Nations. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  What they do is they lie, they exaggerate, and every dollar they get goes to terrorism. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=127.94s)]
*  The focus we need to have is right now you've had almost 100 strikes on our men and women [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=133.18s)]
*  in the military in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=138.26s)]
*  That's unforgivable. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=140.78s)]
*  My husband's at one of those bases around the world. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=142.33999999999997s)]
*  We don't ever want them in any harm whatsoever. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=145.26s)]
*  But the thing is, you don't play the tit for tat with Iran. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=149.66s)]
*  What you do instead is, when they do this, you go right at the heart of their infrastructure. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=152.57999999999998s)]
*  You hit their ability to go and even hurt an American soldier. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=158.06s)]
*  If that doesn't work with Iran, if that, yes, you take out their infrastructure. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=162.14s)]
*  If that doesn't work, then you go after the leadership in the IRGC and make sure you go [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=167.74s)]
*  after the leadership in Iran. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=173.26s)]
*  Remember, when we hit Soleimani, it flat-footed Iran. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=174.74s)]
*  They respond to strength. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=178.98s)]
*  Iran has always backed off when they realize America is serious. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=180.98s)]
*  And so us having the backs of Israel is hugely important. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=185.0s)]
*  Us having the back of Ukraine is important because you've got an unholy alliance of China, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=188.54s)]
*  Iran, all trying to intimidate us and intimidate our friends. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=193.78s)]
*  Don't fall for it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=198.7s)]
*  The one thing that all of them fear is when we have an alliance that's strong and that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=199.7s)]
*  we stand by. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=204.1s)]
*  There are a lot of growing questions about whether the U.S. and its military specifically [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=205.7s)]
*  can be stretched in all of these different directions with all of these different potential [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=209.5s)]
*  conflicts. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=213.14s)]
*  The New York Times raises questions. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=214.14s)]
*  We continue to hear about weapons inventory, not only for ourselves but our allies and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=215.34s)]
*  those we're trying to help. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=221.5s)]
*  And as we say this, guided munitions and more complex American systems are being funneled [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=222.5s)]
*  to both the Israel and Ukraine conflicts, even as American partners in the Indo-Pacific [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=225.86s)]
*  wait for weapons deliveries of their own. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=230.78s)]
*  The Center for Strategic and International Studies warns that we are so low on some munitions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=233.66s)]
*  and missiles, it would take years for us to get back and replenish those. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=238.38s)]
*  So what would it take for you as president to rebuild our weapons base, to get those [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=243.0s)]
*  like Taiwan who are waiting on them, and more broadly to get us out of these foreign conflicts? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=249.32s)]
*  The number one job of a president is to protect Americans. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=256.2s)]
*  And keep in mind that any of the resources that are spent on Ukraine and Israel is typically [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=259.2s)]
*  we're giving them the older ammunition, we're giving them our older equipment, and so we're [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=264.38s)]
*  replenishing it with new. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=268.84s)]
*  That's a good thing. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=270.56s)]
*  But we also want to look and see what our stockpiles look like. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=271.56s)]
*  Where are we low? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=274.44s)]
*  What are we going to need going forward? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=275.44s)]
*  And focus more on that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=277.12s)]
*  Keep in mind that the amount of money being spent on Israel and Ukraine is less than 5 [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=278.47999999999996s)]
*  percent of our defense budget. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=283.35999999999996s)]
*  So this is about priorities. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=285.76s)]
*  We need to, one, secure the border. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=287.46s)]
*  We need to make sure we have the backs of Ukraine, and we need to have the backs of [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=289.5s)]
*  Israel. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  But focus on who's supporting who. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=294.4s)]
*  It is interesting that the Taiwanese, they want the West to help Ukraine. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=296.91999999999996s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=300.84s)]
*  Because they know if Ukraine wins, then China won't invade Taiwan, and we won't have to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=301.84s)]
*  deal with that. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=306.28s)]
*  There's a reason that, you know, the Ukrainians want us supporting Israel. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=307.28s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=311.52s)]
*  Because they know if Iran wins, Russia wins, and they don't want to do that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=312.52s)]
*  Everybody else sees this unholy alliance, except for Americans. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  Americans have their head in the sand. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=320.64s)]
*  If we do this right in Ukraine and Israel, we won't have to deal with China. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=322.26s)]
*  China's watching every bit of it, and they fear America that stands by her friends. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=327.11999999999995s)]
*  Well, Americans, the polling shows are growing weary of all of these different incursions [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=332.96s)]
*  around the world that we're being drawn into, and they are looking, in many cases, according [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=336.4s)]
*  to the polling, to a commander in chief who would pull them out of many of those. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=340.12s)]
*  And I know that that's just part of the argument about the 2024 field. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=343.35999999999996s)]
*  I want to get to that because the New York Times had a piece about you actually had some [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=346.32s)]
*  nice things to say, which you might find surprising, but they had a long list of things they say [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=349.2s)]
*  have to happen if you're to win the nomination, the GOP nomination. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=353.06s)]
*  We're going to scroll those on the screen. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=356.88s)]
*  I'll just read a few of them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=357.88s)]
*  You need more money for TV ads. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=359.28s)]
*  Candidates have to give up on other candidates. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=360.8s)]
*  Candidates have to drop out for New Hampshire. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=362.72s)]
*  You have to flip people. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=364.56s)]
*  It goes on and on and on. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=365.56s)]
*  It's sort of in the vein of saying, so you're saying there's a chance. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=367.36s)]
*  If all these things don't align for you, how long will you stay in and fight? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=371.84000000000003s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=377.32s)]
*  We are surging in the polls. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=378.44s)]
*  Not only are we surging in the polls, if you look in the swing states, it shows that we [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=380.24s)]
*  beat Biden by 10 to 13 points. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  We are now second place in Iowa, second place in New Hampshire, second place in South Carolina. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=386.6s)]
*  There are no other candidates are going to be getting in the race because now it's gotten [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=392.28000000000003s)]
*  too late. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=395.48s)]
*  We have plenty of money that we're going to be on TV with, and you're going to see that [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=396.48s)]
*  we're going to be strong, not just in Iowa. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=399.52s)]
*  We're going to be strong in Iowa. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=401.76s)]
*  We're going to be strong in New Hampshire. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=402.96s)]
*  We're going to be strong in South Carolina because we spent our money well. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=403.96s)]
*  We've got great ground games in every one of those states, and we're going to keep surging. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=407.84000000000003s)]
*  You've got Trump that's flatlined. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=412.7s)]
*  You've got DeSantis that's falling in the polls, and we continue to go up. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=414.2s)]
*  We've had a great last debate. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=417.56s)]
*  We raised a million dollars in 24 hours past the debate, and we're going to go work hard [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=421.84s)]
*  to earn every Iowan, every Granite stater, and every South Carolinian's vote because [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=427.08s)]
*  we have a country to save. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=432.36s)]
*  Let's talk about a little bit of the realities, though. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=433.64s)]
*  President Trump is up 30 to 40 points in most polls out there on the entire rest of the [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=435.91999999999996s)]
*  field. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=439.48s)]
*  Senator DeSantis picked up Governor Reynolds, a much coveted endorsement in Iowa along [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=440.48s)]
*  with a number of other leaders there. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=444.40000000000003s)]
*  He now has the highest favorables in the GOP field in Iowa, including President Trump. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=445.56s)]
*  And then this headline from The Hill yesterday, it says Trump's massive lead in polls deals [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=450.32s)]
*  blow to the rivals' electability case. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=454.40000000000003s)]
*  They talk about polls from New York Times, CNN, CBS News, Emerson, all showing President [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=457.54s)]
*  Trump leading President Biden in a head-to-head matchup. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=461.62s)]
*  You do better in those polls, but how do you convince primary voters to abandon somebody [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=465.0s)]
*  who is up by 30, 40 points when this argument about him being able to beat President Biden [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=469.48s)]
*  is in many of these polls being muted? [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=474.0s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, you know, I think certainly Trump has some strong support. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=476.48s)]
*  I've always said he was the right president at the right time, and I agree with a lot [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=482.6s)]
*  of his policies. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=485.84s)]
*  The problem is drama and chaos follow him, whether fairly or not. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=487.22s)]
*  It is constantly following him, and Americans feel for it, feel it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=492.18s)]
*  And so I think you can look at that with our elections over and over again. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=495.7s)]
*  We pay the price for it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=498.74s)]
*  And I think what's really important is we need to have someone who can win the general [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=500.18s)]
*  election as well. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=504.9s)]
*  We need to make sure that we have a new conservative leader. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=506.09999999999997s)]
*  Republicans have lost the last seven out of eight popular votes for president. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=508.74s)]
*  The way you do that is you send someone in there that doesn't just beat Biden by two or [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=512.66s)]
*  three points like Trump does. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=516.8199999999999s)]
*  You get somebody that beats Biden between nine and 13 points. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=518.5s)]
*  That way we win up and down the ticket, governor's races, congressional seats, all of those [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=521.9399999999999s)]
*  seats. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=527.18s)]
*  And what we're trying to do is not just win the presidential. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=528.66s)]
*  We want to win across the board. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=530.66s)]
*  I can do that. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=532.0999999999999s)]
*  And that's the focus that we have. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=533.18s)]
*  And I'll tell you that I think people are getting tired of the drama and the chaos and [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=534.62s)]
*  the negativity. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=538.54s)]
*  They see the wars happening around that they want to prevent and put an end to. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=539.66s)]
*  They see inflation that they can't afford. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=544.1999999999999s)]
*  They see a border that's open. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=546.3599999999999s)]
*  They see crime on the rise. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=547.9799999999999s)]
*  And they see that our kids are suffering terribly and reading and math. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=549.7399999999999s)]
*  And we've got to get that right. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=552.78s)]
*  We are going to start to make America strong and proud again. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=554.52s)]
*  And we're going to finish this, but we need everybody to go to NikkiHaley.com and join us. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=557.54s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=561.04s)]
*  We will follow along. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=562.04s)]
*  See you on the campaign trail. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=563.04s)]
*  And Ambassador, always our thanks to your husband Michael, who is in uniform with tens [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=564.04s)]
*  of thousands of other Americans around the globe. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=567.72s)]
*  Thank you both for his service. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=569.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=572.36s)]
*  God bless them all. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k0SXyT6fX10&t=573.36s)]
