# Two rockets hit Baghdad's Green Zone near US Embassy: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04)
*  All right, want to keep advancing and updating on this story that warning sirens heard in [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=0.0s)]
*  and around Baghdad. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=5.48s)]
*  Dre is there with the very latest. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=6.68s)]
*  Hey Dre. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=9.0s)]
*  Hey there, Neil. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=10.0s)]
*  We've got some updates for you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=11.56s)]
*  We've confirmed that two rockets did land in Baghdad's green zone, exploding in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=14.08s)]
*  perimeter of the U.S. embassy but not actually striking the compound. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=18.96s)]
*  According to officials that we spoke with, one of the rockets landed near the Tigris [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=22.56s)]
*  River. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=26.28s)]
*  The other one hitting a building that is under construction. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=27.48s)]
*  No casualties are being reported, but these officials say they believe they are Qatusha [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=30.8s)]
*  rockets likely fired by Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia militias that are operating near Baghdad. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  This is not the first time this week that this has happened. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=40.84s)]
*  Earlier in the week, we also saw five rockets landing in Baghdad's green zone. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=43.6s)]
*  But tonight we did hear that one large explosion and then the sirens blaring, incoming, incoming, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=48.2s)]
*  incoming, indicating that there was an attack towards the green zone. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  All of this though painting a larger picture about what the region may deal with as the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=56.72s)]
*  proxy issue does continue. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=60.36s)]
*  It's important to differentiate for our viewers though the difference between the rockets [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=62.96s)]
*  that we saw tonight and the rockets that we saw last night. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=65.96s)]
*  Last night there were ballistic missiles fired from Iran, 15 of them into Iraqi territory. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=69.08s)]
*  The rockets that we saw fired tonight, they're not missiles, they're rockets. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=73.88s)]
*  They're fired by militia groups. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=76.84s)]
*  It's a much smaller type of attack, but still an attack nonetheless that could threaten [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=78.74s)]
*  forces or personnel that are operating in Baghdad and the surrounding region. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=83.58s)]
*  Neil? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=87.06s)]
*  Trey, do we know what the Iranians have indicated or at best you can get from them that this [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=88.06s)]
*  is it, that this, what they did last night was it for the time being? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=94.7s)]
*  What we saw last night appeared to be finished for now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=103.1s)]
*  The large response by the Iranians avenging the death of their top general, Soleimani, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=107.42s)]
*  Qasem Soleimani, that was, he was killed outside of Baghdad's international airport last week [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=112.22s)]
*  after the president made that decision to order a drone strike. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=116.82s)]
*  But the issue here when it comes to the militia operating the area is they do receive direction [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=120.74s)]
*  and funding from the Iranian regime. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=125.0s)]
*  Whether it serves them politically or not, sometimes you'll see Iran's supreme leader, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=127.53999999999999s)]
*  Ayatollah Khamenei, or you'll hear the president of Iran, Hassan Rouhani, say that they can [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=131.5s)]
*  or they can't control the actions of these militias operating in Iraq. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  But the reality on the ground is that most of what happens here is somehow linked to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=140.45999999999998s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=144.7s)]
*  So it's important to remember that in the larger picture. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=145.7s)]
*  Thank you, my friend, very much. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=147.57999999999998s)]
*  Be safe. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=148.57999999999998s)]
*  Trey Yanks in Baghdad. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AQIVhT6pZ04&t=149.57999999999998s)]
