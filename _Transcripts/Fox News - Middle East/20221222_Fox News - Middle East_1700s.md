# Nancy Pelosi holds likely final press briefing as House speaker
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 22, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE)
*  get to that in a moment, but first I want to talk about last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=0.0s)]
*  Last night was so historic for us to hear President Zelensky. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=3.6s)]
*  It's been a momentous week for our democracy. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=9.52s)]
*  Yesterday was our high, my high honor to welcome President Zelensky of Ukraine [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=12.68s)]
*  here in the United States Capitol. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=18.56s)]
*  He delivered a magnificent, awe inspiring speech. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  I think all would agree. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  And the courage, heroism and determination of the Ukrainian people shown through. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=26.12s)]
*  It was moving to hear his report on the front lines of war from what he had just [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=31.92s)]
*  come from the front lines, sharing with us the valor by citizen and soldier alike. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=35.88s)]
*  He always said that people were on the forefront of this and the soldiers came [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=42.08s)]
*  to reinforce that and declaring that at all odds, Ukraine still stood. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=48.24s)]
*  I brought this picture because it's one that I, it's one that I show on Winston [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=54.16s)]
*  Churchill's birthday. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=61.44s)]
*  We have his birthday party every year, just a couple of weeks ago. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=62.36s)]
*  We had it in the Rayburn room. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=67.24s)]
*  Perhaps some of you were there. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=69.24s)]
*  And I always show them the picture of Winston Churchill speaking to the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=71.24s)]
*  Congress of the United States the day after Christmas, 1941, following Pearl Harbor. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=75.24s)]
*  And my father, Thomas Delasandro Jr. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=82.96s)]
*  Baltimore was there. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=85.72s)]
*  And so it always was a source of pride to me that my father was there that day. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=91.64s)]
*  And now a source of pride that I could be there to hear another, another heroic [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=97.52s)]
*  leader of a war, a country at war come ask for help. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=104.76s)]
*  When Winston Churchill came, what he said, now think of this and think of last night, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=109.28s)]
*  he said, we are doing the noblest task in the world, not only defending our hearts [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=114.68s)]
*  and homes, but the cause of freedom in every land. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=121.4s)]
*  So much the theme, so much the common purpose of President Zelensky. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=126.44s)]
*  But I'm so proud of this. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=134.24s)]
*  And when I wrote to the members about coming, I said, I take great pride in my [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=135.6s)]
*  fact that my father was there for that. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=140.04s)]
*  I hope that your children will take pride in the fact that you will be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=142.84s)]
*  present for President Zelensky. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=146.2s)]
*  So I was very proud of the turnout that we had, even though it was a last minute [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=147.92s)]
*  notice, because we could not notice unless we knew for sure the president was coming. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=154.68s)]
*  Depending on what was happening in Ukraine, depending on weather and the rest. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=161.44s)]
*  Again, democracy on the line. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=166.0s)]
*  What an honor it was to have a flag that was presented to President Zelensky by the [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  troops, by the troops. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=175.44s)]
*  And he, and they asked him to bring it to us to say, thank you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't have it here, but we're going to having it framed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=185.0s)]
*  So you'll see it in the halls of Congress for a long time to come, but thanking the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=187.6s)]
*  Congress of the United States and the American people for their support signed [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=192.6s)]
*  by the soldiers. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=200.64s)]
*  Of course, they thank the president of the United States. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=202.56s)]
*  And we're very proud of his leadership in all of this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  We gave him a flag and he said, I'm bringing you a flag. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  I said, well, I'm bringing you a flag. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=214.12s)]
*  And so we gave him a flag and the latest manifestation of the unshakable [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  relationship between our two countries. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=220.44000000000003s)]
*  This week was also marked by a focus on democracy here at home. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=224.8s)]
*  Today, the world will see the final report of the Bipartisan Select Committee to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=228.28s)]
*  investigate January 6th after eight month, 18 months of tirelessly defending [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=232.96s)]
*  democracy. We salute Chairman, Chairman Thompson. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=240.56s)]
*  I just did in the caucus and vice chair Liz Cheney and all the members of the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  committee for their persistent patriotic leadership. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=248.8s)]
*  One hundred and seventeen Congress began with a violent assault on our democracy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=253.44s)]
*  And now we hear its conclusions. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=259.36s)]
*  We have a vital road map in ensuring justice will be done and keep and that this [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=261.44s)]
*  won't happen again. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=267.40000000000003s)]
*  And keeping with our special focus of the week, this excellent work, this is this [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  is an enormous undertaking. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=275.52s)]
*  The omnibus package takes strong steps to defend democracy, including [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=277.59999999999997s)]
*  legislation, another round of security, economic and humanitarian aid for Ukraine. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=283.44s)]
*  As President Zelensky said last night, this money is not charity. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=290.64s)]
*  It is an investment in global security and democracy. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=294.64s)]
*  Indeed, it is a worthwhile investment and our bipartisan, bicameral support must [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=298.79999999999995s)]
*  continue because the battle for Ukraine is a battle for democracy itself. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=303.92s)]
*  Also in the omnibus, and this is pretty exciting for all of us, we're addressing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=311.04s)]
*  some of the vulnerabilities in the January 6th attack by reforming the Electoral [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=319.24s)]
*  Count Act, who will thwart future attempts to undermine the peaceful transfer of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=324.12s)]
*  power. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=330.16s)]
*  And thanks to Democrats, numerous negotiating, the negotiating on this, you [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=334.0s)]
*  know, the bill is the Appropriations Bill. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=338.8s)]
*  And that is what keeps government open and meets the needs of the American people [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=341.76s)]
*  in the Appropriations Committee. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=348.08000000000004s)]
*  Probably bigger than that are the provisions in the bill. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=352.36s)]
*  We call it ash and trash, just as a, and that does remarkable things. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=356.24s)]
*  And we had tremendous success with that. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=362.59999999999997s)]
*  In fact, the highest in terms of appropriations, the highest domestic, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=365.4s)]
*  non-defense domestic number ever. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=371.4s)]
*  We always want more, but nonetheless. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=373.91999999999996s)]
*  And again, thanks to the tenacious negotiating, Rosa DeLauro was a maestro. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=377.28s)]
*  It is a maestro. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=381.88s)]
*  I mean, just tough negotiator, but a maestro, with a baton and a stick. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=383.12s)]
*  We've secured significant increase, heavily invested in families and workers, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=390.92s)]
*  honor the commitment to our veterans and strengthen democracy at home and abroad. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=395.8s)]
*  Most people don't know that veterans fall under the domestic agenda. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=401.12s)]
*  It is a consequence of war. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=406.76s)]
*  It is a part of our security, but it is not included in the defense budget. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=408.32s)]
*  So when we're fighting for a bigger defense number, it is also to accommodate [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=413.92s)]
*  meeting the needs of our veterans. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=418.8s)]
*  And we want to honor them every chance we get. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=421.04s)]
*  And this year, the PAC to act with something historic and needs to be funded. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=423.84s)]
*  That will take some more time, but we do have funding in this bill for it to. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=431.4s)]
*  So I hope the Senate will swiftly pass this package. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=436.92s)]
*  Again, my delay related to how we see what will happen there on certain amendments. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=440.36s)]
*  When we would get the bill, how much time it takes once it's passed to come over here. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=447.52s)]
*  I know you're interested in schedule, so that's why I'm getting more specific in the details there. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=453.16s)]
*  Our hope would be that if it was finished this afternoon, it takes us about five hours to get the bill. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=458.72s)]
*  We go to rules. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=466.52s)]
*  We could pass it tonight. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=468.04s)]
*  That would be our hope. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=470.4s)]
*  But we're, shall we say, waiting to see how long the debate goes there. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=472.35999999999996s)]
*  We want people to be able to go home. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=479.44s)]
*  And as you know, there's storms across America, and hopefully that will be a motivation for. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=481.44s)]
*  Expedited discussion there or just submitting for the record or saving it for another day or whatever. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=489.64s)]
*  As you know, this is my this I thought last week might have been, but this is my final weekly press conference. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=497.6s)]
*  And some of you have been covering Congress for a long time. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=503.6s)]
*  Others are new. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=506.20000000000005s)]
*  All of you are guardians of democracy. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=507.84000000000003s)]
*  You've heard me say again and again, if there were one freedom in the First Amendment, the freedom of of the press, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=511.16s)]
*  that would be the one that protects and defends all the other freedoms. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=518.24s)]
*  Our founders knew that freedom of the press is foundational to government of, by and for the people, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=522.9200000000001s)]
*  informing the public about the work done in their name, in this case here. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=528.4s)]
*  You know, as I admire your public service, I always enjoy our conversation. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=534.52s)]
*  Turn to San Francisco sports. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=540.6s)]
*  49ers, yellow, warriors, orange, giants. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=544.9200000000001s)]
*  I wish you and all of your loved ones a happy holiday and your last questions. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=550.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, it takes a number of hours. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=566.4s)]
*  It is to get to the House. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=568.4399999999999s)]
*  So you that'll be until we have the bill and we cannot signal a rules committee. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=571.88s)]
*  The rules committee needs an hour's notice and then we hope that it would not be a long rules meeting. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=579.8s)]
*  Hopefully we could get expedited procedure in that hour of notice and that we could just move this even more quickly. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=587.16s)]
*  When you do the bill, just so you know this, because I'm an appropriator and I take great pride in the work of appropriators. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=597.4399999999999s)]
*  After you have the bill, so we have a bill, okay, now they may amend it and we'll see what happens. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=603.32s)]
*  But when you have the bill, you sit side by side and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  read everything in it so that it is what is being written in the parchment is exactly what is the bill. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=617.88s)]
*  That takes a long time for thousands of pages. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=628.72s)]
*  Then when that was finished and we get the signal from the Senate that they want us to send the bill. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=632.44s)]
*  You go to the Senate floor and it's a beautiful thing. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=642.72s)]
*  You go over to the Senate and you take section by section by section by section, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=646.5600000000001s)]
*  House and Senate, not as long as reading every word, but confirming the sections. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=652.96s)]
*  What is that called? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=658.76s)]
*  Has a name, but it is part of the process. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=660.0s)]
*  So all that is done now, it's just a question of the amendments. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=664.88s)]
*  You know what many of them are. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=668.52s)]
*  Probably 15, maybe four to six have a chance to be passed. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=670.16s)]
*  Other compromises made and just a question of how long people decide to talk on the floor. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=676.8s)]
*  We would hope that with this smaller amount of amendments, it would come over sooner. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=685.9599999999999s)]
*  Be closest to what we sent over. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=691.88s)]
*  So again, in terms of your planes, I think it's tomorrow. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=696.16s)]
*  But it could be tomorrow morning is what we hope. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=700.64s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=703.56s)]
*  Madam Speaker, thank you for your comments. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=704.0799999999999s)]
*  I just want to ask you in this time of transition, have you had any conversations with Leader McCartney or do you intend to? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=706.24s)]
*  If he prevails as Speaker, what advice would you give him? [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=713.28s)]
*  Well, I don't think anybody needs any advice from anybody. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  You've heard me say even about our own distinguished leadership. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=720.3199999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to be the mother-in-law comes in and say, this is the way my son likes his turkey stuffing, his scrambled eggs, or anything else. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=724.0s)]
*  They have to have their own vitality about it all, and they do. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=732.0799999999999s)]
*  And so as far as he is concerned, yes, we have some. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=737.2800000000001s)]
*  We have had a formal conversations, but we interact. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=743.9200000000001s)]
*  And I'm just hoping that on January 3rd that they'll be expeditiously able to elect a speaker so that we can get on with the work of the Congress. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=747.2800000000001s)]
*  And just so you know, this may interest you. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=761.0400000000001s)]
*  What I have said to everybody is the hardest thing that I had to do since you're asking this question. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=763.76s)]
*  I was Speaker and Minority Leader under President Bush, under President Obama, under what's his name? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=773.2s)]
*  And there's just Speaker under President Biden. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  But three different presidents, two different roles. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=789.36s)]
*  The hardest thing that I had to do in all of the say, let's just talk about the three. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=795.36s)]
*  The hardest thing that I had to do, and I said this in friendship and in love and all the rest of that is. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=802.4s)]
*  When we had a Democratic president and we were in the majority minority and we were in the minority as minority leader to sustain a presidential veto. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=810.5600000000001s)]
*  Because the Republicans would roll out stuff that sounded like a chocolate sundae, but it's more like doggy do. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=822.4s)]
*  But it looked good and played well in districts and people say, oh, this is good. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=831.6800000000001s)]
*  No, it ain't good. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=837.12s)]
*  It's terrible and undermines the Affordable Care Act. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=838.9599999999999s)]
*  We have to sustain the presidential veto. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=842.64s)]
*  This is not a casual vote. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=845.52s)]
*  This is not a casual vote. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=848.48s)]
*  So I'd rather be writing the Affordable Care Act or any other massive legislation than to have to go to my members and say. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=850.56s)]
*  My friend in friendship. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=861.92s)]
*  I really need your vote to sustain the president's speech. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=864.56s)]
*  That was that was the hardest. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=871.1199999999999s)]
*  I appreciate that question as well. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=886.8s)]
*  I am I came to Congress. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=888.72s)]
*  There were 23 women, 13 Democrats, no, 12 Democrats and 11 Republicans out of 435 people. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=891.28s)]
*  There were 23 over 400 men and 23 women. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=902.4s)]
*  Come on, you know, get out of here. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=908.8000000000001s)]
*  So some of us just made a decision. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=910.5600000000001s)]
*  We have to change this. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=914.24s)]
*  We have to recruit. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=916.08s)]
*  We have to fund. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=917.84s)]
*  We have to encourage women to run. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=918.8000000000001s)]
*  Give confidence to them that not only are they should they be here, they are needed to be here. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=922.32s)]
*  And we now have 90 Democrats. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=929.76s)]
*  They have 30, you think something Republicans and they've made some progress lately. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=932.32s)]
*  And that's good. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=936.32s)]
*  But we need more and we need more people of color and the rest. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=937.2s)]
*  And I take great pride that our caucus is about 70 percent women. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=942.4000000000001s)]
*  People of color, LGBTQ, the beautiful diversity of America in terms of women, though, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=947.5999999999999s)]
*  they're always asking me. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=954.8s)]
*  And that's I get it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=955.8399999999999s)]
*  Ask them. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=956.8s)]
*  What advice do you have? [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=958.56s)]
*  I say the best advice I ever had that I extend to you is be yourself. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=960.64s)]
*  You're the only person in the history of the world who is you. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=967.12s)]
*  What you have is authentic, is special, is unique, and that diversity is necessary at the table. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=971.5999999999999s)]
*  Also, I want women to have confidence. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=982.24s)]
*  So sometimes when I act a little more, shall we say, like myself, it's because I want them to know [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=984.4799999999999s)]
*  it's OK to assert yourself, to have confidence in what you bring to the table. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=994.4799999999999s)]
*  And also to understand your uniqueness. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1000.2399999999999s)]
*  So I get overwhelmed by women telling me how I've given them confidence or role model and this. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1004.0s)]
*  And I said, don't worry about any role model. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1013.68s)]
*  Be yourself. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1016.4799999999999s)]
*  Seems appropriate that Chad would have one of the last questions. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1020.3199999999999s)]
*  If you don't think it's appropriate, we don't have to have it. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1024.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1030.16s)]
*  Considering the consternation on the Republican side of the aisle picking a speaker as somebody [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1033.6000000000001s)]
*  who has been speaker and has been through speaker's races before, does that bother you about what [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1038.5600000000002s)]
*  that says about the stability of the out of representatives if they're having trouble [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1044.0800000000002s)]
*  picking a speaker? [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1048.0s)]
*  No. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1048.72s)]
*  And might you be the last speaker for a while until they pick a speaker? [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1051.2s)]
*  No, I think they'll have a speaker. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1056.48s)]
*  I think that my interest and all of us have been instilled into the integrity of the institution, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1058.16s)]
*  the strength and respect that the institution commands and should command. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1065.12s)]
*  And so that's why I said I hope that they would be able to resolve their differences [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1070.32s)]
*  on January 3rd and just come through with a vote to proceed. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1074.96s)]
*  It doesn't weaken the House if it takes a while. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1081.28s)]
*  It doesn't weaken the House if it takes a few days. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1083.28s)]
*  No, no. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1085.2s)]
*  We're a democratic institution. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  No, I wouldn't read too much into that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1088.24s)]
*  But I do think it's the sooner the better because we have important work to do. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  Whether we agree or disagree, we have important work to do. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1098.88s)]
*  Madam Speaker. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1102.24s)]
*  Madam Speaker. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1103.28s)]
*  Madam Speaker. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1103.76s)]
*  Ukraine and democracy. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1104.24s)]
*  Yes, please. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1105.76s)]
*  Going back to Ukraine and democracy, what message does that send to our biggest adversary [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1106.88s)]
*  on the other side of the globe? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1112.8s)]
*  What happened yesterday, the events of yesterday? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1114.48s)]
*  And what message on the flip side does it send to our allies like Taiwan when our appropriators [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1117.28s)]
*  have pulled billions of dollars that was in the NDAA for military defense out of the [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1125.12s)]
*  ominous appropriations bill? [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1131.52s)]
*  Well, the out of the appropriations bill? [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1133.2s)]
*  Out of it. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1135.68s)]
*  It was not included in the appropriations bill. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1136.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, the defense number is bigger than it's ever been. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1137.76s)]
*  But specifically for Taiwan, about 10 billion grand money is pulled out of the appropriations. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1141.04s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1147.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm not exactly familiar with that piece, but our commitment to Taiwan is a clear one [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1148.8s)]
*  in terms of our support for them to be able to defend themselves. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1154.56s)]
*  But to base a first part of your question, the important purpose in my view of last night [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1160.64s)]
*  and that's why I'm glad the president spoke in English, was to deliver a message to the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1170.48s)]
*  American people of appreciation, of gratitude, and of connection in terms of being about [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1174.8799999999999s)]
*  democracy, theirs and ours. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1183.52s)]
*  So it was an important message for our country. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1186.48s)]
*  The response that he received from the members of Congress was overwhelming. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1189.76s)]
*  It was overwhelming. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1195.68s)]
*  And that was an important message for our people to see, for Ukrainians to see, for [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1197.2s)]
*  Russians to see, and for our allies to see. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1204.64s)]
*  It was the connection between our two countries, the commitment to democracy that we associate [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1208.4s)]
*  ourselves with in terms of the courage of the people of Ukraine. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1215.92s)]
*  What about China? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1221.52s)]
*  Hm? [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1222.4s)]
*  China is seeing. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1223.04s)]
*  Oh, you were talking about China. [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1224.0s)]
*  I thought you were talking about Russia. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1225.28s)]
*  Yeah, China can see that as well. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1227.04s)]
*  That's a wholeish subject. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1230.8s)]
*  That's another press conference for whoever wants to take that up. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1232.56s)]
*  But China, you know, I've been on the China case since Tiananmen Square. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1238.72s)]
*  Even before that, I had met with His Holiness the Dalai Lama and had concerns about treatment [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1244.88s)]
*  in Tibet. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1250.56s)]
*  And then when Tiananmen Square came, we were more active in terms of the trade, proliferation [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1251.76s)]
*  of weapons of mass destruction, human rights, and all the rest of that. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1263.28s)]
*  Interesting to see how China calibrates its activities with Russia and all of this. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1269.36s)]
*  But I think it was an important message. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1275.4399999999998s)]
*  And isn't it interesting that December to December, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1277.6s)]
*  see, I invited him October 20. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1280.4s)]
*  I was asked by, I went to Croatia for a meeting of something called the Crimea Platform Initiative, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1282.3200000000002s)]
*  which was about 50 countries represented with speakers to talk about how we would work together [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1290.16s)]
*  for democracy in Ukraine and the military, support of the military effort. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1297.92s)]
*  At that time, October 24, in a meeting with the delegation from Ukraine, they asked for [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1304.96s)]
*  a joint session. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1312.8000000000002s)]
*  They asked for some other things too, like patriots. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1313.8400000000001s)]
*  They're going to go back home to the strip too. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1316.48s)]
*  But then, of course, it was a question of time. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1318.88s)]
*  And I have to say, Leader McConnell was so supportive right from the start. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1323.0400000000002s)]
*  Right from the start. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1330.56s)]
*  That was a real comfort level to come back and see in a bipartisan, bicameral way, [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1331.84s)]
*  that we can do this. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1336.72s)]
*  And that it would happen in Easter week, when the visit from Churchill was Easter week, [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1339.28s)]
*  excuse me, Christmas week, the day after Christmas, this a few days before Christmas, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1346.08s)]
*  is inspiring. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1352.16s)]
*  It's very inspiring. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1355.04s)]
*  So again, it's a message that is inspirational, as well as strong and informative [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1356.4s)]
*  as to our bipartisan, bicameral support for Ukraine, as well as admiring the leadership [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1364.48s)]
*  of our president, President Biden. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1373.3600000000001s)]
*  The DeLessandro family present for Churchill, you knew President Kennedy, the Pelosi family [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1377.6000000000001s)]
*  through you serving in the House through all of this history. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1384.96s)]
*  You have been in the Democratic leadership now for two decades, speaker of the House twice. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1388.16s)]
*  This is a major transition moment to now move into a different role in the House your family [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1394.0s)]
*  has long been connected to. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1398.8s)]
*  Could you offer us some thoughts about how you will approach your new role in the House [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1401.04s)]
*  in the new year, both on policy and on your role with the Democratic Party? [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1407.04s)]
*  How do you see 2023 for Congresswoman Pelosi? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1412.08s)]
*  Well, we could have a whole seminar on that, but we won't because we're waiting to hear [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1417.28s)]
*  from the Senate. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1423.76s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1425.1999999999998s)]
*  As speaker of the House, I have awesome power. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1427.1999999999998s)]
*  As a now transitioning to a different role, I expect to have strong influence, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1433.84s)]
*  but not on my members, just in terms of encouraging more women, for example, to run, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1440.64s)]
*  to talk about civics and how we have to. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1449.76s)]
*  Used to be a requirement when I was little, 100 years ago, but now it's elected and most [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1453.28s)]
*  people are not familiar. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1459.12s)]
*  So I have to see what that path is. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1460.16s)]
*  But the speaker of the House is a very big job, and just wrapping it up will take time [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1463.6000000000001s)]
*  with the Library of Congress, for the papers, with the historian of the Congress, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1472.4s)]
*  in terms of interviews and the rest of that. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1478.72s)]
*  And in just, I think that probably the most overwhelming thing I'll be doing forever [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1482.0800000000002s)]
*  is saying thank you. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1488.8000000000002s)]
*  Thank you to my members. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1490.4s)]
*  Thank you to the intellectual resources that have helped us with policy. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1491.76s)]
*  Thank you for those who've helped us politically to attain our majorities and our strength [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1495.68s)]
*  in the Congress. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1500.8s)]
*  I think my life will be about accountability to the record, the history, and thank you [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1502.64s)]
*  to those who made all of that possible. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1512.48s)]
*  Do you mention John F. Kennedy? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1515.2s)]
*  I'll close with this. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1516.72s)]
*  You've heard me say it many times. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1518.4s)]
*  Say it now again, because it identifies with what President Biden has been doing. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1520.8s)]
*  When I was in school, I went to President Kennedy's inauguration. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1527.2s)]
*  On the East Front, freezing cold. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1532.4s)]
*  Freezing cold. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1535.92s)]
*  The whole world, every child in America knows that in that speech he said to the citizens [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1537.76s)]
*  of America, ask not what our country can do for you, but what you can do for our country. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1543.44s)]
*  You've said it. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1548.72s)]
*  I see you all mouthing it. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1549.44s)]
*  The very next sentence is what struck me. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1551.6000000000001s)]
*  The very next sentence, to the citizens of the world, ask not what America can do for [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1556.0s)]
*  you, but what we can do working together for the freedom of mankind. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1560.72s)]
*  That's what President Kennedy said. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1566.96s)]
*  Not condescension, not doing something for, but working together. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1569.28s)]
*  And I've said this to President Biden, and I said it at the St. Patrick's Day lunch, [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1575.44s)]
*  because that Kennedy connection there. [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1579.68s)]
*  I said to President Biden, you have fulfilled in so many ways what President Kennedy was [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1582.48s)]
*  signaling, working together with all of the countries to come together to support Ukraine. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1591.12s)]
*  Not by dictating what we think is the way to go, but to listening, working together, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1598.5600000000002s)]
*  so that everybody felt committed to a plan for the freedom of mankind. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1606.16s)]
*  And that's how I tie being there as my father's daughter at the inauguration to what happened [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1612.96s)]
*  this week and what our responsibilities are later. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1622.0800000000002s)]
*  But my goal and my wish is that the members that are new leadership in the House, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1625.84s)]
*  based on the foundation that we have laid, or forming their own approach, will do even [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1634.08s)]
*  better than the significant legislative successes that I have had as Speaker of the House. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1640.6399999999999s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1647.52s)]
*  Happy holidays. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1648.1599999999999s)]

*  Thank you. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1657.04s)]
*  The Giants lost out on Correa. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1657.6s)]
*  You have to comment on the Giants. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1659.6s)]
*  If you went to the Giants, the San Francisco Giants were supposed to get cleared, and he's [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1663.52s)]
*  now a match. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1668.6399999999999s)]
*  You must comment on the preeminent fan of the San Francisco Giants. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1670.0s)]
*  I was celebrating when he was coming to the Giants. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1674.72s)]
*  But you know, I'll talk to you later. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1680.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1682.3999999999999s)]
*  Right now, we just want to see who's winning on these events. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IuUUQken9lE&t=1683.04s)]
