# Hamas claims Israel not abiding by cease-fire terms
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A)
*  Well, Alex Hogan joins us now live from Jerusalem. Alex, I assume you've heard this Reuters report. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm wondering if we have been able to confirm it independently at all. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=6.4s)]
*  Hi, David. So yes, there's an official statement coming from Hamas officials saying that they are [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=11.6s)]
*  delaying the start of the release of these hostages, citing they claim that Israel is not [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=16.0s)]
*  abiding by the conditions of the ceasefire. What they mean by that, they're arguing that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=23.2s)]
*  there's simply not enough aid that is flowing into Gaza to give relief to the more than a million [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=27.92s)]
*  people who have been displaced. We know that within southern Gaza, there's been a growing, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=33.760000000000005s)]
*  growing number of civilians that have been displaced because of the fighting throughout [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=37.52s)]
*  Gaza. About three quarters of the more than two million population are out of their homes [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=41.68s)]
*  because of the fighting. So Hamas has not given any clarity as to specifically how long this delay [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=47.36s)]
*  could take place, but that is what they are citing right now, that there needs to be [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=52.72s)]
*  more humanitarian aid sent in in order for the release of these hostages. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=56.56s)]
*  We had heard earlier this hour from officials in Egypt that they had started to see Hamas [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=60.72s)]
*  bring the hostages, start to transfer them to the Red Cross. Obviously, that has all been halted [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=67.2s)]
*  at this point as we will wait to see how all of this unfolds. This has been the main reason why [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  Israel has not been releasing the specific names on the list of which hostages would be released, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=78.16s)]
*  out of concerns that something could happen just like this, that there could be either a pause, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=83.44s)]
*  end to the ceasefire, which thankfully we have not seen that. But there's been a lot of concern, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=89.44s)]
*  a lot of anxiety here on the ground that all of this could flip on a switch and we could stop to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=94.4s)]
*  see the hostage release taking place. But it is worth noting there's still a major effort on both [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=99.68s)]
*  sides to see all of this unfold as the deal had been brokered, that there should be more humanitarian [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=105.36s)]
*  aid going into Gaza, that Israel would release 150 Palestinians in exchange for these 50 hostages. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=110.72s)]
*  Those goals are still very much at the forefront of the minds of both parties. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=118.0s)]
*  So we'll continue to watch this. We're also getting more images that are coming out now [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=122.32s)]
*  of at least the 13 Israeli family members and families who are together for the very first day. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  One little boy, a nine-year-old, Ohad, right now he's actually not only having a party at the [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=132.64s)]
*  hospital with his friends, but he's also seeing the images and the photos his parents showing him, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=137.12s)]
*  all the messages that he received while he was in captivity. So there's a lot unfolding at the same [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=142.08s)]
*  time. These are the images of all of the 13 hostages who have been released in the last 24 hours. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=147.12s)]
*  So 13 other hostages, potentially 14, were expected to be on the way back to Israel right now. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=154.16s)]
*  And what would have taken place, they would have been handed over to the Red Cross, made their way [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=160.96s)]
*  through the Rafa crossing, made their way back to Israeli soil where they would go through those [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=164.96s)]
*  medical examinations before going to hospitals and finally be reunited with their families. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=169.52s)]
*  A lot of hope on the ground that all of this will still take place. We'll have to wait and see [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=174.88s)]
*  to see how Israel responds to this. We don't have an official statement from Israeli officials [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=179.36s)]
*  just yet as to whether they will send in more humanitarian aid if the aid that has been sent [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=184.8s)]
*  in so far is what should suffice. So we'll continue to monitor this here on the ground. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=190.08s)]
*  Very, very quickly, Alex, are you hearing from Israelis the suggestion that this could on the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=194.8s)]
*  part of Hamas be a subterfuge, these issues that they're having with the next group of released [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  subterfuge to simply delay military operations against them in Gaza by the Israelis? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=207.68s)]
*  Well, I think, and also you mentioned this with your last guest asking, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=215.6s)]
*  is Hamas using this to its advantage to try to reassess its forces, build back its strength? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=218.79999999999998s)]
*  I think one thing worth noting, it is important to stress just before the ceasefire. We did see [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=226.07999999999998s)]
*  both sides typically before a ceasefire will build up their military operations. And Israel said [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=231.76s)]
*  it wanted to make sure that it was known that it was able to destroy as many as 400 tunnels. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=237.04s)]
*  So really taking out a lot of Hamas infrastructure to make sure that during this ceasefire, Hamas [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=242.16s)]
*  wasn't able to reassess, remove its forces, and reestablish itself. But one concern we've also [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=247.6s)]
*  been hearing on the ground, which is interesting to think of, with the unfolding of the whole [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=253.44s)]
*  scenario that we saw yesterday with the release of these hostages given back to Israel, that was all [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=259.2s)]
*  organized and delivered quite well. We saw everything go according to plan yesterday. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=264.48s)]
*  And while that's a big win here for Israel, it was also seen as an obvious sign that Hamas [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=269.92s)]
*  is quite organized, which is the last thing that Israeli forces would want to see and the Israeli [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=277.2s)]
*  government would want to see after almost seven weeks of this war of trying to dismantle Hamas. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=281.92s)]
*  So right now we are seeing this potential delay. It is worth noting yesterday the hostages were [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=286.8s)]
*  not released exactly at 4 p.m. local. There was a couple hours that was delayed, and the goal is [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  for that to resume any moment now. Excellent reporting. Alex Hogan reporting from Jerusalem. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=298.8s)]
*  Stay close, Alex. Thank you very much. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YIjsoHrHm6A&t=304.0s)]
