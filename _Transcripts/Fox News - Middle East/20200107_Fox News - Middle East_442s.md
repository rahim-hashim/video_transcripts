# Stampede during Soleimani's funeral leaves at least 40 dead: reports
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert. Overnight, 32 people killed and nearly 200 hurt during [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=0.0s)]
*  a stampede at the funeral for Iran's top military leader killed by a U.S. airstrike. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=8.1s)]
*  This comes as Iran's Revolutionary Guard says it will set ablaze places supported by the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=13.86s)]
*  United States while that country designates the American military as a terror organization. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=19.14s)]
*  The United States now warning ships across the Middle East of the possibility of Iranian [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=25.74s)]
*  action against U.S. maritime interests. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=31.7s)]
*  All right. Let's bring in the ambassador, White House national security advisor Robert [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=34.54s)]
*  O'Brien as you can see. He's on the North Lawn. The White House. Ambassador, good morning [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=40.58s)]
*  to you. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  Good morning. Good morning. Good to be with you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  Tell us about these new threats. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=47.5s)]
*  Well look, these threats have been around for 40 years, ever since the Iranian Revolution [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=50.06s)]
*  took place. The Iranian regime has been threatening shipping interests, has been threatening Americans, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=53.779999999999994s)]
*  has been taking hostages and has been attacking their neighbors. So this is nothing new, but [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  we're watching it carefully and we've sent a very strong message to the Iranian regime [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=62.5s)]
*  that we're not going to tolerate it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=66.9s)]
*  Ambassador, does this have to do with the imminent intel that they had gathered last [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=68.78s)]
*  week that wound up having the president pull the trigger on General Suleiman? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=73.46s)]
*  The president has always made it his first priority to protect American citizens and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=79.78s)]
*  the intel that we had, the information we had, which we believe was very strong, showed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=84.10000000000001s)]
*  that Suleimani and those he was plotting with were looking to kill American diplomats and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=89.5s)]
*  soldiers in significant numbers in the coming days and that's why the president authorized [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=95.06s)]
*  the successful operation that was undertaken by the U.S. military. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=99.9s)]
*  Ambassador, the president was tweeting this. He said Iran will never have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=103.18s)]
*  How does the death of this terrorist general change our path in keeping Iran from getting [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=109.02s)]
*  a nuclear bomb? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=114.1s)]
*  Well, Suleimani was heavily involved from the early days in the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=115.69999999999999s)]
*  He was sanctioned by the U.N. In fact, he was not supposed to be traveling outside of Iran [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=120.25999999999999s)]
*  under U.N. sanctions because of his role in the nuclear program. So we think it will have [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=124.74s)]
*  an effect. We also believe it is a piece of strength and it was a deterrent to future [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=128.82s)]
*  Iranian action that has been prescribed by the U.N. and by the international community. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=133.98s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, we know that this president ran on scrapping the Iran deal, which he did. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=138.73999999999998s)]
*  And we knew the Iranians were cheating on it before and they're certainly cheating on [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=143.66s)]
*  it now. They used the death of the terrorist, Suleimani, as an excuse, as a justification [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=146.61999999999998s)]
*  to pretend like they were cheating on it. Now they say they're blowing right through [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=152.06s)]
*  the parameters of the deal. What is this, what specifically has changed as far as the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=155.42s)]
*  White House's approach toward Iran to enforce what the president tweeted, that they will [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  never get a nuclear bomb if they are really going to sprint now to try to get one? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=165.10000000000002s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, we've been in touch with our friends and allies in Europe and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=169.74s)]
*  in the region and there is absolutely zero appetite in the international community for [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=173.18s)]
*  Iran to have a nuclear weapon. That won't happen. There are U.N. resolutions against [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=176.62s)]
*  Iran having a nuclear weapon. The nonproliferation treaty prohibits them from getting a nuclear [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=181.58s)]
*  weapon and we think there's going to be a broad consensus to stop Iran. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=187.06s)]
*  But the U.N. is never going to enforce that, Mr. Ambassador. You know that. The U.N. doesn't [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=189.5s)]
*  drop bombs to enforce things. They write resolutions that are ultimately meaningless if someone [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=192.46s)]
*  doesn't step up. Is the U.S. prepared in any means necessary to stop that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=196.3s)]
*  I think the president made it very clear that Iran will not have a nuclear weapon and I [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=201.5s)]
*  think we've got a lot of friends and allies both in the region and in Europe who are committed [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=205.9s)]
*  to that outcome. Speaking of the United Nations, Mr. Ambassador, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=209.46s)]
*  on Thursday there was going to be a U.N. Security Council meeting. The foreign minister Zarif [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=213.46s)]
*  from Iran wanted to go, but apparently last night the U.S. State Department denied his [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=219.57999999999998s)]
*  visa. Why is that? I don't think Secretary Pompeo thought that [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=224.85999999999999s)]
*  this was the right time for Mr. Zarif to come to the United States and whenever he comes [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  to New York he spreads propaganda. I actually find it somewhat ironic that Mr. Zarif wants [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=234.7s)]
*  to take advantage of the diplomatic niceties of being able to come to New York and come [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=240.7s)]
*  to the U.N. When his revolution was born in the taking of 52 American diplomats hostage [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=244.74s)]
*  in Iran and holding them for 444 days, that undermined every principle of diplomacy and [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=251.26000000000002s)]
*  the Iranians, that's how they started their revolution is by taking diplomats hostage. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=259.42s)]
*  So I think he'll be fine missing that meeting. He can certainly call into the meeting or [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=263.5s)]
*  he can participate by video teleconference and his voice will be heard if he wants to [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=267.54s)]
*  be heard. Before the revolution women didn't have to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=272.58s)]
*  wear, they didn't have to cover their faces, they were highly educated. Ben Rhodes who [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=274.3s)]
*  he was deputy national security advisor under President Obama, he says that voting for President [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=279.86s)]
*  Trump is dangerous to our national security. This is what he tweeted. He said, we have [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=283.7s)]
*  a president in the midst of a full meltdown during a major crisis of his own making. A [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=287.21999999999997s)]
*  vote for this man is dangerous for our national security. What are your thoughts? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=292.53999999999996s)]
*  Well my thoughts are, you know, Ben Rhodes was a communications guy in the Obama administration [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=296.94s)]
*  and that was his job, was to do political communication for the president. You know, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=300.86s)]
*  in my last job I spent two years bringing back hostages, most of whom were taken in [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=306.38s)]
*  the prior administration and as those of you in the media who followed it know, I made [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=311.06s)]
*  up my policy not to criticize the prior administration. I'm not going to criticize the Obama administration [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=315.86s)]
*  today but I'm going to say that we have a fundamental disagreement with Ben Rhodes and [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=320.86s)]
*  people who think like Ben Rhodes. The president believes that weakness is provocative and [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=324.14s)]
*  I think we've seen that throughout history. We believe in peace or strength like Ronald [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=328.58s)]
*  Reagan did. It's something that's been a cornerstone of President Trump's foreign policy and national [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=332.26s)]
*  security policy. We believe a strong America deters our aggressors. We believe a weak America [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=337.38s)]
*  and an America that's willing to appease our aggressors invites more violence against American [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=343.46s)]
*  citizens and so we're committed to a peace or strength foreign policy and that's just [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=348.29999999999995s)]
*  a fundamental disagreement that we have with Ben Rhodes and there are people that take [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  a different view. He's certainly one of them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=356.02s)]
*  Ambassador, before you leave, from the intel, and you mentioned a moment ago that some of [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=359.18s)]
*  that imminent intel involved Iranian interests striking out at American diplomats in that [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=363.82s)]
*  region. I think that's something we had not heard before. What else can you tell us about [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=371.1s)]
*  that? Well, I can tell you that there were plans that were being made and that Soleimani [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=374.7s)]
*  was in the midst of that plotting. That's why he was traveling in the region to Damascus [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=378.82s)]
*  and Beirut and Baghdad to conspire with people to attack American facilities that contain [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=382.1s)]
*  diplomats, soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardmen. So the president was very [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=387.9s)]
*  concerned about that activity. Soleimani and the Iranian regime knew exactly what they [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=394.34s)]
*  were doing and what I think they did is they underestimated the president and his restraint. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=398.65999999999997s)]
*  They downed several drones, they attacked a Ramco, they'd been involved in a number [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=404.17999999999995s)]
*  of indirect fire incidents on our facilities over the last several months and the president's [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  been very restrained and they took that restraint and that goodwill as the president tried to [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=412.85999999999996s)]
*  open negotiations with the Iranians. Remember, he offered to speak with them unconditionally. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=418.6s)]
*  They took that as a sign of weakness. I think they understand now that this president means [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  business and they made a bad mistake in how they read his restraint, which was admirable. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=426.08s)]
*  Yep, Soleimani was not on a friendship tour around the Middle East, that's for sure. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=433.71999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. Mr. Ambassador, thank you for your time. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=438.36s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=440.44s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=440.76s)]
*  Thank you. Thanks for having me. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4F8pdticvc&t=441.08s)]
