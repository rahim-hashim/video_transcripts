# Biden is a ‘totally weak and unprincipled machine politician’: Hilton
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM)
*  The White House on defense again on Monday, the U.S. abstained in a vote from a UN Security [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=0.0s)]
*  Council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire between Israel and the Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=7.12s)]
*  Yeah, they didn't vote no, they didn't veto, they abstained, which is fancy for, I'll just [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  hold my cards. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=18.02s)]
*  That resolution passed despite not calling for the release of any, any of the hostages. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=20.0s)]
*  The White House once again insisting this part. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=26.3s)]
*  What caused the shift and what is the president's reason for allowing this to go through? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=31.380000000000003s)]
*  It is a change. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=37.82s)]
*  No, it is not. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=38.82s)]
*  It is not a policy change. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=39.82s)]
*  We've been very clear. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=41.38s)]
*  We disagree, disagree. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=42.38s)]
*  We've been very clear that in order, in order to get a hostage deal that would lead to a [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=45.92s)]
*  ceasefire, we also got to get the humanitarian aid. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=49.620000000000005s)]
*  We believe it is all connected in that way. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  And so that is where we stood. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=55.88s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu canceled an Israeli delegation trip to Washington, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  D.C. because we voted, remember, I'll just hold my card style by abstaining, but is now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=64.66s)]
*  reversing course. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=70.48s)]
*  The two sides, the U.S. and Israel, are working now on a date for those meetings. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=72.68s)]
*  They're going to try to revive that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=78.38s)]
*  And as we watch tensions rise between Israel and the Biden administration, a new Fox poll [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  shows Trump with a double digit lead over Biden when it comes to handling foreign policy. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=85.06s)]
*  So this hour, a double digit lead on immigration for Trump over Biden, a double digit lead [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=91.14s)]
*  on Trump over Biden on foreign policy. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=97.98s)]
*  Just keep in score here. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=100.46s)]
*  Here's a look at the president's comments since Hamas's October 7th massacre of Israelis. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=101.97999999999999s)]
*  And it raises questions over where he stands now when it comes to our greatest ally in [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=108.14s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=112.3s)]
*  My administration's support for Israel's security is rock solid and unwavering. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=114.3s)]
*  I come to Israel with a single message. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=119.46s)]
*  As long as the United States stands and we will stand forever, we'll not let you ever [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=121.86s)]
*  be alone. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=126.22s)]
*  I have no notion that Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=127.22s)]
*  I'm sure innocents have been killed. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=131.78s)]
*  And it's the price of waging a war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=133.9s)]
*  I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=136.06s)]
*  has been over the top. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=149.3s)]
*  The major military operation in Ra'a Al-Fa should not proceed without a credible plan, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=153.78s)]
*  a credible plan for ensuring the safety and support of more than one million people sheltering [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=158.86s)]
*  there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=164.14000000000001s)]
*  They need to be protected. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=165.14s)]
*  Steve Hilton, Fox News contributor. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=174.85999999999999s)]
*  So is there a shift? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=177.5s)]
*  There is a massive shift, but it's not surprising. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=181.61999999999998s)]
*  What you saw there is exactly what many of us have been saying about Biden for years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=184.14s)]
*  For all his time in public life, 50 years in politics, we've seen what he is. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=189.7s)]
*  He goes from one position to another on every issue, depending on what is best for him politically. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=195.06s)]
*  He's a totally weak and unprincipled machine politician who will say anything and do anything [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=200.78s)]
*  to cling to power and climb the ladder. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=206.9s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing now. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=209.26s)]
*  I mean, honestly, Harris, I thought that Biden couldn't go any lower than he did with that [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=210.5s)]
*  disgraceful exit from Afghanistan, but he has gone lower. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=215.42000000000002s)]
*  Because if you look at what he said over the last few weeks or so, that Israel's behavior [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=219.06s)]
*  is over the top, even as just this week in The New York Times, David Brooks writing after [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=224.5s)]
*  speaking to many military analysts, that Israel's conduct of the urban warfare in Gaza, they're [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=228.9s)]
*  going to greater lengths, much greater lengths to avoid civilian casualties than we did in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=235.1s)]
*  Iraq and Afghanistan, by the way, when Biden was vice president. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=240.1s)]
*  And then you look at what Jake Sullivan's been saying, that Israel should not pursue [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=243.74s)]
*  the remainder of the Hamas death squads and their army into Rafah and use some other way [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=248.54s)]
*  of doing it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=253.18s)]
*  And then you look at the resolution in the UN and add it all up. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=254.18s)]
*  And what it tells you is that actually this Biden administration, their official position, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=257.62s)]
*  regardless of what they claim, the official position of the Biden administration now is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=262.42s)]
*  for Israel to lose this war against Hamas because they're worried about losing the election [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=267.06s)]
*  to Donald Trump. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=271.72s)]
*  And they don't care that the bloodthirsty terrorists are going to win if that happens [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=273.06s)]
*  again and again and again. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=277.3s)]
*  And they're going to do what they did on October 7th again and again, because we've already [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=278.66s)]
*  been told by their leader who's like, you know, up in some kind of nice digs and cutter. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=281.7s)]
*  OK, we've seen countless anti-Israel protests target Biden and administration officials. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=288.26s)]
*  Just this week alone, a member of an anti-Israeli youth group gathered outside the houses of [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=294.98s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lord Austin and NSA Jake Sullivan. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=300.7s)]
*  While they were chanting and holding up signs and everything, they were so classy, dropping [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=305.98s)]
*  manure, so on and so forth. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=310.3s)]
*  So this is a problem for the left. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=311.74s)]
*  Watch. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=313.62s)]
*  Allow them to deny coverage. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=314.62s)]
*  Everybody deserves health care. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=322.53999999999996s)]
*  So while that was going on, also this week, they were protesting, as you just saw, a visit [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=328.5s)]
*  by Israeli's defense minister in Washington and then President Biden in another instance [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=333.53999999999996s)]
*  responding to one protester who interrupted his speech in North Carolina. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=340.04s)]
*  Allow them to deny coverage. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=346.68s)]
*  Everybody deserves health care. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Be patient with them. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=358.52000000000004s)]
*  They have a point. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=364.08000000000004s)]
*  We need to get a lot more care in their process. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=365.16s)]
*  So you got to see that part twice. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  Watch this part. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=371.44s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton saying when Biden says they have a point to pro-Hamas hecklers, here [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=372.44s)]
*  he is on X, he signals that anti-Israel radicals can push him around. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=377.56s)]
*  It's a sign of weakness, inviting more disruption and a gift to Hamas. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=383.08000000000004s)]
*  Steve, this makes every point you made and it's sad because these are what we call receipts. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=387.64s)]
*  They're not going away. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=393.36s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=394.36s)]
*  And Tom Cotton's exactly right. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=395.36s)]
*  By the way, sometimes you just have to laugh at how ludicrous it is. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  Not just anti-Israel radicals, anti-Israel idiots. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=400.64s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=403.76s)]
*  Health care in Gaza? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=405.56s)]
*  Hey, talk to Hamas about that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=406.76s)]
*  They've been running Gaza for years. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=408.84000000000003s)]
*  What happened to them and their health care? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=411.8s)]
*  It's so ridiculous. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=413.92s)]
*  It makes you wonder, honestly, what's been going on in our education system for all these [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=415.08s)]
*  years? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=420.16s)]
*  So many people, so utterly ignorant. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=421.16s)]
*  When you were in London and in government there with the former Prime Minister David [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=424.2s)]
*  Cameron, how did you handle this? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=430.0s)]
*  What are we doing? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=433.4s)]
*  What are we missing? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=434.4s)]
*  Look, the thing is that you've got to have... [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=437.4s)]
*  This is the golden rule of politics that I've seen in many, many years of being involved. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=440.47999999999996s)]
*  You've got to have principles and sometimes they're going to be tested. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=445.15999999999997s)]
*  But if you don't have conviction, if you don't have principles, Margaret Thatcher, first [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=449.35999999999996s)]
*  one in my experience in my lifetime to be known as a conviction politician, then yes, [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=453.8s)]
*  there'll be protests. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=460.04s)]
*  I mean, for example, with Margaret Thatcher, for nearly a year, the vicious protest that [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=461.04s)]
*  accompanied a strike by mine workers, but she held out and it was the transformation [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=465.36s)]
*  of the British economy that resulted. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=470.86s)]
*  You have to stick firm and for a few protesters to blow you off course is just utterly pathetic. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=472.84000000000003s)]
*  Well thank you for reaching back on that. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sU6-2NmCXCM&t=480.04s)]
