# Online 'stealth edits' to Biden official's Middle East essay
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0)
*  National Security Council spokesman John Kirby was talking about those airstrikes just a short time ago. Let's watch that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, these these strikes were very much done in self-defense as you know [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=8.32s)]
*  Our forces and facilities had come under a range of attacks by rocket attacks largely by these proxy groups [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=12.14s)]
*  But they're backed by Iran in Iraq and in Syria these strikes were in self-defense for our ability to protect ourselves and our troops [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=18.5s)]
*  I mean they went right at [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=26.44s)]
*  Targets that were tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps the IRGC that is [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  Resourcing funding training and making capable all these proxy groups these two targets went right at their storage facilities [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=35.18s)]
*  Weapons facilities that kind of thing to try to get at their ability to do exactly that in [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=41.8s)]
*  focus now retired Marine Lieutenant Colonel Dakota wood senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation and former strategist [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=46.84s)]
*  For the Marine Corps Special Operations Command great to have you in focus today. Let's start with [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=54.04s)]
*  Proportionality they hit us 19 times in the last week [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=61.12s)]
*  We hit a couple of structures targeted that had weapons in it what they could use against us. How is that proportionality? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=65.08s)]
*  Well, it's ridiculous. I mean, you know, you're great reporting and those your colleagues have pointed out how silly these responses are [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=73.44s)]
*  It's a minimalist approach it is delayed and that what that does is gives your enemy [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=80.76s)]
*  More opportunities to attack you with no consequences at all. So a two-plane package [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  Plane's these aircraft always fly in pairs is the smallest thing the US could have done and to go after the weapons stores [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=93.04s)]
*  Ostensibly to take away the ability to conduct attacks without actually going against the enemy [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=101.4s)]
*  The people who use those weapons when Iran has a near limitless supply of rockets and bombs and mortars [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  It just doesn't make sense. The White House loves nuance [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=113.44s)]
*  Warfare combat in your enemy doesn't tolerate nuance very well and it just sends all the wrong messages [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=117.08s)]
*  You know how they could hit Iran in terms of what they can supply to these groups these terror groups [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=123.0s)]
*  Why don't they put back in place with the United Nations sanctions were that expired last Wednesday? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=130.24s)]
*  That put all these items on the market [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=136.08s)]
*  So Iran could not only make money selling its killer drones and its its ballistics [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=138.72s)]
*  But but they can put them wherever they want to put them. What why not hit them there? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=143.68s)]
*  Why not snap back with your own sanctions as America? Well, that's true. I mean a hundred billion released or made possible by the [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=147.32s)]
*  Obama administration another six billion made possible by the Biden administration [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=155.20000000000002s)]
*  In spite of its protests that Iran won't use it for this kind of mischief, right so you could do that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=160.56s)]
*  Instantaneously, I would support that the problem is is those are kind of long-term [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=168.16s)]
*  Fixes, you know or effects that you want to see right now. We've got fighters and they've got weapons [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=175.0s)]
*  There's a today challenge threatening our troops and the administration isn't really doing anything to address that challenge [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=179.56s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=185.84s)]
*  They're very risk-averse they're very cautious and timid whether it's Ukraine or support to Israel [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=187.6s)]
*  Responding to these constant strikes by Iran's minions [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=194.79999999999998s)]
*  Against the United States that they wait until pressure mounts and they're forced to act they take a minimalist approach [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=198.56s)]
*  It'd be like taking half your dose of antibiotic when you're sick [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=204.88s)]
*  You know [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=208.68s)]
*  It means it means that the virus gets that much worse and your enemy gets that much more opportunity in time to entrench their [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=209.32s)]
*  position to continue to a trip [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=216.36s)]
*  US capabilities in the area and so when you then do something in a minimalist way you're using resources [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=219.24s)]
*  But with no discernible effect or benefit from that so it actually worsens the problem [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=225.88s)]
*  so if you're concerned about broadening the conflict or making it more contentious or [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=231.62s)]
*  You know adding more actors to the fray this approach by the administration actually does that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Makes a problem worse instead of solving it a couple of things to further the metaphor with antibiotics if you only take half the dose then [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=245.44s)]
*  The thing that you're trying to kill in the body actually becomes immune to whatever you hit it with and then it kills you [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=252.96s)]
*  So to further that metaphor if we don't do a full job of showing them proportionality and hitting them where it hurts when they hit [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=258.92s)]
*  Us 19 times in a week [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=265.28s)]
*  They'll just keep killing us and by the way [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=267.36s)]
*  I still can't figure out why this White House doesn't see those men and women in the military as as much human beings as anybody else on the planet [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=269.8s)]
*  Why not protect them former President Trump said to Iran you hit one of our people you kill just one and I'll hit Tehran [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=278.24s)]
*  That they hit Syria two places that basically only had ammo in the building from what they're reporting risk averse [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=284.84s)]
*  How risky was it? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=292.47999999999996s)]
*  To give Iran on top of a five-by-five prisoner deal six billion dollars [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  They maybe didn't need the money, but it allowed them to spend other money and bank that cash [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  Well, that's it. I mean a lot of people have talked about this, you know the fungibility of funding [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=304.92s)]
*  So if I give you a dollar to buy an orange [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=309.5s)]
*  It means that you don't have to use your own dollar to buy that that's right [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=311.56s)]
*  And you can use that dollar to buy a you know a bullet or something along those lines [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=315.32s)]
*  So it's an absolutely ridiculous argument made by the administration the same kind of ridiculousness [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=318.92s)]
*  That goes along with the US saying look this strike in Syria to protect US forces has nothing to do with the Israeli conflict [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=324.56s)]
*  Well, they may want to believe that but if you're Iran and you're Hezbollah and Hamas and the Islamic State and others [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=332.68s)]
*  You see this as part of a larger fight, right? So it's all part and parcel the same thing. So again, it's this kind of [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=340.06s)]
*  distraction this detachment from the reality of conflict and the reality of [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=347.40000000000003s)]
*  Enemies trying to cause harm to the United States that has put this administration on this policy path [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=352.2s)]
*  Which will actually make the problem worse real quickly Colonel would and I had told the audience [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=358.35999999999996s)]
*  Previously say it again former strategist for the Marine Corps Special Ops Command. What should we be doing? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=364.03999999999996s)]
*  What's the special operations that we should be carrying out right now? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=369.64s)]
*  Well, you indicated some of these things going after not just the weapons stores [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=373.47999999999996s)]
*  But all the logistical supply lines that previous guests have talked about going after the actual fighters the terrorists themselves [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=378.36s)]
*  Much like Israel is doing against Hamas, you know, so Israel is going to go into Gaza [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=386.48s)]
*  They're not going to telegraph what day and time because that would give information to the enemy [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=391.0s)]
*  But they're not just going after a weapons store [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=395.48s)]
*  They're going after the leaders of Hamas the actual terrorists that prosecuted such a horrific [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=398.0s)]
*  Set of murders and atrocities against Israeli citizens [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=404.92s)]
*  So the United States needs to adopt a similar sort of posture so that's not this weird [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=408.72s)]
*  Proportionality, you're actually causing harm to your enemy. All right. I want to get to those critics are lashing out at National Security [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=415.08s)]
*  Advisor Jake Sullivan for his assessment of the Middle East [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=422.08s)]
*  He offered it up about a week before the brutal Hamas terrorists attack a week after that attack. He tried to clean it up [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=425.6s)]
*  The Middle East region is quieter today [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=434.16s)]
*  Than it has been in two decades. Why was your assessment there so far off the mark? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=437.44s)]
*  I made those comments in the context of developments in the wider Middle East region over the last few years [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=441.76s)]
*  The sentence before what you just played I said in fact that this was for now and that it could all change [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=449.04s)]
*  At no point did the Biden administration take its eye off the ball of the threats to Israel and [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=457.24s)]
*  So his words were really only good for what 72 hours [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=464.0s)]
*  Anyway, Sullivan wrote an essay for the magazine foreign policy that included his initial assertion on the quietness of the Middle East [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=467.64s)]
*  Now that portion has been scrubbed from the online version [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=474.76s)]
*  hmm [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=478.96s)]
*  Some scathing reaction one headline the stealth edits that prove Biden's Middle East failure and an excerpt from a New York [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=479.84s)]
*  Post columnist [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=488.52000000000004s)]
*  Anyone with a shred of self-respect would have asked that the entire article be deleted and then resigned his position [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=489.72s)]
*  And headed to the North Pole to live out his days in shame or I guess a Santa's helper your response [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=496.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, you know, I feel really good right now [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=502.96000000000004s)]
*  But when I step out of the building and cross the street don't I have to be aware of cross-traffic that I might get run over [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=504.92s)]
*  Yes, so the administration's responsibility their obligation is the safety and security and economic [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=510.88s)]
*  Vitality of this country so they can't just decide that everything looks great today [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=518.12s)]
*  And that at some point in some mystical future things might not be be so good [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=522.24s)]
*  They have to plan for worst case and then behave in a way and act in a way that actually [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=527.9200000000001s)]
*  Deterrs bad behavior by our enemies that ensures we have the capabilities in place to respond to these Oh surprise [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=533.04s)]
*  Situations like an invasion of a neighboring country or their murder of innocence at a music festival, right? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=540.84s)]
*  I mean, this is their job to do this so to kind of Pollyanna's, you know, wave your hand and say hey [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=546.64s)]
*  Everything's looking good in the Middle East again is a detachment from the reality of the complexity and the violence [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=552.16s)]
*  That characterizes much of the Middle East and they should always be thinking about how to secure US interests [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=558.48s)]
*  And they just fail to do that Jake Sullivan comes off as somebody [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=564.8000000000001s)]
*  When he speaks and when he writes and when they have to edit his words as someone who's on serious [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=568.16s)]
*  Maybe he's not maybe he's just not the right person for the job, but whatever it is [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=573.5799999999999s)]
*  We need the right person for the job [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=578.38s)]
*  Colonel would thank you so very much for your time and your expertise my great pleasure. Thanks [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_6z4yG0eS0&t=580.78s)]
