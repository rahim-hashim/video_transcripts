# 'WHERE WERE YOU?' IDF reservist calls out 'Squad' members
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo)
*  Let's bring in Rudy Rochman. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=0.0s)]
*  He is a reservist for the Israeli Defense Forces and joins us now. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=1.68s)]
*  Rudy, give us the latest on the ground. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=5.84s)]
*  Yeah, so as a reservist, I'm 30 years old. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=8.48s)]
*  Most of my crew are 30, 40-year-olds. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=11.96s)]
*  We have families, we have kids, we have our lives, and all of a sudden we're taken out [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=14.72s)]
*  of our civilian life to have to defend our country. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=18.6s)]
*  On Saturday morning, we were called up and our entire unit were deployed to Kval Aza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=21.04s)]
*  It's one of the villages that saw some of the most gruesome massacres that happened. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=25.12s)]
*  Children, women, elderly, just horrible scenes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  We made sure to get out of the terrorists to secure the land and to make sure that we [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=33.04s)]
*  can actually live in this country. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  Describe the fighting that you've seen so far. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, the fighting is horrible, but I think what we really need to talk about also is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=40.64s)]
*  that people need to understand this is not a left-wing or a right-wing issue. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=44.8s)]
*  This is a human rights issue, and everyone needs to understand that. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  You were talking about earlier on your show how the younger generation is starting to [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=51.440000000000005s)]
*  look down on Israel and think that Israel is illegitimate. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  Well, there's been a strategy of trying to find every single minority group on intellectual [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=58.36s)]
*  spaces, especially on college campuses, and convincing them that the source of the problem [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  is Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=66.72s)]
*  They go to Black Students Union and they convince them that the reason for why there's black [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=67.72s)]
*  problems with the police is because of Israel's training. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=71.8s)]
*  They go to Native American groups and say, well, white colonialists came and started [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=74.4s)]
*  a land and they try to pretend that Jews are white, which we're not, we're indigenous [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=77.16s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=80.08s)]
*  And they've been convincing the younger generation that the source of all problems in the world [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=81.92s)]
*  is the Jewish people. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=86.03999999999999s)]
*  And this is historically how anti-Semitism has happened, and we need to start waking [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  up to it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=90.2s)]
*  The fighting is horrible, but there's two wars going on. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=91.2s)]
*  There's the physical war, which we will prevail and we will come out of. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=93.12s)]
*  And I really hope that we minimize casualties on all sides, for Palestinians and Israelis. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=96.32s)]
*  No one here wants to see anybody dead. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=100.28s)]
*  But we need to understand not just what is happening, why it is happening. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=101.8s)]
*  Hamas knows it's not going to win the war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=105.88s)]
*  It's trying to win a PR war. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=108.28s)]
*  It's intentionally placing its citizens in places where they're shooting rockets out [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=109.68s)]
*  of in order for Israel to defend itself and for casualties to go up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=114.2s)]
*  Hamas wants to increase casualties both for Israelis and for Palestinians in order to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=117.4s)]
*  win a PR war, and we need to be aware of that as well. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=121.2s)]
*  Yeah, Rudy, there are some U.S. lawmakers who are calling for a ceasefire for the greater [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  good of both sides. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  If they were to say that to you, what would your response be? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=129.36s)]
*  Of course we want a ceasefire. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=133.22s)]
*  We don't want to see anybody dying, but we need to go back and take 150 and more kidnapped [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=134.38s)]
*  Israeli citizens and others that were already there for years that have been kidnapped. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=139.56s)]
*  And we need to take out Hamas, not just for the safety of Israelis, but to free Palestinians. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=143.0s)]
*  Hamas is what? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=146.84s)]
*  On its almost 20th year of its four-year term, that is completely occupying the land, oppressing [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=147.84s)]
*  its people, and all these politicians that, you know, like, for example, the squad that [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=152.24s)]
*  talk about as if they championed Palestinian rights. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=155.86s)]
*  Where were you when Palestinians were dying by the thousands in the Syrian civil war? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=158.22s)]
*  Where were you when you talk about the Palestinians that are by the hundreds of thousands of refugee [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=161.46s)]
*  camps in Lebanon and in Jordan or suffering on the border of Gaza and Egypt or under the [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=164.76000000000002s)]
*  Palestinian Authority or Hamas where they don't have the freedom of speech. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=168.28s)]
*  If you truly care about Palestinians, you need to free them, which is why we need to [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=171.32s)]
*  not only talk about the what. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=174.88s)]
*  Casualties are horrible and they should be ended on all sides, Palestinians and Israelis, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=176.16s)]
*  which are cousins. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=179.92000000000002s)]
*  But we need to understand why this is happening as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  Rudy, are you worried about a multi-front war with Lebanon and Hezbollah getting involved? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=183.08s)]
*  Of course we're worried. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=188.6s)]
*  My family lives here. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=189.6s)]
*  This is my country. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=190.6s)]
*  This is my land. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=191.6s)]
*  This is where my kids will be born. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=192.6s)]
*  This is where I need to live. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=193.6s)]
*  So of course we're worried for a war. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=194.6s)]
*  I know that no matter what will happen, we will prevail. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=195.6s)]
*  And I hope that we can prevent that from happening. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=197.76s)]
*  And if we don't, we need to go to war and we need to win. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=199.48s)]
*  And when the smoke settles, we need to make sure to prevent this from happening in the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=202.16s)]
*  future. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=204.88s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=205.88s)]
*  God bless. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DUzr4htWPAo&t=207.24s)]
