# Netanyahu: Trump is making a ‘tremendous change’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM)
*  We're here with our honored guest here, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=0.0s)]
*  Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  How are you, sir? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=4.1s)]
*  I'm terrific, especially after this week in Washington [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  with President Trump. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=8.2s)]
*  You've had a great week in Washington. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=9.700000000000001s)]
*  I think the world has had a great week in Washington. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=11.700000000000001s)]
*  This is probably, in all my years, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=13.94s)]
*  watching Israeli-United States relations. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  The pinnacle. Why is that? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=19.1s)]
*  Is it you and Trump's chemistry? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=20.740000000000002s)]
*  Is it because you're on the same page? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=23.1s)]
*  Why do you think that is? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=24.84s)]
*  I think President Trump is the greatest friend [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=26.8s)]
*  that Israel has ever had in the White House. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  I think he's not only making a tremendous change [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=31.64s)]
*  in the Israeli-American alliance, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=35.34s)]
*  strengthening it beyond anything we've seen up to now, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=37.24s)]
*  but also he's a great leader for America and for the world. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=40.54s)]
*  And all of that comes together [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=42.84s)]
*  in this meeting between two great allies, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=46.24s)]
*  America and Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=48.94s)]
*  Israel has no better friend than America, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=50.34s)]
*  not one to President Trump's leadership. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=53.94s)]
*  And America has no greater friend than Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=56.14s)]
*  And it's a meeting of the minds and hearts. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=58.14s)]
*  And President Trump comes into office [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=60.14s)]
*  and he sees what took place before. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=62.14s)]
*  I don't want to drag you into our world. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=64.64s)]
*  He sees what has taken place before, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=66.14s)]
*  with weapons being withheld and other things taking place. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  And he seems to say, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=73.44s)]
*  I'm going to turn the page on this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=74.44s)]
*  Well, he did right away. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=76.64s)]
*  And I know Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=77.64s)]
*  I've known him a long time. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  You two are friends. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=80.24s)]
*  You have the same principles. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=82.14s)]
*  And he acts immediately, right? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=84.34s)]
*  Instantaneously. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=86.64s)]
*  I mean, what he did in the first two weeks [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=88.03999999999999s)]
*  is to do everything that he promised to do. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=90.44s)]
*  He did great things in his first term. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=93.44s)]
*  He recognized Jerusalem as our capital, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  moved the American embassy there, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  recognized our sovereignty in the Golan Heights, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=99.24s)]
*  got out of the disastrous Iran deal, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=101.44s)]
*  brokered the Abraham Accords [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=106.14s)]
*  in which we made peace with four Arab states. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=107.84s)]
*  He did that in four months. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=110.64s)]
*  Didn't happen in 25 years. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=112.24s)]
*  So he was a great leader then, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=115.44s)]
*  but he started now the second term. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=116.64s)]
*  You know, he hit the tarmac right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=119.64s)]
*  So he got from the delivery of weapons [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=121.53999999999999s)]
*  that were being withheld to us [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=124.84s)]
*  as we're fighting a seven-war front war for our existence [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  against our common enemies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=130.04s)]
*  But, you know, what he did today, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=132.44s)]
*  he went against anti-Semitism. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=135.44s)]
*  He went against the ICC, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=137.54s)]
*  this corrupt so-called international accord [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=140.04s)]
*  that targets America, targets Israel, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=142.64s)]
*  targets democracies. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=145.14s)]
*  Listen, it's a great beginning and a restart, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=146.83999999999997s)]
*  a recalibration of our great alliance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0Cs5LhEeqYM&t=150.94s)]
