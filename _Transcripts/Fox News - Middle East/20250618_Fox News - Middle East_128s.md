# US military forces still deploying to the Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y)
*  Joining us now with the very latest developments out of the Pentagon tonight, our own Jennifer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=0.0s)]
*  Griffin is with us. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=3.92s)]
*  Jennifer, the latest there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=5.2s)]
*  Well, Sean, the president continues to seek assurances from his military commanders that [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=6.68s)]
*  the B-2 option could work in terms of destroying Fordow while weighing what to do next. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=12.68s)]
*  No final order has been given. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=18.76s)]
*  It also takes at least two weeks, I'm told, possibly longer for the U.S. military to get [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=20.68s)]
*  assets ready and into position. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=25.68s)]
*  It's clear that when Israel launched its operation on June 12th, the U.S. military was not positioned [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=28.279999999999998s)]
*  for a potential strike. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=33.6s)]
*  Even tonight, U.S. military forces are still deploying to the Middle East. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=35.56s)]
*  Flight trackers showed 12 F-22 Raptors take off earlier today from Langley Air Force Base [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=39.72s)]
*  in Virginia toward Lakenheath Air Base in the U.K. with expected onward movement to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=45.5s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=51.64s)]
*  The USS Ford, currently in Norfolk, Virginia, will deploy on a normal rotation next week [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=52.64s)]
*  to U.S. European Command, which stretches to the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=58.04s)]
*  The Nimitz won't be in position for another week. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=62.76s)]
*  In Bahrain, the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet has moved out to sea nearly all of its vessels [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=65.88s)]
*  to protect them from a potential Iranian counterattack. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=70.76s)]
*  At the White House today, President Trump had lunch with the head of Pakistan's military. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  Pakistan has a 562-mile-long border with Iran and could be a good staging ground for U.S. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=80.28s)]
*  aircraft, according to former defense officials. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=86.96s)]
*  Pakistan has nuclear weapons, and given its close friendship with Iran, could play a role [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  in mediating. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=95.44s)]
*  The State Department has evacuated the U.S. Embassy in Jerusalem, but is not positioned [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=96.72s)]
*  to evacuate Americans on any large scale from across the Middle East, potentially leaving [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=101.55999999999999s)]
*  many Americans stranded and in harm's way. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=106.72s)]
*  And we've seen how that's ended in the past, Sean. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=110.06s)]
*  All right, Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon tonight. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0lSHcSszf3Y&t=115.72s)]
