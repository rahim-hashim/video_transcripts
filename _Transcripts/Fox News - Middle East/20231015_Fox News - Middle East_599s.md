# 'OPENING OF THE GATES': Republican issues stark warning on Iranian 'infiltration'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE)
*  And we begin this Sunday morning with breaking news from Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=0.0s)]
*  Over 1,300 Israelis are dead this morning, while more than 2,300 Palestinians are dead, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=5.92s)]
*  as well as 29 Americans as the war in Israel enters a ninth day. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=12.34s)]
*  And Israel fights Hamas terrorists, unprovoked attacks. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  Israel dropped leaflets above the Gaza Strip over the weekend and Friday, advising citizens [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=20.86s)]
*  to move south. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=25.5s)]
*  They suggested it was readying a ground assault on Gaza to retaliate for the worst terrorist [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=27.08s)]
*  attack on Israel since 9-11. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=32.1s)]
*  Hamas is reportedly holding 150 hostages, including American citizens, right now. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=34.68s)]
*  Here now with the very latest in this Sunday Morning Futures exclusive is the chairman [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=40.4s)]
*  of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, Congressman Michael McCaul. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=43.44s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for joining us this morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=47.04s)]
*  And I want to get to this Iran message sent to Israel over the weekend. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=50.08s)]
*  But before we get there, you have been given a briefing in the Situation Room. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=53.96s)]
*  Can you assess where we are on this war right now? [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=58.4s)]
*  Well, it's getting very dangerous. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=60.56s)]
*  I think the concern, Maria, is an escalation beyond the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=63.96s)]
*  Right now we're trying to contain it, trying to get the innocent civilians south towards [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=68.36s)]
*  Egypt and open up Egypt so they can go in. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=74.44s)]
*  But the escalation from Hezbollah is real. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=78.1s)]
*  The role of Iran is very real in this. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=82.44s)]
*  You know, Hezbollah has 100,000 rockets that could overload the Iron Dome itself in Israel. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=84.72s)]
*  We do not want that two-front war. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=89.96s)]
*  And so that is a great concern. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=92.84s)]
*  In addition to ISIS in Syria and Iran back to militias in Iraq, and the Taliban is making [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  noise about coming in as well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=101.32s)]
*  We don't want a global jihad in Jerusalem. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=102.72s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=105.96s)]
*  Let's get to this message that Iran sent to Israel on Saturday night. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=107.32s)]
*  It's stressing that it does not want further escalation in the war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=111.28s)]
*  And it said that if it sees Israel go in, in this ground attack, which we are expecting, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=115.2s)]
*  they will have to intervene and Israel will face a quote unquote earthquake. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=121.84s)]
*  Frightening. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=131.4s)]
*  This is the nightmare scenario we've always been worried about. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=132.56s)]
*  Israel, there's no question they're going to go into Gaza. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=136.88s)]
*  It's their 9-11. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=140.08s)]
*  They want justice. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  They're going to go in and take out Hamas, which is like ISIS. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=142.64000000000001s)]
*  You know, I went to that kibbutz where they killed all the little children there and decapitated [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=145.8s)]
*  them. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=152.20000000000002s)]
*  So then what is Iran going to do? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  Are they just going to help their proxies like Hezbollah and others, or are they going [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  to get directly involved in this conflict? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=158.88000000000002s)]
*  Either way, Maria, you know, my committee is charged with war and peace. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=161.60000000000002s)]
*  My committee has the power to declare war or issue an authorized use of military force. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=166.04s)]
*  We don't want to do that. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=171.44s)]
*  But if this escalates, that's what worries me the most. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=173.16s)]
*  Tell me what you're referring to. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=176.76s)]
*  Are you saying that the United States will have to get involved? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=179.0s)]
*  Well, if we want to stop, say, Israel from obliterating Iran, yes. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  And that would be a question for the American people. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=190.68s)]
*  Do we want to get involved to defend Israel? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=193.4s)]
*  Right now, we're just providing weapons and training. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=196.96s)]
*  We're not involved. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=199.32s)]
*  We're not firing our missiles from our destroyer ships in the Mediterranean. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=200.58s)]
*  But the minute that happens, it does trigger the War Powers Act. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=206.0s)]
*  And so that's why we have to be so careful here and pray that it does not escalate to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=209.52s)]
*  that level, because what would follow after that would be very bloody. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=215.0s)]
*  Congressman, I want to get your take on how we got here as well. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=221.64s)]
*  I know that this Robert Malley is under investigation for mishandling classified information. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=227.16s)]
*  He was one of the leaders within certainly what, the Obama administration and the Biden [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=232.76s)]
*  administration negotiating with Iran to get back into an Iran deal? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=237.11999999999998s)]
*  This is what's just you can't make this kind of stuff up, Maria. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=243.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, this is our top negotiator to Iran. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=247.04s)]
*  Our special envoy, Mr. Malley. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=251.79999999999998s)]
*  He is now under investigation by the FBI for mishandling of classified information. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=254.56s)]
*  Well, what did he do with that classified information? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=259.12s)]
*  We don't know exactly yet, but we do know that he was in talks and negotiations with [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=261.58s)]
*  Iran over their nuclear weapons program. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=267.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, there's this independent think tank, the Iranian Expert Initiative. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=270.92s)]
*  He was in association with this think tank that interfaced with the foreign minister [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=278.48s)]
*  of Iran again. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=283.04s)]
*  And then one of these three associates is currently the chief of staff to the assistant [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=285.28000000000003s)]
*  secretary of defense for special operations at the Pentagon, who is a part of this independent [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=290.08000000000004s)]
*  think tank that interfaces with the foreign minister of Iran. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=296.48s)]
*  This is getting a little too close and I'm getting a little too nervous with this coziness [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=300.12s)]
*  between Iran and this administration and State Department and Defense Department. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=305.4s)]
*  I would view it as an infiltration or an opening of the gates of Iran into our government. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=310.64s)]
*  And you have talked about the appeasement that the Biden administration has given to [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=317.28s)]
*  Iran from day one. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=322.84s)]
*  I think you said it was something like 30 billion dollars that this administration allowed [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=324.32s)]
*  Iran to generate by relaxing sanctions on oil sales. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=329.0s)]
*  Is that right? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=333.76s)]
*  30 billion dollars of unenforced sanctions on oil. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=335.76s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=340.56s)]
*  I mean, that has helped them build their war machine, their nuclear weapons program. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=341.56s)]
*  And guess what else it helped? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=346.03999999999996s)]
*  It helped them give them 150 million dollars to Hamas and a bunch of weapons that they [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=347.48s)]
*  then used to invade Israel last Saturday and conduct this massacre on the ground. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=352.2s)]
*  In addition, Maria, you know, this hostage negotiation with giving, you know, getting [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=359.08000000000004s)]
*  five innocent Americans out in exchange for six very culpable Iranian prisoners, culpable [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=364.72s)]
*  of espionage, for lack of a better word. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=371.88s)]
*  That was an unfair trade in and of itself. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=374.72s)]
*  But then you throw six billion dollars on top of that wired from South Korea to Doha. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=376.64000000000004s)]
*  They say it's going to be for humanitarian purposes only. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=383.44s)]
*  Iran says, I'm going to do whatever I want with the money. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=386.52s)]
*  Well, on Monday, I'm introducing a bill to put secondary sanctions on the Doha bank so [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=389.76s)]
*  that it freezes those that six billion dollars, not temporarily, but forever. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=395.2s)]
*  I do not want to see six billion more dollars going into Iran to feed their terror operations [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=400.96s)]
*  throughout the Middle East. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=407.91999999999996s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=409.2s)]
*  And do you have confidence that that bill will be able to move, Congressman? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=410.2s)]
*  I know you're going to be introducing that bill tomorrow morning, but, you know, the [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=413.32s)]
*  administration is trying to message out to the world that it has some kind of a quiet [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  agreement with the Qataris. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=423.55999999999995s)]
*  I read earlier that the former head of Hamas was in Qatar talking with Qatari officials. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=425.44s)]
*  Should we be trusting Qataris on this? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=432.2s)]
*  And should we be trusting the Biden administration on whatever efforts it says it's taking around [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=434.71999999999997s)]
*  that money? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=440.88s)]
*  Do you believe that there's a quiet agreement? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=441.88s)]
*  I don't trust them. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=446.2s)]
*  I mean, I think there is a quiet agreement in exchange for the six billion. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=447.36s)]
*  They said that they would self in a self regulatory way of going back to 60 percent enrichment [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=452.64s)]
*  just on their own voluntarily. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=457.6s)]
*  I mean, this is most naive foreign policy or they're just being downright, you know, [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=458.92s)]
*  disingenuous, which is the lack of trust here. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=464.64s)]
*  The reason why I don't trust them is the reason why I'm introducing this bill to make sure [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=468.6s)]
*  that it's permanent. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=473.72s)]
*  I think there's enough votes in the Senate to get this done. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=474.72s)]
*  And if anything, Maria, it's going to put a heck of a lot of pressure on the administration [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=477.92s)]
*  to stop this nonsense. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=481.72s)]
*  We don't need to be sending six billion dollars into Iran for God's sakes. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=483.52000000000004s)]
*  After what they just did to Israel, I think that is just egregious. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=487.36s)]
*  Congressman, real quick, connect the dots to China, because I know you've spoken a lot [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=491.56s)]
*  about the aggressiveness coming out of communist China. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=496.04s)]
*  Does China support Iran? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=499.6s)]
*  Oh, of course. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=500.84000000000003s)]
*  I mean, China supports Putin. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=503.84000000000003s)]
*  They both support Iran in the Aitola. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=507.20000000000005s)]
*  China and Russia want to be their narrative is we're helping the Palestinians and the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=510.72s)]
*  Arab nations against the little Satan, the occupier Israel and against the bigger Satan, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=516.76s)]
*  the United States. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=522.4s)]
*  That's essentially their narrative. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=523.48s)]
*  And both Mr. Putin and China are both involved in this. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=525.56s)]
*  In fact, Hamas representatives were just in Moscow just a couple of weeks ago. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=528.64s)]
*  God knows what they were talking about before the invasion, but they're all complicit in [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=534.28s)]
*  this. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=538.72s)]
*  They're all in bed together. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=539.72s)]
*  China, Russia, Iran. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=540.72s)]
*  And we don't want to see this escalate to that level. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=543.48s)]
*  But that is the real picture. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=547.28s)]
*  It sounds like you expect this escalation to happen. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=549.72s)]
*  I think the Hezbollah one will as soon as Israel goes into Gaza. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=554.5600000000001s)]
*  That's the nightmare scenario. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=560.2s)]
*  And I talked about the situation room is how can Hezbollah not go in when these the narratives [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=561.2s)]
*  come out? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=567.08s)]
*  Hamas is very good at propaganda, as you've seen, and they're going to blame all this [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=568.08s)]
*  on Israel, even though they took the they drew first blood. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=571.32s)]
*  They were the ones that went in to this massacre 9-11 style. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=574.44s)]
*  It's their fault, not Israel's. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=578.44s)]
*  But when Israel responds, they get blamed for it. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=580.32s)]
*  And then Hezbollah gets involved with all the rockets. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=582.32s)]
*  And then if Iran gets in there, then we're talking about issues of war and peace. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  Congressman, thank you. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=590.84s)]
*  We're going to be watching and your leadership is so important right now. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=591.84s)]
*  We appreciate your time. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=594.44s)]
*  Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman, Congressman Michael McCaul. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=595.44s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I89ZU6Lh4lE&t=598.6400000000001s)]
