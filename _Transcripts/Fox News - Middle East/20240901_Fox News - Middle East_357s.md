# Israel expands counterterrorism ops in Gaza, West Bank
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg)
*  Heavy fighting is not contained to Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's military is also ramping up the fight against Hamas terrorists in the West Bank. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=14.92s)]
*  At the same time, the IDF continues to hit Hezbollah targets near Israel's northern border [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=19.080000000000002s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  The White House says it wants to avoid a wider conflict erupting, but some Republicans say [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=24.94s)]
*  the Biden-Harris administration needs to step up the pressure on Iran and the terrorist [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=30.18s)]
*  groups it supports. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=34.82s)]
*  What the Biden-Harris administration should have done from the beginning is not pressure [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=37.98s)]
*  Israel to restrain its response, but let Israel win from the very outset. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=42.18s)]
*  For 11 months, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris have put more pressure on Israel than they [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=48.22s)]
*  put on Hamas and Iran and Iran's other terror proxies. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=52.66s)]
*  Let's bring in retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General John Tykert. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=57.46s)]
*  Thank you so much for being here, General. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=61.1s)]
*  I want to ask you, what do you make of what the Senator Tom Cotton just said there? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=62.660000000000004s)]
*  What does the Biden-Harris administration need to do now? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=68.02000000000001s)]
*  And do you put some blame on how they've handled this situation? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=70.78s)]
*  Brian, I think that the Biden-Harris administration needs to look themselves in the mirror, because [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=75.30000000000001s)]
*  part of the reason why we continue to see Hamas surviving and hostages now being executed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=80.42s)]
*  is for two reasons. Number one, because the restraint of the Biden-Harris administration [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=87.38s)]
*  has actually prolonged human suffering because it's prevented Israel from winning the war. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=91.66s)]
*  And that means that Palestinians and those hostages have been suffering. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=97.06s)]
*  And then going back to March and those red line comments from President Biden about Ra'at [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=101.34s)]
*  has now provided top cover to the Hamas terrorists, and they've walked away from ever negotiating position. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=105.86s)]
*  And unfortunately, those same comments have undercut the negotiating position of Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=112.1s)]
*  And so in part, that human suffering of both the hostages and the Palestinians is something [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  that we are complicit in because of the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=121.66s)]
*  We have seen the reporting from Trey Yanks. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=124.7s)]
*  We're seeing the images coming out of Israel right now. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=126.53999999999999s)]
*  A ton of pressure on Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=128.78s)]
*  You have the Defense Minister of Israel, Yoav Gelandt, who is warning here that if a ceasefire strike deal is not complete, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=131.98s)]
*  that this could be a situation where there is an imminent deterioration into a multi-front war. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=140.98s)]
*  What does Benjamin Netanyahu need to do now? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=147.14s)]
*  It has been a constant struggle in Israel to balance their two primary objectives, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=151.78s)]
*  which is to secure the release of the hostages, but at the same time, destroy Hamas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=157.3s)]
*  So the next round of this type of situation won't include more Israeli hostages. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=162.78s)]
*  What Netanyahu needs to be able to do is show strength supported by the United States to end the war in Gaza by defeating Hamas [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=168.02s)]
*  and then resulting in the return of the hostages while keeping pressure on that surrounding area around Israel [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=175.78s)]
*  that looks to eradicate the Israeli state and to eliminate the Jewish people. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=183.02s)]
*  Seems like the sticking point here is an area of land between Gaza and Egypt. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=187.14s)]
*  Netanyahu wants to put troops there and make sure that they do not give that back to Hamas. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=190.94s)]
*  Do you think at this point, given what we're seeing, that a temporary ceasefire at the very least should be struck here? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=196.14s)]
*  Do you think we're at that moment now, the tipping point, where Netanyahu is finally going to have to get to the table here for a ceasefire, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  even if it's not a lasting one? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=211.38s)]
*  I think that just in the last three weeks, we've seen the Israeli negotiators in Cairo and Doha [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  willing to move a little bit and compromise on some of those underlying issues. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=220.34s)]
*  Unfortunately, Hamas isn't even at the negotiating table directly, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=225.57999999999998s)]
*  and in part because they feel that they have international top cover and specifically top cover from the Biden-Harris administration [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  that is pressuring Israel and not commensurately pressuring Hamas and their Iranian sponsors. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=235.98s)]
*  General, I don't think people quite understand fully, most people, just how this is a multi-front war. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=241.94s)]
*  You have not only the war in Gaza, but you have the counter-terrorism strikes in the West Bank. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=248.58s)]
*  You have increased targets by Israel in Syria, and then you have the situation with Hezbollah right at its border with Lebanon. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=253.34s)]
*  Where do you see the multi-front war now? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=260.62s)]
*  Can you help people understand the breadth of this war and where we go now? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=263.5s)]
*  Brian, essentially since its founding, Israel has been surrounded by adversaries that would look to eradicate them. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=269.58s)]
*  It's the most dangerous neighborhood on the planet, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=276.26s)]
*  and the only way that Israel has been able to remain as a state and protect the Jewish people is through strength, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=279.14s)]
*  and that includes strength that is emboldened by support from the United States of America. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=286.18s)]
*  And anytime the Biden-Harris administration or anyone in our administration does something that undercuts [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=290.18s)]
*  either the capability to respond by Israel to threats or to eliminate the capability that they have via weapons sales or transfers [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=297.14000000000004s)]
*  makes things more dangerous for the Israeli people. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  And right now, as Israel balances the variety of threats that surround them, like you said, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=308.5s)]
*  that they need to show strength like they did a week ago in that preemptive strike against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=314.1s)]
*  And that's the only way to keep Iran and its proxies on their back foot and protect the Israeli people. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=319.62s)]
*  A ton of attention will be on how this administration responds, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  particularly how Vice President Kamala Harris and her statements on this, and very much so, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=328.98s)]
*  how Tel Aviv responds to Benjamin Netanyahu moving forward with these protests. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=334.38s)]
*  Retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General John Tyker, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=338.74s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=343.98s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8WCaWJuDzg&t=344.90000000000003s)]
