*  because we've agreed to relift to relieve sanctions and gave them a list of [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=198.06s)]
*  demands in order for them to abide by for us to continue to keep sanctions off [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=202.78s)]
*  yeah it was one of the historic moments of this tremendous trip in which you had [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=209.94s)]
*  the president meeting with the new leader of Syria which goes to tell you [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=214.66s)]
*  that the president wants something to change in this region this is a region [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=218.82s)]
*  often overlooked they just throw money at this region and look the other way [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=222.78s)]
*  and what do you see you see blood all over the sands the president wants to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  make sure that we bring economic partnership and prosperity to the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=231.18s)]
*  Middle East if we do that you're going to see peace flourish throughout the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=234.54s)]
*  entire world by talking to the Syrian leader the president wants to extend a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=237.78s)]
*  hand out to say I am willing to work with you if you're willing to work with [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=242.5s)]
*  us we of course are going to be maintaining our peace through strength [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=245.7s)]
*  objectives here when it comes to our foreign policy but this was a historic [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=249.45999999999998s)]
*  first step to make sure that we can give Syria a chance to change decades if not [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=253.14s)]
*  centuries of struggles in that country and the president is here to make sure [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=258.62s)]
*  that we establish peace across the globe I had to tough for it's a tough move [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=263.74s)]
*  because you know 18 months ago we had a bounty on his head he's one of the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=268.7s)]
*  founding members of news source a form of al-qaeda Islamic extremism but on [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=272.3s)]
*  the on the recommendation the Saudi King as well as as well as Qatar he said why [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=277.14s)]
*  don't you leave some sanctions and give this government a shot so it's not [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=284.62s)]
*  without risk would you agree there's always going to be a risk this is you [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=287.74s)]
*  know foreign policy it gets it gets difficult but this president is going to [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=293.46000000000004s)]
*  make sure that the national security of the United States and of our allies are [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=297.14s)]
*  going to be of utmost importance but if you also look at some of our allies a [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=301.06s)]
*  lot of the Europeans have also taken this risk when it comes to Syria as well [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=305.1s)]
*  so we're going to trust and verify we're going to make sure that the Syrians as [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=308.94s)]
*  well as all the other people in that region are acting in accordance to what [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=312.98s)]
*  they should be doing and another thing that President Trump did when he went [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=317.5s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia is he encouraged them to join the historic Abraham Accords that he [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=320.34000000000003s)]
*  passed in his first term this is what he wants he wants peace and prosperity it's [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=324.54s)]
*  economic diplomacy and it's going to work not just for the region but for the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=328.74s)]
*  United States of America. Real quick it's so many balls are in the air but we [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=333.06s)]

*  called his bluff and doesn't look like Putin showing up he's not even say even [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=346.44s)]
*  sending his foreign minister is that a personal affront to President Trump who [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=349.86s)]
*  recommended Zelensky go? It would be a disappointing development there's no [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=353.58s)]
*  doubt about it but the president has been rock-solid in his commitment to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=359.65999999999997s)]

*  White House he's spoken to Putin he wants this war to end once and for all [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=366.64s)]
*  but we also have to remember how we got here we had an incompetent president and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=370.26s)]
*  Joe Biden who allowed this war to happen this war would have never happened if [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=373.97999999999996s)]
*  President Trump was our 46th president United States when President Trump was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=377.78s)]
*  in his first term he gave the Ukrainians javelins when Obama gave them [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxfg2kS88H8&t=383.38s)]
