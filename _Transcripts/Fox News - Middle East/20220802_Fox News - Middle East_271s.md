# Pompeo warns of China's takedown of Taiwan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 02, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q)
*  With that, we want to bring in Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State and CIA Director [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=0.0s)]
*  and Fox News contributor. Secretary, good to have you with us as always. Thank you for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=4.24s)]
*  joining us today. You've been watching this along with us. What would you like to say about what [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=8.08s)]
*  John Kirby just said and what you're hearing in there? Well, he got some things right and some [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=12.88s)]
*  things not quite right. He was right. The strike on Zawahiri was important. He was a bad guy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=18.88s)]
*  It's a kudos to the intelligence community during my time and now after a lot of work done to get [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=24.32s)]
*  him and take him off the battlefield. It is a righteous strike against a horrible man who [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=29.44s)]
*  killed lots of Americans. Second, it's good that we demonstrated we could conduct a strike without [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=32.72s)]
*  troops on the ground. That's good stuff. But the overstatement is that we still have the [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=37.36s)]
*  depth and capacity of intelligence that we had before we left. And that's certainly not the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=41.84s)]
*  case in the way that we rolled out of there. Second, with respect to the Taliban, I was in [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=46.32s)]
*  the middle of the discussions with the Taliban. We never trusted them. They continued to violate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=52.16s)]
*  the agreement when we were in office. And for that reason, we never got everybody out. We knew [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=56.96s)]
*  that they weren't honoring the commitments that they'd made under the Doha agreement. And so we [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=61.2s)]
*  didn't do what President Biden chose to do. They knew, this administration knew that they were [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=64.4s)]
*  violating the agreements and chose to leave. And the risk is therefore heightened. So President [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=68.48s)]
*  Biden has said that Afghanistan will never be a safe haven for terror, that he will not allow that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=73.04s)]
*  to happen. Does he have the ability to do that given our lack of footprint there and even [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=78.64s)]
*  understanding and respecting the over-the-horizon strength that we did see demonstrated here? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=85.52s)]
*  Boy, it's difficult to do anywhere, to make such a blanket statement, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=92.64s)]
*  you say you're not going to let some place be a haven. The question is always about how much [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=95.44s)]
*  resource and how much risk can you take down? And there's no doubt because the Taliban have failed [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=99.68s)]
*  to live up to the commitments that they made, the risk is greater today than it was a year ago when [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=104.88s)]
*  we had the debacle of the departure from Afghanistan. I don't think there's any doubt [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  about that. There's more risk there today, Martha. Yeah. He said if the Taliban wants [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=113.28s)]
*  in a relationship, they should look at what we did. I'm not sure that there's room there for a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=117.2s)]
*  relationship anymore at this point, but we'll see what they do there. The next big push will be about [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=121.28s)]
*  money, Martha. They're going to need a bunch of money and we should make sure we don't give them [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=127.12s)]
*  a nickel. Yeah. Well, we've seen those kind of exchanges in the past and we'll see what they [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=130.08s)]
*  decide to do here. I want to ask you about the large picture in terms of China. You look at this [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=135.2s)]
*  as former CIA director, former secretary of state. What's the impact of this Pelosi trip? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=140.8s)]
*  And what do you read into the reaction to it? Does it move us or does it move Taiwan closer [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=145.84s)]
*  to a more dangerous situation? And do you think that China is planning an invasion? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=151.52s)]
*  Martha, I don't think there's any doubt that Xi Jinping is intent on taking Taiwan. He calls [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  it reunification. We know that it is the destruction and the violation of the sovereignty of an [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=163.44s)]
*  independent nation. Even Kirby used the language says we still need to defend Taiwan, even though [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=167.28s)]
*  he went wobbly when he talked about the history there. The Chinese are a bit tiresome on this, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=172.0s)]
*  Martha, I'll be honest with you. They overreact to silly things like a visit from a parliamentarian, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=177.76s)]
*  from a free nation and threaten all kinds of silly stuff. We shouldn't be on defense here. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=182.16s)]
*  We're doing the right thing. Speaker Pelosi did the right thing by traveling there after we were [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=187.2s)]
*  threatened and not letting the Chinese Communist Party bully us. I think Xi Jinping's plans didn't [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=191.44s)]
*  change one iota because of Speaker Pelosi's visit. I think his plans remain the same. He may [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=196.32s)]
*  use this as a pretext to mess around for a while. What we can't do is be on defense. We have to take [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=200.88s)]
*  a series of actions that demonstrate real American resolve. And if we do those things, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=206.0s)]
*  we can push back against the CCP's threats, not only on Taiwan, but here in our homeland as well. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=209.92s)]
*  Just have 20 seconds, but I thought it was interesting. John Kirby said we will continue [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  to manage what Beijing decides to do, roughly. That's not verbat, but roughly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=218.16s)]
*  Yeah, that's backwards. It should be the Chinese Communist Party that fears what America will do, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=224.48s)]
*  that it fears American strength, economic power from the United States of America, something that [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=229.04s)]
*  can put the Chinese Communist Party at enormous risk. We should support the Chinese people. We [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=232.72s)]
*  should pressure the Chinese Communist Party and we can convince them not to behave in the very [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  ways we've seen them behave these last handful of days, Martha. Secretary Pompeo, always good to [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=240.48s)]
*  have you with us. Thank you very much, sir. Thank you, Martha. Have a great afternoon. Yes, ma'am. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Gs3lVBLD2Q&t=245.35999999999999s)]
