# Trump’s decision could bring ‘SEISMIC CHANGE’ to the Mid-East: Ben Hall
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc)
*  Let's go now to Fox News senior correspondent, Benjamin Hall. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, so Benjamin, you've survived wars. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=3.0s)]
*  What does your gut tell you? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=6.8s)]
*  You know, Jesse, it's fascinating to watch this right now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=10.72s)]
*  The whole world is watching what President Trump is about to do. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=13.16s)]
*  And just seeing him standing at the White House earlier on, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=16.16s)]
*  keeping everyone guessing, not making that move too quickly is fascinating. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Look, I think it's fair to say that there are incredible pros [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=22.72s)]
*  for hitting that nuclear site and incredible cons, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=26.28s)]
*  as well. The pros you laid out earlier. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=29.88s)]
*  Look, you get rid of Iran's nuclear facility. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=31.96s)]
*  That the US is the only country that can do that. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=34.6s)]
*  That perhaps leads to a change in regime. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  As you said, the country is falling apart. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=39.76s)]
*  People are striking. People can't afford to live. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=41.76s)]
*  That could change the whole Middle East with President Trump's relationships [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=44.2s)]
*  with Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=47.84s)]
*  If the Iranian regime was to fall, you could change the region. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  You could pull them away from China, pull them away from Russia. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=53.68s)]
*  It could be a geopolitical shock if that would have happened. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=56.68s)]
*  It would be a seismic change. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  On the other hand, there are potential real negatives. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=62.519999999999996s)]
*  And that is down to how Iran will respond. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=65.88s)]
*  Look, if Iran was to go after American embassies, American [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=68.52s)]
*  ships, American bases and Americans were killed, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=75.12s)]
*  it would quickly lead to escalation. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=78.64s)]
*  America would have to get involved further and further. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=80.36s)]
*  If they shut the Straits of Hormuz, the oil prices rise. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=82.88s)]
*  If they use their countless terror proxies around the world, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=86.16s)]
*  we could see an outbreak. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=89.48s)]
*  So President Trump right now is balancing the two. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=90.48s)]
*  But even if the US didn't want to get involved with this before Israel started, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=93.4s)]
*  the thinking is that when Iran, if Iran is now given a chance, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=97.88s)]
*  they will rush for a bomb. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=101.84s)]
*  It is the only way they can do so. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=103.08s)]
*  The delays on their nuclear program at the moment may be around two years. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=105.16s)]
*  It'll be five plus years if that facility is hit. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=108.92s)]
*  And that is a big difference. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=111.76s)]
*  And so President Trump, muddling this up. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  Do you stand alongside your ally, Israel, or do you perhaps pull back [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=115.56s)]
*  and hope for some diplomatic way of this finishing? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=120.19999999999999s)]
*  That, it appears, is not likely. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=123.19999999999999s)]
*  And many people feeling it won't be long till the president makes a decision [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=125.28s)]
*  to perhaps go after Fordu nuclear base. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=128.76s)]
*  Benjamin, could you see a scenario where we did use the bunker [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=131.76s)]
*  busters on Fordow and the Ayatollah stayed in power? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=136.2s)]
*  I look it's a fascinating question. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=143.12s)]
*  This is the big question. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=144.6s)]
*  I think everyone knows that regime change is not going to come forcefully, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=145.6s)]
*  that you have to put in place [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=148.72s)]
*  that to happen domestically inside Iran. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=151.84s)]
*  And those things are already happening. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=154.28s)]
*  But look, they've taken away the leadership of the military. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=155.68s)]
*  And many people say, yes, the Ayatollah is the supreme leader, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=158.72s)]
*  but actually it is the IRGC, the Revolutionary Guard. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=161.95999999999998s)]
*  They're the ones that have controlled the country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=164.56s)]
*  If you take those out, and many of them have already been gone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=166.48s)]
*  If you take out the Ayatollah or some of the mullahs, which Israel might do, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=169.2s)]
*  then that leaves a huge vacuum. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=172.76s)]
*  But the question is, who fills the gap? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=174.12s)]
*  There is no real opposition leader in Iran at the moment. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=176.36s)]
*  You know, in Russia, you had the Navalny. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=179.56s)]
*  Well, Russia killed Navalny and they've done the same in Iran. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=181.32s)]
*  They have killed all the opposition leaders. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=184.16s)]
*  And so who could lead the way after that? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=186.52s)]
*  You have the Shah's son who lives in Virginia, Reza Pahlavi, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  who is supporting the Israeli moves. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=191.96s)]
*  And he is saying he would come to Iran. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=194.08s)]
*  He would bring them towards democracy. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=195.88s)]
*  But again, many Iranians outside Iran support it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=197.8s)]
*  Many Iranians inside Iran, not so much. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=200.20000000000002s)]
*  They don't like the idea of a king. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=202.92s)]
*  So who fills the gap? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=204.11999999999998s)]
*  Does it become another hardline militant or does it become democracy? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  And again, another big question in which direction Iran would go. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=210.2s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think they're going to accept the Shah's son. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=213.88s)]
*  That's probably not something that they're going to stomach. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=216.27999999999997s)]
*  But would it be better if there was just kind of a hardline military guy [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=219.11999999999998s)]
*  that kind of kept the country together, but he was defanged, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=227.04s)]
*  you know, limited ballistic missiles. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=231.08s)]
*  The Iranian National Guard wasn't playing any games outside the borders [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=233.72s)]
*  and the nuclear facilities were completely decimated. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=237.88s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to see someone in the military who could play that role. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=243.8s)]
*  I've spoken to so many Iranians over the last week, people inside Iran. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=246.84s)]
*  It is the military that they can't stand. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=250.52s)]
*  If there's going to be a change, a positive change, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=252.36s)]
*  it has to be away from the military. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=254.56s)]
*  So, no, I'm not certain that's the case. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=256.8s)]
*  I think that it would have to be the people rising up. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=258.84s)]
*  You know, in 2009, we saw the Green Revolution, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people on the streets. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=265.08s)]
*  We saw it in 2022, hundreds of thousands of people on the streets. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=266.71999999999997s)]
*  There is a movement in Iran. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=270.56s)]
*  80% of the country want change. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=272.28s)]
*  You look back to pre-1979, you saw this democratic movement, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=274.64s)]
*  not democratic, it was under the Shah, but you saw a freedom movement [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=278.32s)]
*  where people at least had some sort of free say. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=281.2s)]
*  So, no, it can't seem to be a military leader that's going to take over. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=283.91999999999996s)]
*  Benjamin, you know, you hear things like freedom [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=287.88s)]
*  and you hear things like, you know, the people are going to rise up. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=291.68s)]
*  And we've seen this before. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=294.88s)]
*  I mean, a lot of the times it could take never, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=296.12s)]
*  it could take decades, and you could just have a power vacuum [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=299.56s)]
*  where the people with the guns have the power and the people [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=303.2s)]
*  without the guns have nothing. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=305.88s)]
*  And then you're looking at a failed state. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=307.92s)]
*  Is that I mean, that's obviously something to consider. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=311.12s)]
*  Well, it is. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=314.48s)]
*  And if you look at who's running Syria at the moment, it's Shahra, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=315.0s)]
*  who himself was, you know, at one point working alongside Al Qaeda. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=317.96s)]
*  And sometimes those perhaps are the people who fill in, who come in. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=321.8s)]
*  We don't know who those people are in Iran because the opposition [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=325.32s)]
*  has been so silenced. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=328.76s)]
*  But yes, does it become a failed state after this? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=330.04s)]
*  Well, I would argue it is already a failed state. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=332.72s)]
*  It is a totally failed state. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=334.88s)]
*  So would the would the opportunity of bringing in another military leader [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=336.2s)]
*  would perhaps be the opportunity of bringing in one of the current diplomats [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=341.72s)]
*  who has worked, you know, liaising with the US over the last few years? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=344.56s)]
*  Would that be a better option? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=347.8s)]
*  We don't know. But I think it comes down to the fact that right now [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=349.16s)]
*  the decision has to be made on whether or not Iran can build a nuclear weapon, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=352.12s)]
*  whether it's on that path. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=356.76s)]
*  You know, you can look time and time again about what comes next. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  But unless you deal with that initial issue, that initial problem, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=361.64000000000004s)]
*  which the IAEA, they said Iran was breaking all the rules just two weeks ago. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=365.44s)]
*  Iran themselves said that they were opening a third enrichment site [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fl7PFsWz8Rc&t=370.04s)]
