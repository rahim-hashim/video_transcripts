# Netanyahu speaks on whether Israel's neighbors are quietly supporting it
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ)
*  Am I right or wrong that a lot of the Arab nations are rooting for Israel? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=0.0s)]
*  That is, they want nothing to do with Iran, they want nothing to do with Iran's surrogates, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=6.42s)]
*  they want nothing to do honestly with taking Palestinians, but I noticed when the fighting [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=10.68s)]
*  began and everything, they didn't join in to help Iran or Hezbollah or anybody else [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=15.72s)]
*  for that matter. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=21.36s)]
*  I don't want you to reveal anything that's secret, obviously, but I get the feeling that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=22.36s)]
*  a lot of these countries are rooting for you, no? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=26.8s)]
*  What is said publicly and what is said privately are two different things, obviously. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=31.36s)]
*  But they understand. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=36.760000000000005s)]
*  Look, I've noticed this change already before the Abraham Accords. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  I mean, I saw that the Arab world had undergone a fundamental change. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=41.36s)]
*  They recognize that their enemy is not Israel, but Israel is really their ally against their [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=46.019999999999996s)]
*  real enemy, which is Iran and its various proxies. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=50.6s)]
*  They get it. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=54.82s)]
*  They got it. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=55.84s)]
*  That's how we got the Abraham Accords. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=56.84s)]
*  We just needed somebody to broker it, finish the job, which is what President Trump did. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=57.84s)]
*  It's the same thing now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=63.38s)]
*  They understand that the threat is Iran and its proxies, much wounded, much diminished, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=66.18s)]
*  some of them decimated, but the equation hasn't changed. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=72.53999999999999s)]
*  But of course, I won't quote this or that leader. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=75.78s)]
*  I'll give them their space for deniability. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=78.22s)]
*  You mentioned civilian casualties. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=81.02s)]
*  We've had expert after expert, John Spencer, the man from West Point, who's an expert on [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=83.82s)]
*  these issues, that the Israeli military has done more than any military in the history [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=89.69999999999999s)]
*  record keeping to protect civilians of an enemy country or enemy entity. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=95.82s)]
*  And yet they keep their propaganda going. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=103.58s)]
*  Hamas does. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=105.82s)]
*  The New York Times uses it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=106.82s)]
*  CNN uses it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=108.22s)]
*  They use it all over the world. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=109.22s)]
*  I mean, that's got to be so frustrating because I think this helps drive the anti-Semitism, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=110.5s)]
*  no? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=115.17999999999999s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=116.17999999999999s)]
*  And it's a web of lies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=117.17999999999999s)]
*  For example, they declared me in this kangaroo court called the ICC, they declared me a war [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=118.94s)]
*  criminal. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=126.66s)]
*  And what am I charged with? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=127.66s)]
*  That we deliberately starve the population of Gaza, which is completely false. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=130.34s)]
*  We gave instructions early on not only to get them out of harm's way, but also to supply [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=135.78s)]
*  humanitarian supplies like food, water, whatever. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=140.38s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=144.62s)]
*  We took thousands, thousands of Palestinian Hamas prisoners. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=147.29999999999998s)]
*  You know what the first thing you do when you take a Palestinian Hamas prisoner? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=152.38s)]
*  You want to make sure that he doesn't have an explosive belt on his suicide belt. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=158.18s)]
*  So you ask them to take their shirts off. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=165.82s)]
*  And now we have photos of thousands of these prisoners who have, you know, without their [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=169.86s)]
*  shirt. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=177.06s)]
*  And you will not find one, not one, emaciated. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=178.06s)]
*  In fact, you find quite a few who are overweight because they eat, because there's no starvation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=181.38000000000002s)]
*  And also they don't exercise, you know. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=187.38000000000002s)]
*  You don't get much exercise in the tunnels, like these terror tunnels that they build. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=188.74s)]
*  So this is completely false. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=196.5s)]
*  These charges in the press are outrageous. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=197.54s)]
*  And when they come from the International Criminal Court, it's outrageous, not only [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=199.86s)]
*  because they compare Israel, a democratic country which has the highest standards of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=203.46s)]
*  fighting just war with just means, and they compare us to this monstrous terrorist organization [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=209.14s)]
*  of Hamas. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=216.58s)]
*  It's not only because of that. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=217.58s)]
*  It's outrageous because the charges are false. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=220.26s)]
*  So you've got this assault coming in from lawfare on the one side, international lawfare, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=223.78s)]
*  and the other side international media, American media. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=229.5s)]
*  It's outrageous. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=232.46s)]
*  I just met with a group of leading American journalists and I said, you know, it's your [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=233.46s)]
*  job to get to the facts. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=239.82s)]
*  You can't buy this nonsense. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5SieEGaMQaQ&t=241.58s)]
