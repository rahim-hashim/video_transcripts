# Nikki Haley: This all started with the debacle in Afghanistan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE)
*  All right, Joe Biden's weakness on the world stage now is making America less safe. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, Iran, they issued a warning on Thursday that a proposed U.S.-backed task force to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  protect ships in the Red Sea would cause, quote, an extraordinary problems in the region. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=11.26s)]
*  Now, the latest threat comes after the U.S. destroyer had to shoot down yet another Houthi [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=17.2s)]
*  drone over the Red Sea yesterday. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=23.36s)]
*  And again, we ask a simple question. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=25.66s)]
*  Is Joe Biden ever, ever going to forcefully respond to unprovoked attacks like these? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=27.38s)]
*  Now, given his disastrous track record, I don't think I'd hold my breath. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=34.58s)]
*  Anyway, meanwhile, in the administration's latest show of wavering support for Israel, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=38.620000000000005s)]
*  according to Axios, all-National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan is now telling Israeli [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=43.34s)]
*  Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu that the, quote, high-intensity phase of the Gaza War needs [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  to end within weeks. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=54.63999999999999s)]
*  However, the Biden administration, they are pushing back on the report, saying Sullivan [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  did not give a timeline. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=60.279999999999994s)]
*  And yet another report saying Vice President Kamala Harris is pushing the White House to [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=62.559999999999995s)]
*  be more sympathetic to the Palestinians. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=66.82s)]
*  Here with reaction, 2024 presidential candidate Nikki Haley. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=70.08s)]
*  You know, maybe I'm old-fashioned governor, ambassador, but I will tell you, if you're [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=73.32s)]
*  going to be involved in any conflict or any war, you should have one aim. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  I will quote Winston Churchill. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=84.4s)]
*  Victory, victory at all costs against a monstrous tyranny. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=86.56s)]
*  Wouldn't that fit here? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=91.4s)]
*  Why would Joe Biden be lecturing Israel on how to fight and win their war? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  For them, it's a war of survival. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  Sean, this is why none of our enemies fear us, is because they see exactly what Biden [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=100.4s)]
*  does. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=106.56s)]
*  He did this with Ukraine. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=107.56s)]
*  Now he's doing it with Israel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=108.56s)]
*  Either you're a friend or you're not. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=109.56s)]
*  And why are you taking the side of Hamas as opposed to Israel? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=111.84s)]
*  If you say you're going to be with Israel and support Israel, then do that. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=116.12s)]
*  But you don't start drawing conditions on what they can and can't do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  This was a country that fell to her knees with the worst attacks since the Holocaust. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=124.22s)]
*  And now they're trying to eliminate Hamas, the ones that did this, which, by the way, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=129.6s)]
*  should be personal for America, because 33 Americans were butchered on that day. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=134.2s)]
*  We've got American hostages. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=139.7s)]
*  Let them finish the job. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=141.64s)]
*  Let them finish Hamas once and for all. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=143.2s)]
*  Stop telling them what they can and can't do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  And stop worrying about whether Hamas and the people of Gaza are okay. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=148.11999999999998s)]
*  And start worrying about what are we really going to do to protect the security of Israel, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=153.14s)]
*  which, by the way, protects the security of America. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=159.44s)]
*  Maybe it's me, but I would say if Israel wants to have full victory, they need to prevent [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=160.44s)]
*  again being a launching pad for rockets into their neighboring cities. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=167.16s)]
*  I think victory has to be defined by ending that network of terror tunnels. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=172.32s)]
*  Victory has to be defined by preventing Lebanon and Hezbollah from firing missiles using Lebanon [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=178.6s)]
*  as a launching pad into Israel, firing rockets and missiles. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=185.16s)]
*  And I would also say if they want full victory, somebody's going to have to, at some point, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=189.2s)]
*  deal with Iran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=193.46s)]
*  The way I would deal with Iran, nobody's asking my opinion. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=194.46s)]
*  I would take out every refinery they have that would cut back on their money supply. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=197.5s)]
*  And if possible, somebody, at some point, they better take out those nuclear sites before [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=202.66s)]
*  Iran, married with their sick ideology, were ever to get a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=208.3s)]
*  Would you agree with that? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=212.78s)]
*  Sean, I mean, you have to look at the fact that Iran decided years ago, and they've been [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=213.78s)]
*  very good at it, at using their proxies rather than doing things themselves. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  There would be no Houthis without Iran. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=224.38s)]
*  There would not be Hamas without Iran. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=226.12s)]
*  There would not be Hezbollah without Iran. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=228.57999999999998s)]
*  So they're using their proxies to do their dirty work. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=230.56s)]
*  But if we really want to do something, why doesn't Joe Biden go back and put the sanctions [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  down on Iran that were already there? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=239.16s)]
*  Why are you letting billions of dollars flow to Iran from China, who's importing all of [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=241.96s)]
*  their oil? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=246.3s)]
*  Why are you continuing to talk about an Iran deal, when all that does is show weakness? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=247.44s)]
*  And why not go after those in Syria and Iraq that continue to hit our military men and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=252.36s)]
*  women, hit their infrastructure in Syria and Iraq, give them one big punch, and they will [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=257.40000000000003s)]
*  step back? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=262.68s)]
*  But right now, they don't fear us. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  And that all started with the debacle in Afghanistan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=266.64s)]
*  It went on with Ukraine. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=269.8s)]
*  I mean, you see what happened there. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=271.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, first of all, the fact that Hamas invaded Israel on Putin's birthday, that was [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=272.96000000000004s)]
*  a gift to Putin. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=279.64s)]
*  There's a reason he is the happiest man in the world, because what happened? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=281.36s)]
*  Basically, U.S. and the West took their eyes off of Ukraine and put their eyes on Israel. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=285.52s)]
*  And so now Putin's hoping this is the moment he can take Ukraine and go into Poland and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=292.04s)]
*  the Baltics, and then we are at war. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=296.28s)]
*  This is about preventing war. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=298.48s)]
*  And Biden is failing on the job miserably and making the world less safe. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  I would like to see America, and I know you were the U.N. ambassador. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=304.76s)]
*  I don't trust these globalist organizations anymore. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=309.48s)]
*  Historically, they have been anti-American and they have been anti-Semitic. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=312.96s)]
*  I talked to you about this. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=316.36s)]
*  I don't trust the World Health Organization. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=317.52s)]
*  They were basically propagandists for China on the issue of COVID. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=320.2s)]
*  I don't trust the WEF. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=325.52s)]
*  I don't trust the Paris Accords that we're a part of. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=327.24s)]
*  And I feel like any time we get involved in these globalist organizations, it ends up [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=330.6s)]
*  badly for the U.S. and we end up paying billions and billions of dollars that we can't afford. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=335.48s)]
*  Does this need to stop? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=342.24s)]
*  Should America now retreat from some of these globalist organizations? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=343.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, and we need to go and show exactly what we mean when we do that. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=348.0s)]
*  It's the reason that we got out of the Paris climate agreement when I was at the U.N. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  It's the reason we got out of the Human Rights Council. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=357.44s)]
*  It's the reason we stopped any taxpayer dollars going to the Palestinian refugee organization. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=359.70000000000005s)]
*  We absolutely should get out of the World Health Organization and anything that the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=365.12s)]
*  U.N. is doing. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=369.32s)]
*  Look at how they failed at looking at the human rights abuses of what has happened to [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=370.32s)]
*  the women on October 7th. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=375.6s)]
*  They're nowhere to be found. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=378.12s)]
*  They continue to show themselves to be a farce. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=379.64s)]
*  We should defund the U.N. as much as possible and let them know that until they start to [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=382.16s)]
*  become legitimate, we're not going to sit there and put any more money into it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=387.16s)]
*  Because right now what's happening is China's winning with these organizations, Russia's [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=392.88s)]
*  winning with these organizations, and no one is putting a stop to what they're doing. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=396.04s)]
*  It's because they smell weakness. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=400.28s)]
*  It's because they smell blood. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=401.96s)]
*  America has lost its footing. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=404.0s)]
*  We can get it back. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=405.28s)]
*  We can get it back, but it comes with American strength. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=406.68s)]
*  American strength always prevents wars and gets the world to be more at peace. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=410.44s)]
*  We've got to go back to that. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=415.24s)]
*  Last question. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=416.68s)]
*  Governor DeSantis was on this program last night. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=417.68s)]
*  He wants to debate you one on one right here on this program. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=420.36s)]
*  What would your answer be? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=423.24s)]
*  Well, I've debated him four times. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=424.24s)]
*  I love debates. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=427.8s)]
*  I have no issue with that. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=428.8s)]
*  But quite honestly, Sean, the person I want to debate is Donald Trump. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=430.16s)]
*  If you can get him on your show, that's who I want to debate. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=433.36s)]
*  That's who we're looking at. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=436.36s)]
*  That's who's, you know, we're second place in Iowa, second place in New Hampshire, second [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HChsTVTeDyE&t=437.36s)]
