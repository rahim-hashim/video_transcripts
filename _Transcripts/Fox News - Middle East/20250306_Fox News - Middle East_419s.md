# Trump issues unprecedented warning to Hamas: Israel will 'finish the job'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I)
*  Let's get right to Lucas Tomlinson with a big announcement for the auto industry. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=0.0s)]
*  Well good early morning Carly and Todd. If you're in the auto industry or planning to buy a car, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=5.36s)]
*  you just received some good news. The Trump administration announcing [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=9.68s)]
*  tariffs in the auto industry will be delayed. We spoke with the big three auto dealers. We are [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  going to give a one-month exemption on any autos coming through USMCA. Reciprocal tariffs will [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=19.52s)]
*  still go into effect on April 2nd, but at the request of the companies associated with USMCA, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=26.48s)]
*  the president is giving them an exemption for one month so they are not at an economic disadvantage. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  As you mentioned off the top Carly, President Trump not as generous when it comes to Hamas [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=39.2s)]
*  demanding the release of the 59 remaining Israeli hostages from Gaza. Dozens are believed to be dead. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=43.36s)]
*  Trump posting on Truth Social, release all the hostages now, not later, and immediately return [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=49.44s)]
*  all the dead bodies of the people you murdered or it is over for you. I am sending Israel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=55.76s)]
*  everything it needs to finish the job. Now yesterday Trump met with eight hostages released [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=60.72s)]
*  from Gaza who told the president of the Oval Office they didn't think they'd be free without his [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=65.67999999999999s)]
*  return to the White House. Were you all taken to Roktova? Yes. So this was hell. It was the worst [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=70.24s)]
*  thing that anybody could go through. I was moved 33 times, spent time in tunnels with no air to [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  breathe, barely food, hardly any water, and I am so grateful and thankful to be here because of [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=83.92s)]
*  President Trump. We are here because of you. We are alive and free because of you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=92.08s)]
*  Trump administration has been holding direct talks with Hamas for the first time in an attempt to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=98.56s)]
*  free the remaining hostages. Carly Todd. Lucas, thank you. Let's pick it up there with New Jersey [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=103.04s)]
*  Congressman Jeff Van Drew. Congressman, these talks are unprecedented. The U.S. has never [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=108.16s)]
*  engaged directly with Hamas. Will it work? I think there's a real opportunity here and I think it [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=113.11999999999999s)]
*  will work. Again, you know, peace through strength, war through weakness. We've had four years of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=121.2s)]
*  weakness. Now we're being strong. The president has made it clear and it's the sense of the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  majority of Congress clearly that we are dealing with the face of evil, that we have to be strong, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=132.48s)]
*  and that they better release these hostages and these bodies immediately or if not there's going [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=138.16s)]
*  to be hell to pay. There's no in-between here and the president's correct. We need to get let Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=143.92s)]
*  do what it needs to do to win this thing. You know, in the past four years, we always put Netanyahu's [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=149.12s)]
*  arm behind his back. We didn't let him to go in there full throttle. Now we have a president that's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=155.44s)]
*  going to go full throttle. We're going to get them released and we're going to move forward. And if [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=160.64s)]
*  they don't, there will be hell to pay. And I believe the United States will go after each [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  and every one of Hamas until they are wiped from the face of the earth. We will certainly be [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  watching. Meantime, the White House putting Democrats on blast for their disgraceful showing [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=176.4s)]
*  at President Trump's joint address. Listen to this. The behavior of Democrats last night was [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  completely disgraceful and demonstrated how severely out of touch they are with the American [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=186.32000000000002s)]
*  public. It was the most shameful moment in the history of presidential addresses in that [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=192.08s)]
*  beautiful chamber. The Democrats exposed themselves as the party of insanity and hate, the party that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=198.16000000000003s)]
*  wants to put America last. Congressman, I think Reince Priebus said a pest on Hannity last night [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=204.4s)]
*  when he said, look, the RNC could not have paid for the damage that Democrats did to themselves [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=209.92000000000002s)]
*  during the joint address. What were you thinking as you watched your former party basically [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=216.96s)]
*  implode before our eyes? Well, you know, it's one thing to do political damage to yourself, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=221.84s)]
*  and they did. I mean, it just looked terrible. It was horrible on the world stage. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=228.0s)]
*  But you know what? I just don't understand. When you're honoring children or families or heroes, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=232.88s)]
*  good Americans, I mean, that's something we really should all be able to agree on as much [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=240.72s)]
*  as I disagreed with Joe Biden and many of my colleagues on the left. If they were honoring [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=246.32s)]
*  somebody who was a true American hero or a young kid that went through surgery, I'd stand up and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=252.0s)]
*  I'd clap. Forget about Republican, Democrat, right and left. That's just human. It's just humane. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=257.28s)]
*  It's just American. And they didn't do that. I don't know what to say. And you're right. I mean, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=263.44s)]
*  from a political stance, this is a dream come true for Republicans when you can't stand up and show [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=268.24s)]
*  your appreciation to good Americans. I don't know what the hell can you do? And, Congressman, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=275.2s)]
*  you know it's bad when even commentators on the left said it was bad. I mean, we're talking about [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=279.68s)]
*  a little child with cancer. We're talking about victims of heinous crimes. You should be able to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=286.64s)]
*  just put partisan politics aside for the moment and show, to your point, a sense of humanity. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=293.2s)]
*  The fact that they couldn't is mind blowing. Finally, before we let you go, Elon Musk holding [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=299.52s)]
*  a closed-door meeting with lawmakers on the House Doge Subcommittee and the House GOP Conference, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=304.56s)]
*  while lawmakers telling Fox News Digital, quote, the executive Doge team is confident they think [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=309.36s)]
*  they can get one trillion dollars. He acknowledged that we're going to make mistakes, but we are going [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=314.64s)]
*  to correct them very quickly. What's your reaction to that number? One trillion dollars, Congressman. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=319.68s)]
*  Is it realistic? I know. I hope it is. And here's the deal with this. There's so much waste. There's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=325.28s)]
*  so much fraud. There's so much abuse. We certainly can save a lot of money. I mean, people really [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=332.32s)]
*  don't want the Taliban using American money to buy, you know, condoms. We don't need to have, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=337.59999999999997s)]
*  you know, transgender opera in Colombia. I can go through the list. We don't want to go through all [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=343.76s)]
*  of it right now. But the bottom line is this. We can save a huge amount of money. We have to work [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=349.52s)]
*  with a scalpel. I say this over and over and again, and I mean it. We have to make sure that [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=354.8s)]
*  we're cutting the things that need to be cut. And there's plenty of it, especially here in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=359.2s)]
*  Washington, D.C. There's so much fat here. We also have to make sure that those services, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=364.47999999999996s)]
*  that those essential things that America does, helping working people who are working poor, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=369.92s)]
*  helping our veterans, helping, you know, make sure that our country is and does rise to all that it [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=375.59999999999997s)]
*  should. We continue to do those. And that's the trick. And yeah, it's going to be a little bumpy. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=381.36s)]
*  And once in a while, mistakes will be made as long as we react quickly. And when a mistake is [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=386.72s)]
*  made, it is corrected quickly. I think we can all, at least most of us who care about America, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  be on board. You can't let perfect be the enemy of the good. That seems to be the message from [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  Elon Musk as well as Congressman Jeff Van Drew. We appreciate you getting up early with us. Thank you, sir. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHBbs6bwF3I&t=402.24s)]
