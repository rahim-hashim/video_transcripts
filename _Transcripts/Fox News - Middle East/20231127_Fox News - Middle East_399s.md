# Sean Hannity: Biden gets bullied at home and abroad
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU)
*  And welcome to Hannity and Buckleup for a big week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=0.0s)]
*  On Thursday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis will square off against California Governor [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=8.68s)]
*  Gavin Newsom for what we're calling a Red State Blue State debate moderated by yours. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=12.8s)]
*  Truly, whatever you might think about Gavin Newsom, you will definitely hear a far more [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=17.8s)]
*  coherent individual than let's say the guy that is living at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=23.1s)]
*  But anyway, it will be a fun debate. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=29.82s)]
*  I hope you'll join us on Thursday night from Georgia. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=31.18s)]
*  Now, today, a very confused, confounded Joe Biden telling voters that the economy is doing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=33.58s)]
*  great in spite of how all of us feel and what we see every single day, telling us prices [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=39.92s)]
*  are down, Americans have more money in their pockets, none of which is true. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=45.94s)]
*  Coming up, we'll break down the latest dismal economic numbers. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=50.74s)]
*  We'll give you the truth, including what is a sharp spike in the cost of food, plus [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=53.66s)]
*  more bad polls for Joe Biden and more panic among the Democrats and the media mob. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=58.72s)]
*  But first tonight breaking, the ceasefire in Gaza has now been extended for two more [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=64.08s)]
*  days after 11 more hostages were freed earlier today, the fourth hostage release. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=68.2s)]
*  So far, Hamas has returned 69 of the roughly 240 people they kidnapped from southern Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=73.68s)]
*  In exchange, Israel has released a whopping 117 Palestinians that are actually in prison, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=80.88s)]
*  including terrorists and violent criminals. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=87.2s)]
*  One such terrorist, who was severely disfigured after detonating a car bomb at a checkpoint, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=89.68s)]
*  was actually given a hero's welcome upon her return. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=95.52000000000001s)]
*  Another terrorist was serving a 13-year prison sentence for attempting to stab Israelis during [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=98.88s)]
*  an attack conducted alongside her cousin. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=104.28s)]
*  In contrast, Hamas freed women, young children, toddlers, who they abducted from their homes [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=107.28s)]
*  after murdering, in many cases, their parents right in front of them. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=113.88s)]
*  Dozens of women and children were held in squalid conditions in Gaza for seven weeks. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=117.8s)]
*  Food we now know is limited. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=123.36s)]
*  Plastic chairs were used as beds. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  Hostages were denied the use of bathrooms for hours on end. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=127.36s)]
*  Many of the hostages lost what is a considerable amount of weight, and some were held in complete [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=130.68s)]
*  darkness for over a month. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=135.51999999999998s)]
*  During their release, Hamas forced their captives to hold their hands, and they demanded they [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=137.84s)]
*  politely wave goodbye as they were whisked away to freedom by the International Red Cross. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  Now think about that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  Hamas killed some of their parents. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=149.68s)]
*  A few weeks later, they are forcing these kids to smile, hold hands, and wave goodbye [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=151.76000000000002s)]
*  to their captives. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=157.20000000000002s)]
*  It is evil. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=158.8s)]
*  It is ugly. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=159.8s)]
*  It is twisted, repulsive. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=160.8s)]
*  But last week, one idiotic British journalist was more concerned that the lives of the Israeli [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=162.48000000000002s)]
*  hostages were being valued way too much. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=167.78s)]
*  Watch this and watch the response. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  I was speaking to a hostage negotiator this morning. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=173.20000000000002s)]
*  He made the comparison between the 50 hostages that Hamas has promised to release, as opposed [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=175.84s)]
*  to the 150 prisoners that are Palestinians that Israel has said that it will release. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=184.20000000000002s)]
*  And he made the comparison between the numbers and the fact that does Israel not think that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Palestinian lives are valued as highly as Israeli lives? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=195.28s)]
*  That is an astonishing accusation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=201.24s)]
*  If we could release one prisoner for every one hostage, we would obviously do that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=204.0s)]
*  We are operating in horrific circumstances. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=208.96s)]
*  We're not choosing to release these prisoners who have blood on their hands. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=211.52s)]
*  We are talking about people who have been convicted of stabbing and shooting attacks. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=215.20000000000002s)]
*  What a disgusting question. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=220.36s)]
*  Not surprising, sadly. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=221.8s)]
*  Of course, this was not a fair trade. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  For example, on one side, you have the release of two, what, innocent three-year-old twins [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=225.46s)]
*  from Israel. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=230.2s)]
*  On the other, you have two Palestinian terrorists. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=231.2s)]
*  Any of that seem fair to you? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=233.72s)]
*  But in all of his infinite wisdom, your president, Joe Biden, knows exactly why Hamas took hostages [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=235.56s)]
*  and murdered close to 1,400 innocent men, women and children on October the 7th. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=241.39999999999998s)]
*  Because according to Joe, Hamas, they were just trying to disrupt Biden's achievements [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=246.76s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=251.04s)]
*  What achievements? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  There is an overwhelming desire on the part of the region to... [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=255.52s)]
*  Let me back up. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=258.32s)]
*  I cannot prove what I'm about to say. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=261.56s)]
*  But I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck when they did was they knew that I [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=264.28000000000003s)]
*  was working very closely with the Saudis and others in the region to bring peace to the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=268.84000000000003s)]
*  region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's right to exist. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=274.84000000000003s)]
*  All right, but here's the truth. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=279.44s)]
*  The evil, ignorant terrorists of Hamas, they hate Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=281.28s)]
*  They've hated Jews. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=285.0s)]
*  They want to wipe Israel off the map. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=286.0s)]
*  Period. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=287.59999999999997s)]
*  End of sentence. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=288.59999999999997s)]
*  They state it. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  It is in their charter. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  That's what they say. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  That's what they have demonstrated. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  And because Joe Biden freed up $50 billion for the mullahs in Iran who back Hamas and [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=293.59999999999997s)]
*  all these other terror groups financially and also militarily, the terrorists had plenty [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=298.84s)]
*  of resources to carry out this massive attack. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=304.11999999999995s)]
*  And the world is less and less peaceful with Biden in charge. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=308.71999999999997s)]
*  As former Defense Secretary Robert Gates famously warned, Biden always seems to make the wrong [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=312.44s)]
*  foreign policy decisions he has throughout his career. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=317.96s)]
*  And now amid rampant anti-Semitism, Biden is reportedly now apologizing to Muslim American [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=321.76s)]
*  leaders for questioning death toll numbers provided by the terror group Hamas. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=327.96s)]
*  That is about as weak and pathetic an excuse for an American president as I've seen in [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=334.28s)]
*  my lifetime and a guy constantly getting bullied at home and abroad and seems to do nothing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=338.0s)]
*  about it. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=343.15999999999997s)]
*  For example, look at the Middle East today. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=344.15999999999997s)]
*  American soldiers, they have been attacked a whopping 73 times since October the 17th [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=346.32s)]
*  with little response from the administration outside of a few targeted strikes, like at [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=352.4s)]
*  empty warehouses in remote locations. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=357.76s)]
*  Meanwhile, just a few days after meeting with Biden in California, now China's dictator, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=360.48s)]
*  President Xi, once again he's ramping up hostilities in the South China Sea, threatening [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=365.4s)]
*  a U.S. warship in international waters and then demanding that the U.S. apologize. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=370.44s)]
*  So what's Biden going to do about that? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=376.04s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=378.32s)]
*  No words, no actions, just dottering along, hoping for the best, and as a result the world [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=379.32s)]
*  is a more dangerous place. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=384.76s)]
*  YouTube page and catch our hottest interviews and most compelling analysis. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIDrotK0UJU&t=390.32s)]
