# Israeli military orders 1.1 million civilians to evacuate Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM)
*  A Fox News alert breaking right now. Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Jordan meeting with the president of the Palestinian Authority. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=0.0s)]
*  Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin is in Tel Aviv to assess U.S. weapons and ammo we have sent to Israel. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  And the war has entered a brand new phase overnight as Israel tells 1.1 million civilians in northern Gaza to move to the south within 24 hours. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=14.4s)]
*  You are watching Fox & Friends First on this Friday morning. I'm Carly Schimkes. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=23.7s)]
*  And I'm Todd Pyro. A ground invasion of the Gaza Strip does appear imminent. Israel warning residents it is planning significant military operations in northern Gaza in the days ahead. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=26.9s)]
*  Hamas terrorists are hiding in Gaza City inside tunnels, underneath houses and inside buildings populated with innocent Gaza civilians. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=38.3s)]
*  Civilians of Gaza City evacuate south for your own safety and the safety of your families and distance yourself from Hamas terrorists who are using you as human shields. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=47.8s)]
*  We have never ever in our history in our history been forced to deal with such a situation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=58.0s)]
*  Trey Yedis is on the ground in southern Israel. Hi Trey. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=65.3s)]
*  Hey guys, good morning. Overnight the Israeli army ordered basically half the population of Gaza to evacuate south. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=69.0s)]
*  This is a significant development and yet another indication that the Israelis do plan to enter the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=78.0s)]
*  We're also learning from the army that overnight 750 targets were hit inside Gaza as the airstrikes against the northern and eastern part of Gaza continue. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=84.0s)]
*  I do want to talk again about that evacuation order. It will be incredibly difficult according to the United Nations to move nearly 1.1 million people south of a line that the Israelis have drawn indicating everyone north of that line could be in danger as an evacuation order was given. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=94.5s)]
*  Hamas also saying today that 13 of the hostages inside Gaza were killed in Israeli strikes in recent days. We have no way to independently verify that number. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=112.0s)]
*  You'll see here today we are at a hospital in the city of Beersheba where we spoke with a police officer who responded to that music festival, one of the many massacres in southern Israel that took place on Saturday kicking off all of these events. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=121.5s)]
*  We went to that festival site and I do want to show you what the scene was like there just yesterday afternoon. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=134.5s)]
*  You can see here in the parking lot of this festival a motorcycle that was used by Hamas militants when they entered from the Gaza Strip into southern Israel. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=140.0s)]
*  The cars here are filled with things you would bring to stay over shoes and bags, hair brushes and makeup. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=151.0s)]
*  This was supposed to be a joyous occasion and it turned into a nightmare for so many. More than 260 people were gunned down here before those militants went on to the next village slaughtering women and children. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=159.5s)]
*  We're going to bring all the warriors of Israel to pass through this festival that was supposed to be love and music. They're going to pass through here. They're going to see the massacre. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=176.0s)]
*  They will know what they're fighting for. We're taking now the cameras from all the cars and we will see with faces everyone that was part of this massacre, we will reach them, he will be dead. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=188.0s)]
*  You can hear the anger in his voice. You can see it in his eyes. That was Daniel Hagari, the spokesman for the IDF who was on the scene there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=206.0s)]
*  While we were at that music festival, Israeli forces actually caught another Palestinian militant in the area. We watched as his hands were tied behind his back and he was blindfolded. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=215.0s)]
*  It shows you just how active the scene is along the Gaza border and how the Israelis plan to take the fight to Hamas. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=225.0s)]
*  They certainly do plan to take the fight to Hamas and that's why they're giving these innocent civilians 24 hours to get out of Gaza City and head south still within the Gaza Strip though. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=232.5s)]
*  Trey, what does this signify to you, this 24 hour window? What is going to happen in 24 hours time? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=244.5s)]
*  Look, all of this indicates it's going to be a very, very difficult battle ahead and when it comes to Gaza, already the death toll is rising each and every hour. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=251.0s)]
*  There are women and children among the dead but the Israelis have made very clear this is them taking their gloves off. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=264.0s)]
*  They plan to launch a complete siege on Gaza and so far they are not allowing any humanitarian aid into Gaza. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=270.5s)]
*  The Egyptians and also the Jordanians have offered to deliver that aid but it just gives you a sense of how dire the humanitarian situation is inside Gaza and it will be something to watch. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=277.5s)]
*  We have seen the images throughout the Gaza Strip, complete destruction of neighborhoods but remember Hamas and Islamic Jihad are fighting in this area and that is part of the reason the Israelis are trying to get those civilians out. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=288.5s)]
*  They are planning to go in and clear the entire northern part of the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=300.0s)]
*  Todd Carley. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=304.0s)]
*  Trey, this is one of the most deeply populated areas not just in Israel but in the entire world when you speak of the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=305.0s)]
*  And if these individuals are going from the north down to the south, it begs the question, where are they physically going to go? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=313.0s)]
*  You know that area well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=321.5s)]
*  Do you have any sense as to physically where that 1.1 million people are ultimately going to be living if they decide to evacuate in the next 24 hours? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=323.5s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=335.5s)]
*  There are three major cities in Gaza. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=336.5s)]
*  Gaza City, Hanunis and Ra'afah and that goes from north to south. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=338.5s)]
*  Now in between there are smaller communities and there are also open fields. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=343.5s)]
*  There are areas where these people could go but there is no safety corridor opened and so basically they will be headed to another area where airstrikes could also take place. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=347.0s)]
*  It will be a humanitarian disaster and it is something that we will continue to report on because there are no clear instructions about where these people will go. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=358.0s)]
*  They likely will walk, not drive and just start going south. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=367.0s)]
*  If the Israelis keep their word on where they are going to target, if they can get past Wadi Gaza, a place in the middle of the Gaza Strip, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=371.5s)]
*  they will be able to enter some of these communities and simply have to wait there until orders are given according to the statement by the IDF that they can return. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=378.5s)]
*  And Trey, couldn't members of Hamas slip in with the civilian population and also try and leave Gaza City as well? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=388.5s)]
*  The civilian population in Gaza? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=395.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was wondering about members of Hamas also just putting on civilian clothing and leaving this area that Israel has already warned that it is going to target. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=401.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, there is absolutely going to be surprise attacks. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=413.0s)]
*  This will be urban guerrilla style battles that the Israelis are facing. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=418.0s)]
*  They will see explosives, roadside bombs, snipers on rooftops and Hamas will not be kitted out in many cases looking like fighters. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=423.5s)]
*  They will look just like a person walking down the street and it is part of the danger the Israelis face when they operate inside Gaza City. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=433.5s)]
*  Look, it is going to be a very, very difficult battle, a ground battle. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=439.5s)]
*  They have seen this before and there will be casualties in the Israeli forces. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=445.5s)]
*  And if we don't make no mistake about that, this will be a very, very challenging operation. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=450.0s)]
*  When we talk about the number of Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters along with PFLP and other smaller Palestinian organizations, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=456.0s)]
*  we are talking about thousands and thousands of fighters and they are armed with things like RPGs and machine guns and even anti-tank weapons. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=462.0s)]
*  They get hit hard when they go in and remember they are operating in an environment that the Palestinian fighters understand, like the back of their hands. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=472.5s)]
*  They have lived there, they have grown up in Gaza, so they know where to hide, they know where the tunnels are, they know how to surprise any sort of forces that enter. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=479.5s)]
*  And these all add to the challenges that the Israelis will face when they do enter Gaza. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=486.5s)]
*  A tremendously challenging situation and I think, Karli, you raise a great point. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=490.5s)]
*  I think the way these terrorists could just slip in, what could they do to their own Palestinian population and also to the forces that are potentially moving them out. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=496.0s)]
*  It is a dire situation. We will keep our eye on it. Trey Yanks, thank you. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=503.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=506.0s)]
*  With that, let us bring in Brian Stern, the CEO and founder of Project Dynamo. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=507.0s)]
*  As we've reported on the show, we've interviewed you. You are assisting in the evacuation of many American citizens. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=512.0s)]
*  And to that point, Brian, you'd think the United States government would also be taking part in that as well. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=519.0s)]
*  We have our own Jackie Heinrich asking White House spokesperson John Kirby about charter flights for Americans. Take a listen. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=525.5s)]
*  We are directing American citizens to basically find their way, their own way, to U.S. help on the other side. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=532.5s)]
*  Whereas you've got other countries that are sending their military in or doing evacuations in a more formal way. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=540.5s)]
*  Sometimes it is really hard to get a sense of what the population is. In places like Israel, there are a lot of Americans. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=548.0s)]
*  Most of them, well, maybe most are dual nationals, but a lot of Americans are there. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=557.0s)]
*  Other nations have smaller populations. And maybe they have to make their own decisions about how they are going to handle those smaller populations. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=563.0s)]
*  Brian, you're doing the work of evacuations. Your reaction to that statement from John Kirby in what appears to me to be history repeating itself. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=570.5s)]
*  Afghanistan, Ukraine, and now Israel. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=579.5s)]
*  And don't forget in there, don't forget in there, Sudan. Everyone forgets about Sudan. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=583.5s)]
*  This is Project Dynamo's fourth war zone deployment in 24 months. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=587.5s)]
*  We started in Afghanistan, we went to Ukraine, then we went to Sudan. Somewhere in there we did Russia. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=592.5s)]
*  Now here we are in Israel and then also Maui and Hurricane Ian. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=599.0s)]
*  So in 24 short months, we've seen this pattern of Americans being left or being trapped or what have you without a lot of support from the government. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=603.0s)]
*  Why that is and how that is is above our pay grade, but we're donor funded. We live off donations. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=618.0s)]
*  Project Dynamo dot org is where people can go to donate. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=625.5s)]
*  But I can't speak intelligently as to why this happens seemingly every 180 days, but here we are. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=627.5s)]
*  Well, starting today the Biden administration says that they're going to be sending charter flights to get people out of Israel into Europe. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=638.5s)]
*  Once they're in Europe, then they're going to have to find their own way home. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=645.5s)]
*  How do you feel about that plan and do you think that it should have happened a little bit sooner? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=647.5s)]
*  I think the situation is very simple. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=653.0s)]
*  This is a country at war as declared by its government to the extent that we felt compelled to put a carrier strike group off the coast with a bunch of special operations guys on the ground with the recognition of American hostages and Americans being killed. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=658.0s)]
*  It doesn't sound like a nice place to come and go as you please, which is probably why the other countries sent so many charter planes to bring their people out because it's dangerous. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=674.5s)]
*  It's going to get more dangerous. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=685.5s)]
*  So, you know, as it relates to the speed, anytime Americans are at risk of being killed, we need to react extremely quickly. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=686.5s)]
*  It should be unconfusing. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=697.5s)]
*  It should be unambiguous. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=698.5s)]
*  I think we're doing a good job. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=701.0s)]
*  I think we're doing a good job of that with all the military stuff and military aid and support and all that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=702.0s)]
*  I think they're doing a very good job. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=708.0s)]
*  However, if you're an American civilian and you're stuck here in the middle of the pending ground offensive, all that military aid doesn't really help you a whole lot. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=710.0s)]
*  It just doesn't. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=719.0s)]
*  So that's why we're here. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=720.0s)]
*  Brian, every time you are on our air, you put out a call for fundraising and rightly so. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=721.0s)]
*  I'm not absolutely not calling you out on that. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=726.0s)]
*  You need to do that because you're doing the Lord's work and you need that money every two weeks. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=728.5s)]
*  I make a donation to the federal government to do this. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=732.5s)]
*  Let's be realistic. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=734.5s)]
*  They don't need my money. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=735.5s)]
*  They're doing pretty well on their own. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=737.5s)]
*  They have a lot of money. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=738.5s)]
*  So what do you make of this report that Joe Biden's administration is allegedly going to make people who are evacuated pay for their charter flights? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=739.5s)]
*  I think it's insane is what I think. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=750.5s)]
*  I think it's incredibly unethical. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=753.5s)]
*  Project Dynamo makes it a policy of we don't charge people money. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=756.0s)]
*  We don't ask for money. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=759.0s)]
*  If people give, they give. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=760.0s)]
*  If they don't, they still go. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=762.0s)]
*  So I think it's kind of, you know, again, these are policy things. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=764.0s)]
*  I can't, you know, I'm not a politician. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=769.0s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=771.0s)]
*  I like to save lives. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=772.0s)]
*  That's what I do. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=773.0s)]
*  That's what I do all day and all night long. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=774.0s)]
*  I would, I can't fathom that concept, frankly. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=775.0s)]
*  I'm hoping that there's some weird policy requirement that makes them do that. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=781.0s)]
*  It's the only thing I could ever think of. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=785.0s)]
*  But yeah, I just think it's nuts. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=786.5s)]
*  And you have people who have lost everything who are fleeing and to say, well, only if you pay us back. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=788.5s)]
*  I kind of reject that. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=794.5s)]
*  It's kind of like the dual citizen thing. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=797.5s)]
*  Everyone's, you know, Admiral Kirby was just saying, well, there's a lot of dual citizens. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=799.5s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=803.5s)]
*  If you have an American passport, you're an American. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=804.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=806.5s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=807.5s)]
*  If you have a passport that looks like mine, you're American. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=808.5s)]
*  You're one of us, absolutely. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=814.0s)]
*  Well, yesterday, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, I know he announced that he is going to be partnering with your organization, Project Dynamo, to get people home, to get Floridians home. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=815.0s)]
*  So that's very good news there. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=823.0s)]
*  And to the earlier point, do please go to projectdynamo.org to donate. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmZs63kxBMM&t=825.0s)]
