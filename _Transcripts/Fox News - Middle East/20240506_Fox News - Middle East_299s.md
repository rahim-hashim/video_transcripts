# The White House is mixing US politics with foreign policy: Kayleigh McEnany
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc)
*  Well, let's bring in former White House press secretary and co-host about a number, Kayleigh [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=0.0s)]
*  McEnany. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=3.2s)]
*  Kayleigh, I guess the White House is probably prudently staying quiet about this, not wanting [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=4.2s)]
*  to derail it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=9.52s)]
*  But there's a real question as to whether or not this is a viable deal at all, or whether [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=10.88s)]
*  Hamas is just trying to play a PR game and make it look like it's the Israelis who are [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=14.72s)]
*  the intransigent party. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=19.16s)]
*  And that's what Israel claims, and that's very likely the case. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=22.84s)]
*  Very fair of the White House to say, I'm not going to get ahead of this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=26.84s)]
*  There are ongoing negotiations. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=30.44s)]
*  You heard him say Director Burns at this moment is talking this out and hashing out the details. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=31.96s)]
*  That is all fair. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=36.620000000000005s)]
*  But the policy coming out of the administration of, we don't want to see Israel go into Ra'afah. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=38.26s)]
*  We think the way forward is a deal where hostages are released, and there's not this procession [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=44.84s)]
*  into Ra'afah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=50.56s)]
*  That's essentially saying to America's greatest ally in the Middle East, just sit back and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=52.08s)]
*  wait for the next October 7th, because that is what Hamas would do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=56.739999999999995s)]
*  We know how Hamas works. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=60.48s)]
*  So the policy coming out of that briefing is a very, very erroneous one. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=61.739999999999995s)]
*  However, being safe on the details of the diplomatic discussions, that is entirely fair. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=67.32s)]
*  So Kayleigh, last week, I want to make sure I get the order of this right, just based [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=73.84s)]
*  on my recent memory. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=78.38s)]
*  Hamas, well, we learned that another hostage died while in Hamas captivity. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=79.96s)]
*  We don't know exactly when. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=86.83999999999999s)]
*  Then Hamas turned down a ceasefire agreement on the table. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=89.08s)]
*  Then over the weekend, Hamas killed four IDF soldiers inside a humanitarian zone, and then [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=94.36s)]
*  miraculously, with maybe an early Christmas in July gift, they announced to the world [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=99.84s)]
*  that they have agreed to the terms of a ceasefire. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=105.84s)]
*  I mean, how could you turn that down? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=109.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=110.64s)]
*  Right, right, exactly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=112.64s)]
*  The timeline speaks for itself. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=114.28s)]
*  And as Israel is saying, evacuate Ra'afah, because we are on the precipice of an invasion. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=116.24000000000001s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, they miraculously agree to this ceasefire, of which we don't [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=122.4s)]
*  even know what the terms were or are, or if there was any Israeli discussion there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=126.12s)]
*  But one other thing I just want to point out is we were listening to that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=131.74s)]
*  And John, I'm sure you would agree with me here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=134.88s)]
*  I mean, where were the questions about the aid that was halted, this huge Axios report [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=137.36s)]
*  we've been talking about for more than 24 hours? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=143.44s)]
*  And the line at the bottom is the White House has declined to comment as to why this ammunition [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=146.12s)]
*  was halted. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=150.04s)]
*  You know, hopefully the reporters get there. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=151.04s)]
*  But that's a huge outstanding question after the ceasefire. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=153.04s)]
*  If you're not getting anywhere there, move to the next topic, because that's a big one. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=156.28s)]
*  Yeah, well, there's no wonder that Hamas is feeling emboldened, because you had that report [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=160.0s)]
*  of the weekend that Biden was withholding a shipment of weapons to Israel. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=164.04s)]
*  You've got Bernie Sanders saying, oh, no, they can't go into Rafa. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  You've got to do everything that you possibly can to stop this. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=171.23999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is looking at this and saying, wow, we're getting a lot of support from the United [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  States. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=176.92s)]
*  Why wouldn't we push Israel to adopt a ceasefire that's in our best interest, but not theirs? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=177.92s)]
*  But here's the question that's always daunted me. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  This White House seems to be pushing for a ceasefire deal in exchange for the hostages. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  And to your point, then what? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  Because if Hamas is left with its four brigades in Rafa, October 7th will happen again at [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=192.8s)]
*  some point in the future. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=198.28s)]
*  And we're at a point now, we brought this up with Brent Sadler, where Iran has been [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=200.28s)]
*  made to look like a toothless tiger that it can throw literally everything it's got at [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=203.92000000000002s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=207.66000000000003s)]
*  99% of it gets shot down. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=208.66000000000003s)]
*  So Israel and the U.S., it would seem to me, are in a better position than ever to demand [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=210.9s)]
*  an unconditional surrender by Hamas and then get to some sort of political solution for [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=217.44s)]
*  the way forward. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=223.12s)]
*  Yeah, but you need resolve in the White House. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=224.12s)]
*  You need a very clear foreign policy doctrine, absolute resolve behind our ally Israel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=228.2s)]
*  But to your point, what they're asking is release the hostages, which Israel says there [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=233.36s)]
*  are about 130. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=237.56s)]
*  They presume, Israel, that perhaps a quarter of them are not even alive anymore, which [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=239.06s)]
*  is tragic to think about. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=243.3s)]
*  But then you leave Hamas leadership in place in the tunnels of Rafa. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=245.64s)]
*  You leave the infrastructure in place so that all of a sudden, Iran, the proxies, can flood [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=249.32s)]
*  weapons back to Hamas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  So October 7th happens again. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=255.16s)]
*  I fear what is happening here is domestic politics is entering what should be a sacrosanct [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=257.2s)]
*  realm of foreign policy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=263.0s)]
*  They have to appease this left flank of the Democratic Party. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=264.76s)]
*  It's why we're hearing about Palestinian refugees. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=268.34s)]
*  It's why there's this tepid equivocation on our support for Israel. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=271.21999999999997s)]
*  And unfortunately, I'm only left to conclude that domestic politics is at play where it [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=275.44s)]
*  should not be. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=281.44s)]
*  Kayleigh, thanks for hanging out with us. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=282.44s)]

*  We'll see you tomorrow on Outnumbered. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iEAxQ0YcYIc&t=285.0s)]
