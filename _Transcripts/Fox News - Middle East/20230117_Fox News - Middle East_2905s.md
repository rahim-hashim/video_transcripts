# Karine Jean-Pierre dodges question on Biden making zero trade deals
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE)
*  Wow, such a quiet day, nothing going on here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=0.0s)]
*  Come on, come on guys, please right here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=7.44s)]
*  Please flank me, I love it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  Good afternoon everybody. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  Come on, there's a lot of people here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=17.54s)]
*  Good afternoon everybody. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=19.04s)]
*  Okay, so as you can all see, we have a couple of special guests [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=21.34s)]
*  here today in the briefing room. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=25.44s)]
*  I am proud, so proud to welcome to the podium Coach Steve Kerr, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  hello, head coach of the Golden State Warriors, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=31.84s)]
*  and nine-time NBA champion as both a coach and a player, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  and Steph Curry, four-time NBA champion and two-time NBA [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=40.12s)]
*  most valuable player. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=45.72s)]
*  Coach Kerr and Steph will say a few words about their visit to DC today, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=47.8s)]
*  and an issue that's close to their hearts. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=52.64s)]
*  And so I'm going to let them take over. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=55.2s)]
*  But you know, I almost coach, I almost went pro. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=56.78s)]
*  But you know, being five foot two, five foot three, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=60.22s)]
*  didn't make it happen. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=63.5s)]
*  But there's this great video of me and Sue Bird, an amazing icon [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=64.42s)]
*  in the NBA, you should check that out. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=68.38s)]
*  But anyway, I'm going to let you guys take over. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=70.86s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=73.66s)]
*  Thank you so much for having us today. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=75.34s)]
*  On behalf of the Warriors, I want to thank President Biden [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=78.1s)]
*  and Vice President Harris for the invitation [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=81.5s)]
*  to come to the White House today to celebrate our championship [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=83.74s)]
*  from a year ago. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=87.66s)]
*  It's a great reminder of how lucky we are to be Americans, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=89.89999999999999s)]
*  to live in a country where we can chase our dreams [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=93.14s)]
*  and enjoy the fruits of our labor and the celebration of all those around us. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=96.74s)]
*  And to come here today with members of the organization to celebrate [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=103.78s)]
*  is really something special. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=108.46s)]
*  It was also very fulfilling for me just a little while [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=110.62s)]
*  ago to take part in a roundtable on gun violence and gun safety [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=115.34s)]
*  with some senior White House staffers, along with Clay Thompson and Moses [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=122.38000000000001s)]
*  Moody over the last hour or so. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  We learned a lot about what this administration is [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=129.66s)]
*  doing to help create a safer environment in our country, something [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=133.14000000000001s)]
*  that's very close to my heart. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=138.7s)]
*  And it's wonderful for me to learn a lot more than I knew. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=140.85999999999999s)]
*  So coming in today, it's a great day on many fronts. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=145.98s)]
*  So thanks for the invitation. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=150.38s)]
*  And I'm going to turn it over to Mr. Curry. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=152.22s)]
*  Thanks, Coach. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=155.66s)]
*  I echo what he said. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=157.85999999999999s)]
*  I want to thank President Biden and Vice President Harris [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=158.78s)]
*  for the invitation to come here. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  It's something that we don't ever take for granted. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  Seven years ago, I believe, we were here last celebrating [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=166.62s)]
*  our first championship and now back to celebrate our fourth. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=169.66000000000003s)]
*  So to have this opportunity to reflect on the accomplishment last year, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=172.12s)]
*  to bring everybody together to celebrate that, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=177.62s)]
*  to also acknowledge the place sports has and bringing people together [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=180.82000000000002s)]
*  from all walks of life, all backgrounds, to provide inspiration, hope, love, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=185.14000000000001s)]
*  togetherness. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=191.26000000000002s)]
*  And that's what our journey was last year. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  So to have another opportunity to celebrate that means a lot. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=194.94s)]
*  And a great opportunity for us from the basketball community [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=197.34s)]
*  to thank President Biden and his staff for all their hard work and diligence [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=201.06s)]
*  on getting Brittany Griner home, who is a big part of our basketball family. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=206.62s)]
*  And it means a lot to know that she's here and home safe with her family [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=212.78s)]
*  and all the work that went on behind the scenes to make that a reality. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=216.18s)]
*  So I just want to say thank you there. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=219.1s)]
*  And I'm very excited to be here and celebrate the day, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=221.74s)]
*  celebrate with our families, and appreciate the invitation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=224.14s)]
*  This is truly, truly special. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=227.33999999999997s)]
*  So thank you to everybody. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=229.1s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=231.01999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=231.73999999999998s)]
*  Thank you, guys. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=232.89999999999998s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=234.57999999999998s)]
*  No questions for Ray? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=236.14s)]
*  It's all time? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=237.85999999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=238.77999999999997s)]
*  They have, as you can imagine, they have a tight schedule. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=240.82s)]
*  I think they're on their way to meet with the president right now. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=243.82s)]
*  And then as you know, some of you will get to see the two of them [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=246.5s)]
*  and the rest of the team at the event that we're [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=250.29999999999998s)]
*  having for the Warriors in about an hour or less than an hour. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=253.06s)]
*  OK, folks, thank you so much for joining us today. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=257.18s)]
*  And it was great to hear from two people who have really [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=260.98s)]
*  been passionate voices on the issue that you heard them talk about, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=265.58s)]
*  which was gun violence prevention. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=269.58s)]
*  And we really, really are thankful to them for using their platform, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=272.14s)]
*  their very, very big platform, to talk about an issue that is truly, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=276.62s)]
*  as you all know and report, that is destroying many families [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=281.02s)]
*  across the country, many communities. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=284.58s)]
*  And as you know, that the president has worked and been a leader on [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  for many decades. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=289.85999999999996s)]
*  And the bipartisan gun prevention bill that was signed this summer [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=290.97999999999996s)]
*  just showed the president's commitment to this issue. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=297.85999999999996s)]
*  And as you all know, it continues. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=301.46s)]
*  It doesn't stop with that legislation. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=303.41999999999996s)]
*  On Friday, it was reported that Republicans have so-called plan [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=306.02s)]
*  to prioritize payments if Congress fails to address the debt ceiling. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=310.86s)]
*  So I want to be very, very clear here, as I have been, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=315.42s)]
*  as the president has been, this is not a plan. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=318.1s)]
*  It is a recipe for economic catastrophe. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  As President Biden has made clear, Congress must deal with the debt limit [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=324.82s)]
*  and must do so without conditions. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=329.3s)]
*  But congressional Republicans are threatening to hold the nation's [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  full faith and credit, a mandate of the Constitution [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=337.62s)]
*  hostage to their demands to cut Social Security, to cut Medicare, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=341.58s)]
*  and to cut Medicaid, brinksmanship that threatens the global economy. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=346.54s)]
*  Their latest idea is that rather than paying its bills, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=352.64s)]
*  the United States should make payment to wealthy bondholders, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=355.9s)]
*  including foreign investors, and stop payments for border security, food [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=359.3s)]
*  nursing homes, school lunches, the FAA, drug enforcement, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=364.82s)]
*  and other programs Americans rely on every single day. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  This so-called prioritization scheme makes Republicans' priorities pretty [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=373.82s)]
*  clear, crystal clear, if I may add. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=378.34s)]
*  They want to put wealthy bondholders over ordinary Americans who [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=380.5s)]
*  want safe food, safe skies, safe communities, and secure borders. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=384.26s)]
*  And it does not, it does nothing, absolutely nothing [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=389.3s)]
*  to change the fact that failing to deal with the debt limit [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=392.76s)]
*  would cause economic catastrophe. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=396.64s)]
*  Bipartisan former treasurer secretaries and independent experts [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=400.03999999999996s)]
*  have called out how dangerous failing to raise the debt ceiling would be. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=403.59999999999997s)]
*  And for example, I'll give you a couple. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=408.76s)]
*  The Chamber of Commerce said it would have catastrophic economic consequences, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=411.12s)]
*  end quote. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  In 2011, then-Treasuries Secretary Tim Geithner [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=416.2s)]
*  called it unworkable and also harmful. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=419.48s)]
*  And a former economist to Republican senators Rob Portman, Marco Rubio, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=424.44s)]
*  and Mitt Romney called it really bad idea and, I quote, disaster. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  This is just another attempt by congressional Republicans [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=436.56s)]
*  to force unpopular cuts on programs critical to seniors, the middle class, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=439.22s)]
*  and working families. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=443.8s)]
*  Congress needs to act and do so swiftly. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=445.54s)]
*  There is no excuse for political brinksmanship [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=449.12s)]
*  when American jobs and economic safety is on the line here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=451.8s)]
*  I also wanted to highlight that this morning the White House released [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=457.72s)]
*  the first ever national strategy to advance equity, justice, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=460.72s)]
*  and opportunity for Asian-Americans, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=464.08s)]
*  communities. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=469.08s)]
*  The strategy details much needed investment from 32 federal agencies, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=470.4s)]
*  including improved data, language access, and combating anti-Asian hate. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=474.28s)]
*  This unprecedented plan builds on the administration's broader equity agenda [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=479.55999999999995s)]
*  and President Biden's historic executive order [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=483.84s)]
*  to establish and reinvigorate the White House initiative on AA and NHPIs. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  And we're proud that the Biden-Harris administration reflects [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=492.35999999999996s)]
*  the rich diversity of America, including the first Asian-American [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=494.78s)]
*  vice president. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=498.46s)]
*  14% of our appointees and nominees identify as AA and NHPI, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=499.44s)]
*  double the share of the population. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=505.96s)]
*  You can read the full strategy and more about the initiative [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=508.4s)]
*  on the whitehouse.gov. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=511.04s)]
*  And finally, this morning, as some of you have already either covered [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=513.04s)]
*  or wrote about, Census Bureau released data [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=517.28s)]
*  that showed that President Biden's first two years in office [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=520.24s)]
*  have been the two greatest years for new small business applications [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=523.18s)]
*  on record, with 10.5 million total new business created, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=527.76s)]
*  with unemployment at a record low and the two strongest years of job [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=532.92s)]
*  creation in our history. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=536.76s)]
*  There are reasons for economic optimism all over the country. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=539.24s)]
*  Today's new data is the latest confirmation [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=543.2s)]
*  that President Biden's economic plan is indeed working [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=545.36s)]
*  and is building our economy from the bottom up and the middle out. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=549.1s)]
*  Zeke, you want to take it? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=553.56s)]
*  Thanks, Grainne. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=554.76s)]
*  Two questions for you. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=556.12s)]
*  I think to start off with, over the weekend, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=557.08s)]
*  the British government confirmed it was sending tanks [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=559.24s)]
*  to Ukraine for the first time. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=562.6s)]
*  Will the US follow suit, meet Ukraine's request there, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=564.68s)]
*  and then separately, Prime Minister Rydzad [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=567.76s)]
*  in the meeting with the NATO whole office, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=569.68s)]
*  who knows very well he alluded to potentially joining the US [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=571.24s)]
*  in Germany and sending a patriotism system to Ukraine. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=574.36s)]
*  Can you confirm that that was the announcement that's [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=577.4s)]
*  coming out of the meeting? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=579.56s)]
*  We haven't gotten a readout yet. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=580.16s)]
*  OK, so we're going to have a readout very, very shortly. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=581.48s)]
*  So once we have that, I will share that with all. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=584.12s)]
*  We will share. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=586.56s)]
*  The team will share that with all of you. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=587.36s)]
*  As far as patriot missiles, I can say they discussed that, the war [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=589.84s)]
*  in Ukraine and the importance of all the ongoing security assistance. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=595.4s)]
*  But I would refer to Dutch for any specifics about their own plans [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=600.56s)]
*  as it relates to that specifically. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=604.32s)]
*  As it relates to the conversation on, I'm sorry, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=607.24s)]
*  I forgot the first question. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=611.32s)]
*  Penny, do you agree that the British are going to not [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=612.6s)]
*  have a political comment? [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=614.8000000000001s)]
*  So look, we are always very, very careful on what our, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=615.84s)]
*  you know, we don't like to tell our allies what they should or should [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=622.72s)]
*  not do. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=628.12s)]
*  But as you know, we have been partners with them [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=629.32s)]
*  when it comes to Ukraine, partners with our allies, [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=632.2s)]
*  and partners with them on how we are continuing [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=635.64s)]
*  to provide assistance to Ukraine in this aggressive war that we have [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=638.92s)]
*  seen, this brutal war that we continue to see by Russia. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=644.04s)]
*  But certainly, that is not something that we will direct. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=647.04s)]
*  We will continue to focus. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=651.2s)]
*  We have been the country that has provided the most assistance, [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=652.48s)]
*  as you all know, when it comes to security assistance, [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=655.68s)]
*  when it comes to humanitarian aid. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=659.08s)]
*  And we are in constant conversations with Ukraine [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=661.0s)]
*  on what their needs are. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=664.2s)]
*  And so we're going to continue to do that [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=666.08s)]
*  alongside our partners and also our allies. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=668.12s)]
*  But this is now an area where the UK is going to be ahead of the US [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=670.52s)]
*  sending Western tanks to Ukraine. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=674.2s)]
*  They're going ahead of sending more than a dozen of them [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=677.08s)]
*  in the coming weeks and months. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=680.16s)]
*  The White House still hasn't approved that. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=681.64s)]
*  So is that in the offing now for the US to leapfrog ahead back [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=683.52s)]
*  into the lead in providing assistance for Ukraine? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=687.76s)]
*  Again, look, we are in constant conversation [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=690.16s)]
*  with the Ukrainians on their assistance. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=692.92s)]
*  We have given the most assistance in any other country. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=697.0s)]
*  The president, when he walked into the administration, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=700.32s)]
*  he made sure that he brought the NATO together, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=702.64s)]
*  he brought our alliance and partners together [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=705.6800000000001s)]
*  to make sure that we had the backs of the Ukrainian people. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=708.24s)]
*  And so that is something that we're going to continue to do. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=712.36s)]
*  Certainly, I'm not going to get ahead of any announcements [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=715.24s)]
*  from here. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=718.32s)]
*  But again, we will be with the Ukrainian people [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  for as long as it takes for them to defend themselves, [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=723.4000000000001s)]
*  to defend themselves against the brutal brutality [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=726.5200000000001s)]
*  that we are seeing from the Russian aggression. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=730.08s)]
*  I just want to add a different topic. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=732.6s)]
*  I'm running the discovery of classified [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=734.44s)]
*  and official documents of the president's residence [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=736.24s)]
*  in the former office. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=738.12s)]
*  Last week, you told that thing that it was still [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=739.6400000000001s)]
*  that we all can assume, the American people could assume [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=742.6400000000001s)]
*  that the searches were complete [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=744.84s)]
*  and all the documents had been recovered. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=746.1600000000001s)]
*  On Saturday, the White House Counsel's office [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=748.4000000000001s)]
*  said that five additional classified documents [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=751.6s)]
*  had been found. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=753.6s)]
*  Is it safe to assume now that all the documents [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=755.12s)]
*  have been recovered, all the official records, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=757.48s)]
*  all the classified documents are back in the cuts [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=760.08s)]
*  of the National Archives? [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=762.0s)]
*  Or are more searches underway to find out [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=763.16s)]
*  if there's anything else there? [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=765.28s)]
*  Look, I understand your question. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=766.28s)]
*  We have addressed multiple questions from here. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=767.88s)]
*  Multiple questions have been answered by the president. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=770.48s)]
*  I know that you all just spent about some of you, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=773.24s)]
*  some of your colleagues, maybe you yourself, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=775.76s)]
*  Zeke was on the phone with my colleague [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=777.36s)]
*  for about 45 minutes that addressed [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=779.32s)]
*  a lot of your questions. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=781.32s)]
*  I'm just going to continue to be prudent here. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=782.96s)]
*  I'm going to let this ongoing review that is happening, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=785.5600000000001s)]
*  this legal process that is happening, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  and let that process continue under the special counsel. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=792.08s)]
*  I'm not going to comment from here. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=796.64s)]
*  One of the things that we have said for the last two years, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=799.72s)]
*  when it comes to the Department of Justice, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=803.2s)]
*  when it comes to legal matters, when it comes to legal issues, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=805.0400000000001s)]
*  we have been very clear that we are not going to comment. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=808.1600000000001s)]
*  We are not going to politically interfere. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=811.08s)]
*  And that continues with this also, this legal issue. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=814.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I would refer you to the Department of Justice, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=817.48s)]
*  refer you to the special counsel as it relates to specifics on this issue. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=820.08s)]
*  And also my White House counsel colleagues are engaging with all of you [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=823.84s)]
*  and will certainly continue to have conversations on this. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=828.0s)]
*  I will say that we are consistent with what we have said [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=831.5600000000001s)]
*  on cooperating fully with the Department of Justice on this issue. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=835.6s)]
*  And we will continue to cooperate fully with the special counsel. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=840.24s)]
*  Thanks, Grace. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=844.04s)]
*  On Friday, you stood here, though, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=845.08s)]
*  and were asked about these documents issued by our counsel 18 times. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=846.28s)]
*  At that point, the president's lawyers had found these five additional pages [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=849.92s)]
*  of classified documents. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=853.72s)]
*  So did you not know on Friday that those documents had been found [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=854.92s)]
*  when you were at the podium, or are you being directed by someone [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=858.08s)]
*  to not be forthcoming on this issue? [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=861.36s)]
*  I have been forthcoming from this podium. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=863.36s)]
*  What I said yes to was what the statement at the time that we all had. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=865.52s)]
*  You all had the statement, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=870.3199999999999s)]
*  and I was repeating what the counsel was sharing at that time. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=872.1999999999999s)]
*  We had that statement, so we knew what was in it, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=876.9599999999999s)]
*  but you also knew. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=879.28s)]
*  Did you not know that the... [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=880.7199999999999s)]
*  I'm telling you, I just answered the question. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=881.7199999999999s)]
*  I just said that I was repeating what the information that we had at that time, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=883.7199999999999s)]
*  that you all had. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=888.7199999999999s)]
*  I was confirming from what the special counsel had provided to all of you [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=889.7199999999999s)]
*  and that we knew as well from here. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=894.16s)]
*  So just to be very, very clear. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=896.52s)]
*  And look, I've also been very clear about being prudent from here. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=898.8399999999999s)]
*  I was also being very clear about being consistent from here [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  and not going beyond what is currently happening, right? [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=906.8s)]
*  And again, this is an ongoing... [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=911.3199999999999s)]
*  I also said this was an ongoing review that was happening [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=913.3199999999999s)]
*  with the Department of Justice and as we know with the special counsel, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=917.0s)]
*  I've been very consistent about that as well. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=920.0s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons... [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=922.5999999999999s)]
*  Your question to me is one of the reasons why we are being very, [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=924.0799999999999s)]
*  very careful and very mindful and to not interfere here [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=928.44s)]
*  and to make sure, to make sure that the Department of Justice [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=933.12s)]
*  has their independence. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=936.6s)]
*  Your question actually proves that. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=937.84s)]
*  And that's why we're going to continue to refer you to the Department of Justice [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=939.7600000000001s)]
*  and refer you to the special counsel or my colleagues at White House counsel. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=943.84s)]
*  Does President Biden have confidence in the way his team is handling this [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=947.7600000000001s)]
*  with this trickle out of information and the documents being found day after day? [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=950.8800000000001s)]
*  I can tell you this, the president has confidence. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=954.96s)]
*  I can tell you this, that the president and his team rightfully took action [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=957.36s)]
*  when they learned that the documents existed. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  They reached out to the archives. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=965.32s)]
*  They reached out to the Department of Justice. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=967.16s)]
*  That is the steps. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=969.32s)]
*  We have been very clear about that, the steps and the process that we took here. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=970.2s)]
*  And look, we're going to continue. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=975.84s)]
*  We're going to continue to, as we have said, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=978.2s)]
*  fully cooperate with the Department of Justice. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=981.44s)]
*  We're going to fully cooperate with the president's team is, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=983.48s)]
*  going to fully cooperate with the special counsel. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=986.92s)]
*  That does not stop. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=989.04s)]
*  And that will just continue. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=990.04s)]
*  Again, we are going to respect the independence of the Department of Justice. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=991.4s)]
*  Could you describe his mood to us and the conversations you've had with him [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=994.9599999999999s)]
*  on this issue? [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=997.4799999999999s)]
*  His mood has been very clear. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=998.28s)]
*  I saw him this morning. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=999.64s)]
*  He's very focused. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1000.92s)]
*  I traveled with him this weekend. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1002.0799999999999s)]
*  He wants to make sure that he's continuing, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1004.76s)]
*  and we are continuing to deliver for the American people. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1006.8s)]
*  And we've been pretty consistent on that. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1009.52s)]
*  If you think about last week, you heard from him [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1013.28s)]
*  about how his economic plan is working, how we have seen inflation go down [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1015.1999999999999s)]
*  for six months straight, how we have seen unemployment numbers [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1020.36s)]
*  at its lowest level in 50 years, that matters. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1025.28s)]
*  That is also the things that this country, the people in this country, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1028.68s)]
*  are also very, very concerned about and want to hear what this president is [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  doing every day. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1037.04s)]
*  That's his focus, and that's what he's going to continue to talk about. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  Go ahead, Steve. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1040.68s)]
*  What's the White House reaction to the news in Dnipro [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1041.28s)]
*  with the Russians bombing an apartment building [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1043.8s)]
*  and killed dozens of civilians? [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1045.8s)]
*  So look, this weekend's strikes are another example, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1047.96s)]
*  as you've heard us say, of the brutal and barbaric war [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1050.76s)]
*  that Russia is waging against the Ukrainian people. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1055.04s)]
*  And we have seen this over and over again for about 10 months now, 11 [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1058.04s)]
*  months now. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1062.52s)]
*  The United States will continue to provide, as I said at the top, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1063.44s)]
*  Ukraine with what it needs to defend itself. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1066.48s)]
*  That is incredibly important. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1069.12s)]
*  That is a promise that the president made to President Zelensky [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1070.44s)]
*  when he was here not too long ago. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1073.48s)]
*  And that's including air defense system, along with our allies and partners, [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1075.76s)]
*  as I just said. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1080.04s)]
*  We will continue our work to hold Russian forces accountable [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1081.0s)]
*  for the atrocities that they've caused and also the war crimes. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1086.64s)]
*  But one of the things that we continue to see Russia do [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1090.4s)]
*  is that they underestimate the strength and the courage [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1093.04s)]
*  and the resolve of the Ukrainian people. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1096.56s)]
*  And they will be proven wrong again in their latest attempts. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1098.64s)]
*  The debt ceiling is supposed to reach its ceiling on Thursday. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1102.68s)]
*  How do you see the debt ceiling fight playing out? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1106.16s)]
*  What's your strategy for getting out of Greece? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1108.8799999999999s)]
*  So look, we have been very clear on this. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1110.92s)]
*  And I said it at the top. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1113.08s)]
*  I said it on Friday, and I'll say it today. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1114.24s)]
*  So has the president. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1116.12s)]
*  This should not be political brinksmanship. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1117.68s)]
*  We should be dealing with the debt ceiling without conditions. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1120.2s)]
*  It is important. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1125.16s)]
*  We're not going to work our way around this. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1125.96s)]
*  We're not going to negotiate on this. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1127.84s)]
*  This is the basic duties of Congress, [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1129.8s)]
*  is to deal with this issue. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1133.6399999999999s)]
*  And let's not forget, in the last administration, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1134.76s)]
*  they, meaning Democrats and Republicans, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1137.48s)]
*  were able to deal with the debt limit three times. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1140.3999999999999s)]
*  Three times. [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1144.24s)]
*  So this is something that needs to be done, [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1145.28s)]
*  that should be done. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1147.52s)]
*  And we call on Congress to act. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1148.9199999999998s)]
*  Lastly, is the president going to sit down with Republicans [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1151.08s)]
*  and talk about this? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1153.76s)]
*  Again, this is something that should [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1154.84s)]
*  be done without conditions. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1157.76s)]
*  We have been very, very clear about that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1159.56s)]
*  We are not going to be negotiating [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1162.8s)]
*  over the debt ceiling. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1165.6s)]
*  But I'll say this more broadly. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1167.16s)]
*  At the start of the new Congress, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1168.84s)]
*  and I actually spoke about this last week, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1170.16s)]
*  we're reaching out to all members in both parties [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1172.2s)]
*  to build relationships and establish points of contact. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1174.92s)]
*  That is something that the Office of Ledge Affairs [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1177.32s)]
*  has done for the past couple of weeks. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1179.76s)]
*  But this has been done. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1182.48s)]
*  When you talk about the debt ceiling, [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1184.2s)]
*  it has been done in a bipartisan way. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1185.7s)]
*  And there should be bipartisan cooperation to address this. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1188.12s)]
*  It should not be a political football. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1191.32s)]
*  This should not be a political football. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1193.4399999999998s)]
*  And we should do it without conditions. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1195.12s)]
*  Go ahead, Phil. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1196.6799999999998s)]
*  And I'll come to the back. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1197.56s)]
*  The president and his team had a pretty clear strategy, [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1198.8799999999999s)]
*  a list of goals heading into this year. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1200.9599999999998s)]
*  Is there any concern that that may be kind of overtaken [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1202.6399999999999s)]
*  by what's been happening over the course of the last week [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1205.4799999999998s)]
*  with the investigation? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1207.84s)]
*  I mean, I just talked about last week what [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1209.6s)]
*  we saw about with the economic plan. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1213.32s)]
*  We saw the CPI data, and it's showing that inflation [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1215.6s)]
*  is indeed going down because of the president's economic policy. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1218.6s)]
*  We have seen the president do bipartisan work, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1222.1999999999998s)]
*  bring both sides together when you think about going [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1225.7199999999998s)]
*  to the bridge in Kentucky. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1228.04s)]
*  And you saw that for yourselves, how the president was [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1229.84s)]
*  able to bring both sides together [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1232.8s)]
*  to talk about an issue that was so important for that region [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1234.24s)]
*  in Kentucky, to talk about infrastructure, something [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1237.9599999999998s)]
*  that many presidents before this president had tried to do [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1241.7199999999998s)]
*  and were not able to do it. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1245.0s)]
*  In the last administration, it was a punchline. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1246.48s)]
*  It was a joke when we talked about Infrastructure Week. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1248.48s)]
*  And now under this president, we've [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1251.2s)]
*  been able to do it in a bipartisan way. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1252.62s)]
*  Look, we're going to continue to do the work. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1255.16s)]
*  We're going to have mayors here in a couple of days. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1257.08s)]
*  We'll share more information about that event. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1259.58s)]
*  And the president will talk to Dan about the work [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1262.32s)]
*  that we are doing and the work that we're going to continue [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1264.96s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1267.76s)]
*  We went to Mexico City just about a week ago. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1269.04s)]
*  We were in Mexico City, feels like two weeks ago. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1272.52s)]
*  But yes, we were in Mexico City about a week ago. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1274.68s)]
*  And you saw the president on the world stage [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1277.4s)]
*  talking to our closest partners in North America [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1279.52s)]
*  about how we're going to deal with issues that [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1282.88s)]
*  matter to the American people. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1285.0s)]
*  And you saw the friendly engagement. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1286.88s)]
*  You saw how successful the NALSA, that summit was. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1288.72s)]
*  And so that's not going to stop the president. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1293.88s)]
*  He is very much focused on what are we [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1296.28s)]
*  going to do to lower cost? [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1299.26s)]
*  What are we going to do to continue to lower costs? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1301.4s)]
*  What are we going to do to continue to deliver [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1303.94s)]
*  for the American people? [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1306.02s)]
*  And let me add to what Republicans are putting forward. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1307.1000000000001s)]
*  House Republicans, the extreme members of the House, [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1310.54s)]
*  the MAGA Republicans, are talking [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1314.6200000000001s)]
*  about raising taxes for middle class Americans. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1316.78s)]
*  They're talking about giving a tax break [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1320.02s)]
*  for the wealthiest among us. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1323.22s)]
*  That's what they want to do. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1324.74s)]
*  They're talking about attacking women's rights to choose. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1326.8200000000002s)]
*  That's what they want to put forward. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1330.06s)]
*  And the president is going to speak against that as well [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1331.7s)]
*  and try to make sure that we deliver for the American people. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1335.06s)]
*  We can do both. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1337.5s)]
*  Should we assume the president weighed in on the issue [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1338.26s)]
*  a couple of times last week, but given the limitations, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1340.54s)]
*  given what you've talked about from the podium, [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1342.9s)]
*  that we shouldn't expect the president to give his thoughts [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1344.42s)]
*  or opinions on the ongoing investigation? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1347.18s)]
*  And you just said it's an ongoing matter, right? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1349.46s)]
*  This is an ongoing legal process that's happening currently. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1351.66s)]
*  And we are going to continue what we've [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1355.9s)]
*  been doing for the last two years, which [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1358.3400000000001s)]
*  is when it comes to the Department of Justice, when [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1360.42s)]
*  it comes to legal issues, we will not comment. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1362.6200000000001s)]
*  We are going to be prudent from here. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1365.0600000000002s)]
*  We are not going to politically interfere, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1366.74s)]
*  because one of the things that the president was very clear [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1369.94s)]
*  during the campaign and has been for the last two years [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1372.3400000000001s)]
*  is that we want to give back the independence [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1374.98s)]
*  that the Department of Justice has. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1379.3000000000002s)]
*  Go ahead, Peter. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1380.8200000000002s)]
*  And then I'll come to you. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1381.6200000000001s)]
*  Just to follow up, if I can, very quickly on this, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1382.74s)]
*  the White House says Republicans are faking outrage [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1385.02s)]
*  on this issue. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1388.0600000000002s)]
*  Why shouldn't Americans be outraged [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1388.86s)]
*  about classified documents being found in a garage? [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1390.78s)]
*  Look, and I think I've been very clear about this. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1394.74s)]
*  We have answered questions on this at this podium. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1398.3799999999999s)]
*  You've heard, as Phil was saying twice from the president, [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1401.74s)]
*  talk about this. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1404.4599999999998s)]
*  He said that he didn't know. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1405.9799999999998s)]
*  He said that he was surprised. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1408.54s)]
*  And he said that he takes classified information [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1409.9799999999998s)]
*  and documents very, very seriously. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1412.4199999999998s)]
*  We heard directly from the president on this issue. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1414.1399999999999s)]
*  Now, anything else, anything beyond that, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1417.94s)]
*  we're just not going to talk about. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1420.9s)]
*  There's an investigation going on. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1422.66s)]
*  There's a legal process here, as we've [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1424.38s)]
*  been very, very clear about. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1426.22s)]
*  I will let the White House counsel [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1427.8600000000001s)]
*  talk about any specific details about that. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1429.98s)]
*  But we're going to be prudent here [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1433.38s)]
*  and make sure that we are not interfering in this process. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1435.46s)]
*  I guess that's why I'm asking, though, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1438.3s)]
*  because you've said that you don't want to interfere here [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1439.46s)]
*  and be prudent about the process. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1441.14s)]
*  But the White House did post a statement [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1442.46s)]
*  saying that Republicans are faking outrage. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1444.18s)]
*  So to that point, why shouldn't Americans [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1446.78s)]
*  be upset about documents found in a garage? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1449.22s)]
*  That's for the American people to decide. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1453.26s)]
*  That is for you all, or I'm sure going [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1455.66s)]
*  to talk to many folks out there and have [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1457.62s)]
*  that this conversation. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1460.42s)]
*  But what we do know, what we do know from polling [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1461.3s)]
*  that we have seen over and over again, from your coverage, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1463.98s)]
*  from what we hear, what the president goes out and talks [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1467.1s)]
*  to the American people, they also care about the economy. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1469.94s)]
*  They also care about what is the president doing [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1473.3799999999999s)]
*  to lower costs, which is why he took historic action in making [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1475.5s)]
*  sure that gas prices went down at the gas pump. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1480.22s)]
*  And we saw that happen by more than $1.70. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1482.98s)]
*  And that's the work that the president's going to focus on. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1486.74s)]
*  You think about the inflation reduction. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1489.14s)]
*  That's going to lower, lower prescription costs, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1490.74s)]
*  lower medical costs, right, when you think about that, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1494.14s)]
*  lower energy costs. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1497.38s)]
*  So that's going to be our focus here. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1498.54s)]
*  We know that's what the American people truly care about as well. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1500.0s)]
*  And it is very important for them that we do that work. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1504.3s)]
*  I'm going to try and go to the back. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1507.4199999999998s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1508.94s)]
*  Thank you, Corinne. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1510.26s)]
*  Just back on the tanks, it seems that everybody's [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1511.78s)]
*  talking about tanks in the last few days. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1515.06s)]
*  In Europe, there's been a bunch of countries saying [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1516.94s)]
*  that I wanted to give tanks, or people should give tanks, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1519.02s)]
*  and then the Germans are being on the fence about it. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1521.26s)]
*  Everyone's talking about it. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1523.98s)]
*  Nothing's actually happening, apart from the Brits, [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1524.82s)]
*  who are, of course, not part of the European Union. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1526.94s)]
*  The president's positioned himself [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1528.8999999999999s)]
*  as the leader of this whole alliance, pretty much, right? [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1530.36s)]
*  Is this a moment when he feels maybe he should step in [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1534.26s)]
*  as the leader and either cajole, or you probably [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1537.1s)]
*  wouldn't want to use that word, but talk to the Germans, [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1541.02s)]
*  or go with the US tanks, the Abrams? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1544.98s)]
*  Is something going to happen in short? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1548.34s)]
*  Because this feels like a bit of a boiling point. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1550.46s)]
*  So a couple of things here. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1552.42s)]
*  And the president's view hasn't changed. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1553.9s)]
*  And I kind of said it when I was answering Zeke's question, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1556.58s)]
*  which is he believes that it's up to each country [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1559.3799999999999s)]
*  to make their own sovereign decisions here on what types [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1562.82s)]
*  of security assistance and what kinds of equipment [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1566.86s)]
*  they're able to provide Ukraine as Ukraine defends itself [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1569.6799999999998s)]
*  against Russia's brutal aggression. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1573.26s)]
*  For instance, we welcome Germany's recent announcement [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1576.8s)]
*  that they will send infantry fighting vehicles and Patriot [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1579.28s)]
*  missiles battery system to Ukraine. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1582.58s)]
*  We also support the decision by the UK, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1584.9399999999998s)]
*  as I was asked over the weekend to send challenger tanks [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1587.6599999999999s)]
*  to Ukraine. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1591.7s)]
*  We welcome that. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1592.3s)]
*  We have seen incredible solidarity [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1593.82s)]
*  by nations around the world to support Ukraine. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1596.1s)]
*  And also, I know that Secretary Austin [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1599.86s)]
*  is hosting another meeting of the Ukraine Contact Group, [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1602.4199999999998s)]
*  which is happening just this Friday, this week. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1606.6599999999999s)]
*  And we look forward to further discussions [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1609.5s)]
*  on how this broad coalition of allies and partners [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1611.3s)]
*  can continue to support Ukraine as Russia continues. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1615.22s)]
*  Again, continues this brutal war and barbaric war [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1617.9199999999998s)]
*  against the Ukrainian people. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1621.14s)]
*  But again, as I said at the top, it's [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1623.0200000000002s)]
*  up to each country to make their own decisions on this. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1626.48s)]
*  No Abrams. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1629.6200000000001s)]
*  Look, again, when it comes to these types of security [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1631.98s)]
*  assistance decision, it is up to each country [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1637.1000000000001s)]
*  to make that decision. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1639.7s)]
*  And we leave it to them. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1641.26s)]
*  OK, very good one on documents, Fyodamay. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1642.3000000000002s)]
*  Given these documents have shown up in very personal spaces, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1644.98s)]
*  we all know that the president loves his Delaware [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1647.4s)]
*  home. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1650.34s)]
*  It's an extremely personal space for him. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1650.84s)]
*  Is he physically joining in the search for these things, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1652.54s)]
*  rummaging around these boxes in the garage and wherever else? [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1655.62s)]
*  I mean, literally? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1658.3799999999999s)]
*  Are you listening to the question that you're asking me? [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1660.3799999999999s)]
*  No, it's a serious matter. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1663.4199999999998s)]
*  It's a serious matter. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1664.5s)]
*  I mean, it's a serious matter. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1665.34s)]
*  OK, look. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1666.54s)]
*  Is he taking part in searching for his own documents? [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1667.06s)]
*  Look, I'm going to be very consistent here. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1669.1s)]
*  I am going to be very clear here, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1672.02s)]
*  as I have been for the past couple of days, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1674.3s)]
*  almost a week now, dealing with this. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1677.14s)]
*  You know, we are going to any specific questions [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1680.66s)]
*  that you have about this issue, I [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1683.8600000000001s)]
*  would refer you to my colleagues at the White House [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1686.46s)]
*  Council's office who spent almost an hour taking [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1689.14s)]
*  these questions from all of you, many of your colleagues. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1692.78s)]
*  I'm going to let you ask that question to the White House [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1695.5s)]
*  Council's office. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1698.1s)]
*  And anything else specific to this, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1699.54s)]
*  I refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1701.74s)]
*  I refer you to Special Counsel. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1703.42s)]
*  Ken. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1705.58s)]
*  On Monday, in regards to police shootings, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1706.78s)]
*  the president said, I think I did the only thing I can do. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1710.9s)]
*  Is it the opinion of the White House [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1715.06s)]
*  that there will be no more progress on the issue [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1716.78s)]
*  of police reform going forward, that there's just [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1719.46s)]
*  nothing more to do? [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1722.38s)]
*  Look, the president has been very clear in asking Congress [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1724.02s)]
*  to take action. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1727.34s)]
*  He has taken executive action. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1728.66s)]
*  I'm sure you've covered a lot of the actions [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1731.1s)]
*  that he's taken the past two years. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1733.66s)]
*  And he believes it's now in the hands of Congress [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1735.7s)]
*  to take action. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1739.5s)]
*  And it is important to do just that. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1740.74s)]
*  And I will leave it there. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1743.82s)]
*  One more. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1746.06s)]
*  Stephen Curry, up on a first name basis now, apparently. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1746.5800000000002s)]
*  I know. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1749.14s)]
*  Buddies. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1749.66s)]
*  You guys are buddies. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1750.38s)]
*  They don't even let me call them Stephen Curry. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1751.26s)]
*  He mentioned the bring of Brittany Greiner. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1753.78s)]
*  But does the White House have any comment [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1755.74s)]
*  on the detention of Siamat Namazi, who's in Iran, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1757.94s)]
*  and on hunger strike, and sent a letter to the president? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1760.82s)]
*  So we've received the letter. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1764.3799999999999s)]
*  And our thoughts are with Namazi and his family. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1765.86s)]
*  We remain committed to securing his freedom. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1770.1999999999998s)]
*  And the US government is continuing [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1772.82s)]
*  to work to bring him home, along with US citizens who [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1774.26s)]
*  are wrongfully detained in Iran, including [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1778.6599999999999s)]
*  Imad Shagri and Marad Tabas. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1781.82s)]
*  Iran's use of wrongful detention as political leverage [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1785.54s)]
*  is outrageous. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1789.22s)]
*  The US will always stand for our citizens overseas. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1790.98s)]
*  We've been very clear about that and committed. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1794.78s)]
*  And you've seen the president take action. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1796.8200000000002s)]
*  And you've heard the president say that directly. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1799.5s)]
*  One of our highest priorities is bringing all of our wrongfully [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1802.74s)]
*  detained citizens home safely as soon as possible, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1805.8200000000002s)]
*  and resolving the cases of missing and abducted US [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1809.5s)]
*  citizens. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1812.78s)]
*  So this will continue to be a priority [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1813.38s)]
*  for the American people, for the president. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1815.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1817.02s)]
*  Does the White House have any reaction to the arrest [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1818.3400000000001s)]
*  in New Mexico of a former Republican candidate [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1820.34s)]
*  for the state house there, who was allegedly [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1822.62s)]
*  organizing men to shoot at the homes of four [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1824.3799999999999s)]
*  Democratic elected officials? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1827.8999999999999s)]
*  Don't have a comment on that at this time. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1830.3s)]
*  I heard the stories. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1832.74s)]
*  I just need to check with the team to get the full rundown. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1834.26s)]
*  But I don't have a comment at this time on that. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1837.22s)]
*  OK, Lucia. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1839.58s)]
*  Thanks, Karine. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1840.08s)]
*  I'm going to follow up on Cecilia's question. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1840.98s)]
*  And sorry if I missed it. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1843.06s)]
*  But on Friday, did you or did you not [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1844.22s)]
*  know about the additional fire? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1847.22s)]
*  Irene, I literally just answered that question. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1849.02s)]
*  But I missed it. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1852.34s)]
*  So is it yes or no? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1853.26s)]
*  I mean, you're not too far sitting next to her. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1854.34s)]
*  So I was very clear. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1857.18s)]
*  I provided the information that you all had at the time. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1859.5s)]
*  And I confirmed. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1863.3799999999999s)]
*  No, I did not know. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1864.26s)]
*  I'm saying I had the information. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1865.3s)]
*  I actually said this to Cecilia. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1866.9s)]
*  I had the information that you all had at the time. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1868.3799999999999s)]
*  And so this is why I also said to Cecilia, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1871.9s)]
*  this is why we are trying to be very prudent here. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1874.34s)]
*  And we're trying to be very consistent [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1876.98s)]
*  and say this is an ongoing legal process. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1878.54s)]
*  And this is why I say we're just not [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1882.58s)]
*  going to comment from here. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1885.06s)]
*  That is a perfect example in Cecilia's question. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1886.22s)]
*  And I was very clear about that. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1888.82s)]
*  When did you learn about the documents found at the Penn [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1890.58s)]
*  Center in November and in Wilmington in December? [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1893.82s)]
*  When your team was doing a story on it. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1897.78s)]
*  Because I was also asked a similar question [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1903.02s)]
*  about if our team has been engaged on this. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1905.1399999999999s)]
*  And I've been very clear. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1908.5s)]
*  This is something that the White House counsel is handling. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1909.94s)]
*  This is something that is being handled [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1913.22s)]
*  by the president's lawyers. [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1915.5s)]
*  I've been very clear. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1917.14s)]
*  This is why we are being prudent here. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1918.78s)]
*  This is why we are being consistent with what [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1920.98s)]
*  we have done the last two years when [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1923.0600000000002s)]
*  it comes to DOJ, Department of Justice, investigation. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1924.46s)]
*  We are just not going to interfere. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1927.9s)]
*  Well, on that note, you've repeatedly [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1931.38s)]
*  emphasized the need, just as you did today, for independence, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1934.62s)]
*  for integrity of the Department of Justice investigation. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1938.6999999999998s)]
*  One reason why you continue to point us to the DOJ. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1944.86s)]
*  So I wonder why then did the White House counsel [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1947.9399999999998s)]
*  go to Wilmington to facilitate the handing over [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1952.5s)]
*  of documents to the DOJ? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1955.9399999999998s)]
*  That is a separate. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1958.46s)]
*  That is separating the White House from the DOJ. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1960.34s)]
*  And, Weijia, I appreciate the questions. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1962.74s)]
*  I know there's going to continue to be dozens more questions [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1964.34s)]
*  probably today. [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1967.1799999999998s)]
*  And I will say, reach out to the White House counsel's office. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1968.1799999999998s)]
*  That's one of the reasons my colleague was [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1972.8999999999999s)]
*  on the phone with many of you taking questions today. [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1975.58s)]
*  And I'm just going to leave it there. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1979.3s)]
*  That is something for them to answer. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1980.84s)]
*  OK, but it's related to something [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1982.82s)]
*  that you keep telling us, which is how much it is important [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1986.1s)]
*  to this White House to separate the White House from the DOJ's [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1989.3799999999999s)]
*  investigation. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1992.54s)]
*  But the White House counsel was the one [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1993.62s)]
*  to go and facilitate the documents, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1996.5s)]
*  to look for the documents. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=1998.54s)]
*  Again, they have been working very closely [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2000.2199999999998s)]
*  with the Department of Justice. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2002.4599999999998s)]
*  I would refer you to them. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2003.9399999999998s)]
*  If you want to know specifically about their actions, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2005.4199999999998s)]
*  specifically about what they're doing, [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2008.2199999999998s)]
*  I would point you to the White House counsel's office. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2010.1799999999998s)]
*  Look, guys, you guys can ask me this 100 times, 200 times, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2012.26s)]
*  if you wish. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2016.78s)]
*  I'm going to keep saying the same thing. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2017.6999999999998s)]
*  I hear your question. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2019.9799999999998s)]
*  It's been asked. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2020.8999999999999s)]
*  It's been answered. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2021.78s)]
*  It's been noted. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2022.58s)]
*  And we're just going to try to move on here. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2023.5s)]
*  And we're going to move on. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2025.82s)]
*  We're going to move on. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2027.3s)]
*  We're going to move on. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2028.18s)]
*  One more. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2029.18s)]
*  You gave up false information. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2029.68s)]
*  We're going to move on. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2030.54s)]
*  One more, because Ian did have that call today. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2031.22s)]
*  And he said that the White House would, quote, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2033.22s)]
*  fully cooperate with the investigation. [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2035.42s)]
*  Does that mean that President Biden is [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2038.3s)]
*  willing to be interviewed if called on? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2041.54s)]
*  I'm just not going to. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2043.74s)]
*  You're asking a question that should go to the White House [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2044.8600000000001s)]
*  counsel's office. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2048.5s)]
*  As you just said, Ian, you spoke to my colleague [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2049.18s)]
*  just moments ago. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2052.5s)]
*  That is something that the White House counsel's office [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2053.54s)]
*  should be answering. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2055.7s)]
*  Anything specific to the DOJ or special counsel, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2057.78s)]
*  what they're doing, you need to reach out to them. [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2062.54s)]
*  Go ahead, Tam. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2065.26s)]
*  Are you upset that you came out to this podium on Friday [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2067.22s)]
*  with incomplete and inaccurate information? [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2070.14s)]
*  And are you concerned that it affects your credibility [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2073.46s)]
*  up here? [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2075.98s)]
*  Well, what I'm concerned about is making sure [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2076.54s)]
*  that we do not politically interfere [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2078.98s)]
*  in the Department of Justice, that we continue [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2081.22s)]
*  to be consistent over the last two years. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2083.74s)]
*  And that is continue to refer you all when [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2086.14s)]
*  it comes to an ongoing process. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2089.5s)]
*  And I'll just leave it there. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2093.18s)]
*  And let's not forget, there was actually [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2094.58s)]
*  a statement from the counsel's office [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2096.22s)]
*  that you all had at the same time as well. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2099.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm just not going to go down any rabbit hole here. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2101.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm going to be very consistent. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2105.2999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to be very prudent. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2106.62s)]
*  And again, I've been asked just ask that question. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2108.02s)]
*  I've answered it. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2112.14s)]
*  It's been noted, the question. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2113.5s)]
*  And we're just going to move on. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2115.34s)]
*  Go ahead, JJ. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2116.62s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2117.66s)]
*  So just to clarify on the debt ceiling again, [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2118.16s)]
*  so the White House has no intention [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2120.2599999999998s)]
*  of sitting down with Leader McCarthy on the debt ceiling [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2122.34s)]
*  in the coming month or at all? [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2125.22s)]
*  What we're saying here is that we've been very, very clear. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2128.66s)]
*  I was clear at the top. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2132.66s)]
*  I was clear when I was just asked this question. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2133.7s)]
*  Congress is going to need to address the debt [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2135.98s)]
*  without conditions. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2138.98s)]
*  And it's just that simple. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2141.78s)]
*  There should be no hostiles taking here. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2144.58s)]
*  There should be no attempts to exploit the debt ceiling [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2146.86s)]
*  or to leverage it. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2150.34s)]
*  We're going to be very, very clear about that. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2152.26s)]
*  And again, and I said this before, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2155.26s)]
*  this was done three times under the last administration [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2157.18s)]
*  in a bipartisan way. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2161.62s)]
*  This is the duty of Congress. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2163.2200000000003s)]
*  This is something that is their basic duty [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2165.46s)]
*  to deal with the debt ceiling. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2168.18s)]
*  And so we're going to continue to be consistent here [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2170.62s)]
*  about that. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2172.7s)]
*  And again, there should be no, this should not [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2173.86s)]
*  be used as a political football. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2176.58s)]
*  So we can accurately report that the White House isn't [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2178.54s)]
*  doing any outreach to Republicans at this time? [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2180.94s)]
*  I have said, I said just moments ago, one of the things [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2183.54s)]
*  that we did, and I laid this out pretty clearly [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2186.18s)]
*  when the new Congress started, we [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2188.94s)]
*  reached out to Republicans and Democrats alike [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2190.34s)]
*  to talk about who their point of contact is, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2193.94s)]
*  to have that conversation, to figure out [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2196.2200000000003s)]
*  how we're going to work together. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2198.1s)]
*  And so there is constant conversations [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2199.9s)]
*  happening with members of Congress and their team. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2202.9s)]
*  That is something that we are doing almost on a certainly [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2207.2200000000003s)]
*  a weekly basis. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2211.82s)]
*  And that always is going to happen. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2213.3s)]
*  Those conversations are always going to happen. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2214.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm certainly not going to read out every conversation [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2216.66s)]
*  that we're having with congressional members [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2219.18s)]
*  or congressional staff. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2222.26s)]
*  What I am saying is that we have been very clear [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2223.62s)]
*  that this should be done. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2226.18s)]
*  We're talking about the debt ceiling. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2227.8199999999997s)]
*  It should be done without conditions, [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2229.62s)]
*  and it should not be used as a political football. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2232.3399999999997s)]
*  I just wanted to go back to the bilat earlier and the one [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2236.7s)]
*  last week with the Prime Minister of Japan. [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2240.06s)]
*  These are two countries that are huge players [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2241.98s)]
*  in the semiconductor chain. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2244.74s)]
*  Have you made any progress in getting those countries [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2246.5s)]
*  to join the efforts that the US has started [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2250.54s)]
*  to restrict China's access to those semiconductors, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2253.1s)]
*  to that technology? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2256.46s)]
*  So I just want to be very clear on this as well. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2257.38s)]
*  We don't push any of our allies or our partners. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2260.1s)]
*  We consult with them closely, and they [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2262.74s)]
*  make their own decisions. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2265.3399999999997s)]
*  And this is how we move forward with our relationship, again, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2266.7s)]
*  with our allies and partners. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2270.42s)]
*  We all recognize the importance of this issue [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2271.98s)]
*  to national security, and the president did discuss it, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2273.98s)]
*  along with a host of other important regional and global [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2277.94s)]
*  issues. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2281.06s)]
*  This is going to be a continuing part of a group consultation [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2282.2599999999998s)]
*  here, and I don't have any announcements to make [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2285.7799999999997s)]
*  or anything further to share on this. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2288.8599999999997s)]
*  Does the president feel that the US [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2290.7799999999997s)]
*  can be successful in preventing China [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2293.02s)]
*  from getting that technology if these types of countries, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2296.18s)]
*  like the Netherlands, like Japan, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2299.02s)]
*  don't join even if it's not exactly the same restrictions, [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2301.14s)]
*  but don't join in those types of efforts? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2304.58s)]
*  Again, we're just not going to push our partners and allies [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2307.18s)]
*  here. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2310.4199999999996s)]
*  Again, the president did come up in their conversation. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2311.46s)]
*  I'm just not going to get into specific conversations [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2314.7400000000002s)]
*  of what happened or what was said. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2321.1s)]
*  What we believe is that our close allies and partners [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2322.7s)]
*  make their own decisions on these types of things. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2326.42s)]
*  Is there a bipartisan plan for our youth today? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2331.14s)]
*  Do we have a focus on either education? [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2335.7s)]
*  Are we looking at, I just wanted to soften the voodoo [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2338.2200000000003s)]
*  a little bit in the room. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2340.7s)]
*  But is there anything that we're focusing on [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2342.46s)]
*  in terms of education, in terms of funding, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2344.22s)]
*  funding programs that we've come to the table to agree upon? [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2346.14s)]
*  Well, thank you for your question. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2350.22s)]
*  Look, the Department of Education, [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2351.58s)]
*  which is leading on that, on education [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2355.1s)]
*  and what we're doing to deliver for young people, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2357.8199999999997s)]
*  certainly is a priority for this president [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2360.62s)]
*  and for the Department of Education. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2364.1s)]
*  Don't have any specific programs or new programs [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2365.8999999999996s)]
*  to announce from here. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2367.9399999999996s)]
*  But that is making sure that young people have [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2369.54s)]
*  what they need to have a good, strong education, of course, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2373.62s)]
*  is a priority for this president. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2377.98s)]
*  Let's not forget the first lady is an educator herself. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2379.9s)]
*  And she talks about that and has done the work as well [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2384.06s)]
*  as first lady on the things that this administration is doing [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2389.5s)]
*  to move that ball forward. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2392.94s)]
*  Again, don't have anything specific to share. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2395.5s)]
*  But clearly, it's a priority for us and our young people [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2398.02s)]
*  across our millions and millions of young people [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2401.46s)]
*  across the country to make sure that they have just [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2403.38s)]
*  and fair opportunities that they should have. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2408.54s)]
*  Thanks, Greene. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2411.82s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2413.82s)]
*  I'll come to you later. [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2414.32s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Greene. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2415.22s)]
*  So I'm going to ask you about trade. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2416.26s)]
*  We're days away now from the president being [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2418.58s)]
*  two years in office. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2420.78s)]
*  And there have been no completed trade deals. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2422.14s)]
*  Why not? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2424.38s)]
*  So a couple of things here. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2425.14s)]
*  So when the president was running, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2428.3799999999997s)]
*  he made clear that we will invest [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2429.8599999999997s)]
*  in American workers and communities [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2433.06s)]
*  before pursuing new trade deals. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2434.8199999999997s)]
*  And this is exactly what we've been doing. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2437.3799999999997s)]
*  You've seen it for yourselves. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2439.3799999999997s)]
*  You've heard the investments that have been made, [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2440.8199999999997s)]
*  especially as you think about manufacturing coming back [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2444.02s)]
*  to the US. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2447.2599999999998s)]
*  And that is exactly what we're going to continue to do. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2448.3799999999997s)]
*  So you've seen our economic agenda [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2451.2599999999998s)]
*  for historic recovery and a manufacturing boom at home. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2452.9s)]
*  More than 750,000 manufacturing jobs [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2456.3s)]
*  were created right here under this president. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2460.14s)]
*  At the same time, we are working. [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2463.38s)]
*  Most of the jobs added back up. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2465.54s)]
*  They created 149,000. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2466.86s)]
*  We go back and forth on this, Ed. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2468.62s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2470.1800000000003s)]
*  I'm 750,000 jobs. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2471.1800000000003s)]
*  Let me finish your answer. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2473.6600000000003s)]
*  You asked me a question. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2474.9s)]
*  But at the same time, we are working swiftly [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2476.14s)]
*  to finalize the Indo-Pacific economic framework, which [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2478.4s)]
*  represent 40% of the world GDP, and will [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2481.38s)]
*  address the core issues that will define much of our success [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2484.42s)]
*  in the coming decades, like clean energy [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2488.2200000000003s)]
*  and the digital economy, while fortifying our economies [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2490.7400000000002s)]
*  against a range of threats from fragile supply chains [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2494.2200000000003s)]
*  to tax havens. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2496.98s)]
*  We are committed in every region of the world [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2498.58s)]
*  to strengthen trade and investment in a manner that [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2501.2200000000003s)]
*  promotes good paying American jobs, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2503.86s)]
*  and also high standards and supply chain resiliency. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2507.82s)]
*  And that has been the president's priority. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2511.98s)]
*  At every step of the way, we will work with Congress [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2514.02s)]
*  to negotiate and develop trade policies that [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2517.1800000000003s)]
*  advance the interests of all Americans, [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2520.06s)]
*  support US innovation and workers, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2522.34s)]
*  and enhance our competitiveness. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2524.2200000000003s)]
*  And that has been the president's priority. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2526.1400000000003s)]
*  That is what he talked about during the campaign. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2528.36s)]
*  And that's what he's been doing and delivering [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2530.4s)]
*  on for the past two years. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2532.26s)]
*  Go around. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2535.1800000000003s)]
*  Go ahead, April. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2536.02s)]
*  Kareem, two questions. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2537.42s)]
*  You just, from the podium, in an answer [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2539.1800000000003s)]
*  to one of the reporters, you said something [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2541.5s)]
*  about you don't want to politically interfere [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2544.1400000000003s)]
*  when it comes to this investigation on the documents. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2547.3s)]
*  I asked you when we first heard about the documents, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2552.26s)]
*  there is a political component and the legal component. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2556.6200000000003s)]
*  But can you expound upon what you don't want to interfere [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2559.7000000000003s)]
*  on politically? [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2563.5s)]
*  Because many pundits, many lawyers, many politicians [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2564.82s)]
*  are saying that this is also an issue that [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2569.3s)]
*  could prohibit a lot of work with the 118th Congress, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2573.02s)]
*  a lot of work for the American people in this moment. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2579.02s)]
*  Could you expound on what you were talking about? [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2581.94s)]
*  Well, look, I'm not going to get into politics from here. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2584.6600000000003s)]
*  And I've been very clear about that. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2589.8s)]
*  I've answered that question multiple times already. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2591.94s)]
*  What I can say is that the president's [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2595.06s)]
*  going to stay laser focused on delivering [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2598.3s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2600.78s)]
*  And that's going to continue to be the work [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2602.46s)]
*  that he sees at hand when it comes to the economy, [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2605.5s)]
*  when it comes to the bipartisan infrastructure legislation, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2608.9s)]
*  when it comes to implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2611.9s)]
*  which we announced a couple of items last week [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2615.34s)]
*  on how important it's going to be for Medicare [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2618.82s)]
*  to negotiate. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2621.5s)]
*  That is something that is going to be critical [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2622.18s)]
*  for the American families, for American people [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2624.94s)]
*  across the country, being able to negotiate the price of drugs [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2627.06s)]
*  and tap it, cap it at $2,000 a year. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2631.42s)]
*  That's going to make a difference in people's lives, [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2636.66s)]
*  continuing to do the work that he has been doing to lower [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2639.22s)]
*  cost. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2642.46s)]
*  And we've seen that. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2642.98s)]
*  We've seen that the president's economic plan is indeed working. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2643.78s)]
*  And so look, that is not going to stop us. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2648.26s)]
*  That is something we're going to continue to talk about. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2650.98s)]
*  And you're seeing how the work that he's put in, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2653.82s)]
*  the last two years, his administration, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2658.34s)]
*  the work that he's done with Congress [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2660.42s)]
*  in a bipartisan way in historic fashions, is actually working. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2661.98s)]
*  And so that's going to be our focus. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2666.14s)]
*  And last question. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2667.62s)]
*  In this moment, there are Democrats [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2669.14s)]
*  who are saying they're looking to tomorrow. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2672.42s)]
*  It's a bright spot for Democrats. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2674.38s)]
*  With the inauguration of Westmoor [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2676.58s)]
*  as Maryland's first black governor, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2679.14s)]
*  as the third black elected governor in the nation, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2681.2599999999998s)]
*  what does the president say, and what does this White House say [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2686.14s)]
*  about his elevation, this citizen who [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2688.8199999999997s)]
*  rose to the highest heights in the state of Maryland, [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2691.18s)]
*  especially as he campaigned for him? [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2693.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, the president is very much looking forward to working [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2695.86s)]
*  with Governor Westmoor. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2698.5s)]
*  And you saw the governor. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2702.02s)]
*  I don't know if he's a governor-elect yet, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2704.54s)]
*  or has he been a governor-elect. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2706.46s)]
*  I want to give him the right title here. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2708.58s)]
*  And you saw Westmoor, governor-elect Westmoor, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2711.38s)]
*  and the president many times over the last several months. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2714.18s)]
*  They developed a friendship. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2717.58s)]
*  The president is very much looking forward [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2718.82s)]
*  to working with him. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2720.58s)]
*  And we think it's important. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2722.3s)]
*  It's important to have that representation. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2723.94s)]
*  It's important to have someone who [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2726.02s)]
*  is qualified and passionate about the work as Westmoor [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2729.5s)]
*  be in a position where he can make a change [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2734.18s)]
*  and make a difference for mail lenders. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2736.22s)]
*  And so that is critically important. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2738.3399999999997s)]
*  Look, there is bright spots. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2741.2599999999998s)]
*  There are just, if you look across the country, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2743.8199999999997s)]
*  what we saw in state elections and what [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2746.06s)]
*  we saw with governorships, what we saw in other really key, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2748.8999999999996s)]
*  important state offices, it was a bright spot. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2753.8599999999997s)]
*  And let's not forget, one of the reasons that we saw that [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2759.2599999999998s)]
*  is because of the president's plan, the president's agenda, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2762.22s)]
*  and what he was able to set forth for the midterms. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2765.82s)]
*  Remember, everyone was talking about the red wave. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2768.6600000000003s)]
*  And that didn't happen. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2771.1800000000003s)]
*  And that didn't happen because of the president's leadership. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2772.5800000000004s)]
*  Corrine? [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2775.78s)]
*  Corrine? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2776.78s)]
*  Corrine? [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2777.28s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2777.78s)]
*  Thank you, Corrine. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2778.3s)]
*  Just wanted to ask you, sir, I just [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2778.98s)]
*  want to ask you about something you said last week. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2780.42s)]
*  Last week, you were pretty insistent [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2782.7400000000002s)]
*  that you believed that the president's attorneys did [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2784.02s)]
*  the right thing. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2786.34s)]
*  Do you still believe that? [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2787.5s)]
*  Yes, they did the right thing when [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2788.7000000000003s)]
*  it comes to making sure that when the documents were found, [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2790.46s)]
*  they handed it over to the archivist. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2794.46s)]
*  And it was handed over to the Department of Justice. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2797.62s)]
*  But again, Steve, I'm going to be very prudent here. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2799.98s)]
*  I am going to be very consistent. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2803.14s)]
*  It is an ongoing legal process. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2805.82s)]
*  I'm not going to say more. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2808.46s)]
*  The reason I ask is that what we now know, [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2809.82s)]
*  the president's counsel statement, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2811.7400000000002s)]
*  the president's personal lawyer statement, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2813.7s)]
*  shed a bit more light on this, but they raised more questions. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2815.66s)]
*  Namely, the first call that the president's personal attorneys [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2818.42s)]
*  on November 2nd was not to the FBI [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2823.2200000000003s)]
*  that they had found what we now know were top secret documents [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2826.5s)]
*  out in the open. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2829.0600000000004s)]
*  The first call was to officials here at this White House [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2830.0600000000004s)]
*  in the West Wing. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2832.9s)]
*  How is that the right thing? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2834.0200000000004s)]
*  Is that the right thing when you see some, if you're a lawyer [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2835.5s)]
*  and you don't have a security clearance [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2837.86s)]
*  and you see a classified document, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2839.78s)]
*  shouldn't you call the Justice Department's National Security [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2841.1400000000003s)]
*  Office right away? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2843.86s)]
*  Again, I'm going to refer you to the White House Counsel's [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2844.7000000000003s)]
*  Office. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2846.6600000000003s)]
*  That is something for them to answer. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2846.94s)]
*  That is a very specific question that they should answer, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2848.62s)]
*  that they will engage with on you on this, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2852.7s)]
*  just like my colleague did for almost an hour [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2856.2999999999997s)]
*  and had this conversation with all of you. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2858.54s)]
*  It was about a half hour, but let me widen out. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2860.22s)]
*  Why is it the matter of this White House Counsel [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2862.7s)]
*  to deal with documents from two administrations ago? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2866.9s)]
*  These are, we're not talking about presidential records [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2870.38s)]
*  from this White House. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2872.34s)]
*  Why is this White House Counsel involved in this matter at all? [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2873.22s)]
*  Again, this is something for the White House Counsel [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2876.22s)]
*  to address. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2878.38s)]
*  I am not going to address that from here. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2879.3s)]
*  I will refer you to them, and I will [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2881.02s)]
*  refer you to the special counsel and anything that [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2882.54s)]
*  is specific to this particular issue. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2885.1400000000003s)]
*  Really? [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2886.94s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2887.44s)]
*  We're being pulled. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2887.94s)]
*  We have to, folks have to gather. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2890.1400000000003s)]
*  OK. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2891.46s)]
*  Folks have to gather. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2891.96s)]
*  I'll see you guys tomorrow. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2892.82s)]
*  You told me six times that turned out to be false. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2893.9s)]
*  Are you sorry about that? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2897.1800000000003s)]
*  I'll see you tomorrow. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2898.98s)]
*  Come talk to me. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2900.2200000000003s)]
*  I'll see you tomorrow. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pycEA6wqYnE&t=2901.38s)]
