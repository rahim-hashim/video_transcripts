# ‘KABUL 2.0?’: GOP rep. sounds alarm as Americans ‘stranded’ in Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E)
*  Well, hundreds of Americans stuck in Gaza may be able to leave today through the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=0.0s)]
*  Rafa border crossing into Egypt after it opened for the first time since the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=3.84s)]
*  Hamas attacks on Israel. Our next guest, Congressman Zach Nunn, sent a letter to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=8.32s)]
*  Secretary of State Antony Blinken two weeks ago, stating, My office has [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=12.48s)]
*  received outreach from several Iowans requesting evacuation assistance for [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=16.32s)]
*  U. S. Citizens who reside in my district but are currently trapped in Gaza under [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Hamas rule. Congressman Nunn joining us now with an update. How many of your [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=24.68s)]
*  constituents are there? What's the latest? Do you think they'll get out [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=29.76s)]
*  today? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=32.96s)]
*  Dana Bill, thanks so much. You know, this is the challenge we had over a dozen [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  Iowans who were trapped in Israel. Pastor Goodwin and his family. We were [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=38.64s)]
*  able to get out almost immediately, working directly as a military guy [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=42.36s)]
*  myself, having a plan to evacuate them. Gaza has been an entirely different [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  story. I've got a woman in Des Moines who is a U. S. Citizen went to see [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=51.06s)]
*  ailing family members who are on their deathbed and they got trapped in this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=55.32000000000001s)]
*  crossfire. And now, after a terrorist attack by Hamas on Israel has been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=58.96s)]
*  stranded in Gaza for weeks. There's only one land crossing that's into Egypt. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=64.16s)]
*  And the real question we have here is, has the United States State Department [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=70.12s)]
*  been in conversation with Egypt about evacuating these people? And if they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=74.36s)]
*  have, then why haven't they informed Congress? So yesterday we saw the Biden [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=78.0s)]
*  administration take a victory lap, if you will, on evacuating Palestinians. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=82.28s)]
*  We still have hundreds and hundreds of Americans trapped in Gaza with no plan [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=86.84s)]
*  for evacuation on where they are, how they're going to get out, and then what [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=91.44s)]
*  happens to them once they cross into the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt to be able to [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  get back home on American soil. So the number we have right now is 400 with [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  regard to the Americans there. Here's the president. He was in Minnesota [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=103.5s)]
*  yesterday and talked about a group of 1000. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=107.72s)]
*  Thanks to concerted American leadership, we're in a situation where safe passage [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=110.28s)]
*  for wounded Palestinians and foreign nationals to exit Gaza has started. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=117.52s)]
*  American citizens are able to exit today as part of the first group of probably [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=123.68s)]
*  over 1000. So a group of 1000, we'll see how many Americans are in there. What I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=128.96s)]
*  find interesting is that the Israeli government today, sir, is asking foreign [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=135.12s)]
*  countries if they could bring cruise liners to the eastern Mediterranean [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=140.44s)]
*  that could be used as hospitals to treat the wounded who come out of Gaza. If [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=145.76s)]
*  you're able to get a deal on that, that could be significant because the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=150.76s)]
*  Egyptians help the Israelis seal that border. It's a hard thing to say, but [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=154.56s)]
*  the Egyptians don't want Palestinians crossing into the Sinai Desert because [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=161.6s)]
*  they know it'll be their responsibility and some of them could be Hamas. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=166.51999999999998s)]
*  Bill, I think you're absolutely correct on this. No country wants to invite [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=172.2s)]
*  Hamas into its territories. We saw what it did in Israel. We saw the just [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=175.72s)]
*  barbaric behavior. Now, what I am concerned about is that the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=179.51999999999998s)]
*  administration not having an actual plan on what to do, particularly with the [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=183.12s)]
*  American citizens who are trapped. I was involved. I did multiple combat tours [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=186.51999999999998s)]
*  in Afghanistan. We saw the withdrawal. I lost a young corporal from my district [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=190.88s)]
*  in the failed and debauched evacuation from Afghanistan. We don't want this to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=196.44s)]
*  be Kabul 2.0 in Gaza where Americans are left behind. And so while we were able, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=201.4s)]
*  as private citizens, to help get thousands of Americans out and our [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=206.51999999999998s)]
*  allies from Afghanistan, this is a situation where we have two carrier [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=210.24s)]
*  strike groups in the Middle East right now evacuating Americans and being able [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=214.2s)]
*  to have them, whether it's on a cruise ship or a U.S. flag ship, to be able to [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=218.12s)]
*  vet who's coming out of Gaza, make sure they have the medical access that they [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=222.76s)]
*  need, but also not inadvertently allowing Hamas to pour out of the country, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=226.28s)]
*  whether it's across the Egyptian border or potentially even the southern border [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=230.32s)]
*  of the United States, to come here if left unvetted. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=233.79999999999998s)]
*  Congressman, both Israel and Ukraine are in need of funds, and the new speaker, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=237.32s)]
*  Mike Johnson, has put forward an Israel-only bill. But here's the Wall [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=243.6s)]
*  Street Journal editorial board saying that the Ukraine-Israel test for U.S. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=246.64s)]
*  democracy is this, that the Senate may be tempted to jam the House with a single [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=250.44s)]
*  bill, but the risk is ending up with nothing, which is the worst outcome. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=254.88s)]
*  No one will remember if the aid passes as one bill or several. Is that how you [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=260.08s)]
*  see it? No, not at all. I think this is a situation where it's very clear and the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=264.96s)]
*  speaker's done a good job on this, is that we need to have a sole source of [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=269.6s)]
*  funding directly to Israel right now to supply Iron Dome, to be able to help U.S. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=273.24s)]
*  military elements resupply. And we're going to take that money directly from [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=278.36s)]
*  overspending that came out of the IRA to fund more tax agents. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=282.4s)]
*  This is making sure that we're not only securing our international borders, but [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=286.44s)]
*  we're also looking at a real responsibility here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=290.68s)]
*  The greatest national security threat to the United States right now isn't coming [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=292.84s)]
*  from Moscow or even Tehran. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=296.88s)]
*  It's coming because of our massive national debt. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=298.76s)]
*  And so we've got to make sure that we're not just spending more taxpayer dollars [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=301.40000000000003s)]
*  on security without addressing the situations at home. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  A clean spending bill that pays for our aid to Israel, which is imperative, must [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=307.92s)]
*  also come to make sure that we're not asking U.S. taxpayers to pay more. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=312.64s)]
*  That's what a single bill does. Look, I came to Washington to fight the headaches [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=315.96000000000004s)]
*  on both sides and I am focused on pragmatic solutions. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=320.0s)]
*  This is a pragmatic solution that helps our allies, but also ensures that [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=323.40000000000003s)]
*  taxpayers are on the hook for a forever conflict. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=327.2s)]
*  Sir, thank you for your time. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=330.52s)]
*  We'll speak again. A lot to cover. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=332.28000000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Republican from Iowa. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjvRuQJlW2E&t=333.8s)]
