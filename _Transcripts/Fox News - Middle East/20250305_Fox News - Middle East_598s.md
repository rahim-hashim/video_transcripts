# Marco Rubio: Only Trump can make this possible
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns)
*  Last night, President Trump said he had received some outreach from Ukrainian President Zelensky. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=0.0s)]
*  Sounds like he's ready to get back to the negotiating table. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=4.88s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=7.92s)]
*  Earlier today, I received an important letter from President Zelensky of Ukraine. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=8.92s)]
*  The letter reads, Ukraine is ready to come to the negotiating table as soon as possible [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=15.0s)]
*  to bring lasting peace closer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=20.52s)]
*  Nobody wants peace more than the Ukrainians, he said. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  My team and I stand ready to work under President Trump's strong leadership to get a peace that lasts. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=26.759999999999998s)]
*  We do really value how much America has done to help Ukraine maintain its sovereignty and independence. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=35.16s)]
*  Regarding the agreement on minerals and security, Ukraine is ready to sign it at any time. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=42.72s)]
*  That is convenient for you. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=49.4s)]
*  I appreciate that he sent this letter just a little while ago. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=51.6s)]
*  This says President Trump has temporarily cut off military funding to and intelligence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=56.92s)]
*  sharing with Ukraine, but those moves could be reversed very soon. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=61.6s)]
*  Here with the very latest, our Secretary of State Marco Rubio is with us. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, good to have you. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=71.48s)]
*  You were in the room last Friday. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=72.92s)]
*  It was somewhat surreal. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=75.76s)]
*  I said on Friday, and I think I've been proven correct, that he will be back. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=77.88s)]
*  That letter and that post on X yesterday said everything that I think needed to be said [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=83.08s)]
*  to get this thing back on track. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=88.88s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=91.8s)]
*  Well, I think the important thing to understand about last Friday is not last Friday, it's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=92.8s)]
*  everything that led up to it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=97.4s)]
*  It's been very clear from the beginning that President Trump views this as a protracted, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=98.4s)]
*  stalemated conflict, and frankly, it's a proxy war between nuclear powers. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=102.0s)]
*  Ukraine and Russia. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=107.16s)]
*  And it needs to come to an end. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=109.0s)]
*  And no one has any idea or any plan to bring it to an end. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=110.2s)]
*  The plan of the Ukrainians up to now and their allies on Capitol Hill and the people you [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=112.92s)]
*  talk to in other countries is let's just keep giving them as much as they need for as long [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=118.0s)]
*  as it takes. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=121.64s)]
*  That's not a strategy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=122.64s)]
*  On the Russian side, obviously, they struggled early on in this conflict. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=123.64s)]
*  They're a bigger country. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=126.4s)]
*  They've made some progress, but by no means are the Russians running away with it either. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=127.4s)]
*  So it's a stalemated conflict. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  This was explained to everybody. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=133.2s)]
*  It was made very clear. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=134.23999999999998s)]
*  All the president's trying to do here is figure out is there's a path towards peace. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=136.23999999999998s)]
*  We have to engage both sides, the Russians and the Ukrainians, and we ask the Ukrainians [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=139.44s)]
*  not to sabotage it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=143.6s)]
*  When the vice president made the point that it's going to take diplomacy to get things [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=145.17999999999998s)]
*  like this solved, President Zelensky, unfortunately, made the decision to challenge the vice president [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=149.0s)]
*  and start questioning whether diplomacy is even possible. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=153.67999999999998s)]
*  In essence, sabotaging and undermining the president's plan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=156.6s)]
*  And so that led to the dust-up. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=160.0s)]
*  I'm glad to see that there's been a reconsideration of that position because I truly believe that [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=161.6s)]
*  this is a conflict that we need to find a way to end. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=166.04s)]
*  And it's going to require concessions from both sides. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=169.12s)]
*  But we have to get them both to the table. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=171.72s)]
*  The Ukrainians have to be there, obviously. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=173.96s)]
*  It's their country. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=175.76s)]
*  The Russians have to be at that table. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=176.76s)]
*  And only President Trump can make that possible. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=178.68s)]
*  That's been the goal. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  That remains the goal. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=182.04000000000002s)]
*  And that's what we're focused on now. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=185.04000000000002s)]
*  It's been a stalemate, but it's been a stalemate of hundreds of billions of hard-earned taxpayer [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  dollars. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  And it's not going to go on in perpetuity. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=191.44s)]
*  And it's — there won't be a country left. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=192.44s)]
*  And how many more people have to die? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=195.07999999999998s)]
*  How many people died from last Friday to today, for example? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=196.6s)]
*  So my understanding is Putin said he is willing to get into a negotiated settlement. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=200.2s)]
*  Is that your understanding? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=206.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=207.76s)]
*  Look, I mean, we met with him two weeks ago. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=208.76s)]
*  And the point of our meeting with him was very simple. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  Are you interested in talking about ending this war or not? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  Because there can't really be much of a change with our relationship as long as this war is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=217.1s)]
*  going on. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=220.88s)]
*  Their answer was, we are interested in talking about it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=221.88s)]
*  We now need to follow up. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=223.96s)]
*  It's hard to follow up when the other side of the conflict is saying they're not interested [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=225.52s)]
*  in peace at all. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=229.24s)]
*  And that was the message that was coming across. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=230.24s)]
*  Hopefully that's been corrected. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=232.36s)]
*  I hope that's going to be corrected more clearly. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=233.36s)]
*  And then I think that opens the door to figure out whether this is possible. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=235.84s)]
*  By the way, this should be a mystery to no one. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  The president, when he was a candidate and he was running, he said very clearly this [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  is a war that never would have happened. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=244.6s)]
*  And I believe that to be true. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  Had he been president — and we need to bring it to an end. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=247.64000000000001s)]
*  He's working to become — he wants to be a peacemaker. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=250.36s)]
*  Usually, and I made this point in multiple interviews, usually people are happy when [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=253.12s)]
*  our president, the president of the most powerful country in the world, is looking to prevent [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=257.52s)]
*  wars and to end wars. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=261.2s)]
*  Somehow when it's Donald Trump that's doing it, it's somehow a horrible thing. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=263.28s)]
*  So as I've said, it's important for us to understand we should be — we are blessed [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=266.64s)]
*  and fortunate to have a president that is looking to bring an end, if possible, to a [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=270.08s)]
*  conflict that's cost billions of dollars and hundreds of thousands of lives and destruction [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=273.96s)]
*  that will take a generation for Ukrainians and others to be able to recover from. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=278.48s)]
*  I watched you in a couple of interviews and it frustrates me. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=282.2s)]
*  Call him an evil dictator thug. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=285.68s)]
*  Nobody's disagreeing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=288.48s)]
*  But at this point, if you want to get a negotiated settlement, that was tried for four years [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=289.88s)]
*  by Joe Biden. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=296.0s)]
*  At this point, it's time to hit the reset button. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=297.04s)]
*  Would that deal be a mineral deal first that would ensure U.S. presence and also money [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=300.15999999999997s)]
*  for Ukraine to rebuild their country? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=305.08s)]
*  Would the second phase be a ceasefire? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=307.32s)]
*  Would the third phase be the negotiated settlement? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=310.08s)]
*  Does that sound about right to you? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=312.52s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to pre-negotiate it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=314.4s)]
*  Look, at the end of the day, the Ukrainians are going to have their demands, the Russians [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=317.2s)]
*  are going to have theirs. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=320.11999999999995s)]
*  We have to see how far apart they are if we get to that point in the process. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=321.11999999999995s)]
*  And that's where diplomacy — that's what the vice president's point was. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=324.35999999999996s)]
*  That's where diplomacy kicks in. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=327.35999999999996s)]
*  That's where the hard work of diplomacy becomes — comes into play when you have to figure [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=328.84s)]
*  out how do you bridge this difference. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=332.79999999999995s)]
*  But this is not unique to this crisis. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=334.23999999999995s)]
*  What we're going through right now with Hamas and Israel and Gaza, it's what's taken every [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=336.44s)]
*  war and every conflict that's ended in a truce, a ceasefire, whatever, has all — a peace [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=340.2s)]
*  plan has all been the result of hard — the hard work of diplomacy of bridging those differences. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=345.0s)]
*  But we have to begin that process. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=349.84s)]
*  And you can only do it if both sides are willing to do it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=351.2s)]
*  The Russians — look, they're not going to be easy to deal with either, right? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=353.67999999999995s)]
*  But we have to — we have to figure out what they're willing to do by getting them to the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  table. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=359.88s)]
*  We couldn't do that if the Ukrainians are saying that they're not interested. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=360.88s)]
*  Now that's changed. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=363.71999999999997s)]
*  Hopefully that's true. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=364.76000000000005s)]
*  And so I think the opening is now there to see what's possible. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=365.88000000000005s)]
*  And it would be in the benefit of everyone — the Russian people, the people of Ukraine, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  the people of the United States, frankly, our European partners and allies. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=373.04s)]
*  It would be to their benefit as well to see this come to an end. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=375.8s)]
*  But there's only one person on the planet that can make that happen. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=378.32000000000005s)]
*  And his name is Donald J. Trump, the president of the United States. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=381.20000000000005s)]
*  And we need to be — we should be cheering that on and we should be supporting that, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=383.96000000000004s)]
*  not undermining it or calling it names the way, you know, some are doing in the media [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=387.6s)]
*  and some are doing internationally. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=391.48s)]
*  I want to put up on the screen, truth social, earlier today. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=394.08000000000004s)]
*  President Trump, release all the hostages now, not later. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  Immediately return all the dead bodies of the people you murdered or it is over for you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=400.6s)]
*  Only sick and twisted people keep bodies and you are sick and twisted. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=405.68s)]
*  I am sending Israel everything it needs to finish the job. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=410.20000000000005s)]
*  Not a single Hamas member will be safe. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=413.96000000000004s)]
*  If you don't do as I say, I have just met with your former hostages. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=416.6s)]
*  By the way, I ran into them in D.C. as well. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=421.12s)]
*  The stories are harrowing. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=423.36s)]
*  Whose lives you have destroyed. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=425.24s)]
*  This is your last warning. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=427.24s)]
*  For the leadership, now is the time to leave Gaza while you still have a chance. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=429.64s)]
*  Also, the people of Gaza, a beautiful future awaits, but not if you hold hostages. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=433.84000000000003s)]
*  If you do, you are dead. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=439.16s)]
*  Make a smart decision. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  Release the hostages now or there will be hell to pay later. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=443.2s)]
*  Wow. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=447.32s)]
*  Now, I guess that's pretty clear. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=448.32s)]
*  I think both of us know President Trump well enough. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=450.96s)]
*  He means it. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=454.03999999999996s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=455.03999999999996s)]
*  Yep. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=456.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, hopefully they are going to do exactly what he just said. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=457.03999999999996s)]
*  You know how long we have been waiting for a long time in this country to have the kind [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=460.08s)]
*  of leadership with that kind of clarity. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=463.15999999999997s)]
*  People don't realize the president meets with these people. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=465.35999999999996s)]
*  He hears their stories. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=468.32s)]
*  He is outraged and rightfully so. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=469.56s)]
*  He is tired of watching these videos every weekend where hostages that are emaciated [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=471.35999999999996s)]
*  are released and bodies are turned over and sometimes it is the wrong bodies and this [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=475.4s)]
*  five here and three there and these games that are being played and he has lost his [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  patience with it. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=483.0s)]
*  He has been very clear about this from the beginning. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=484.0s)]
*  He has created space and time for this to be solved and now it is time for seeing it [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=485.52s)]
*  come to an end. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=489.04s)]
*  It is enough of this already. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=490.04s)]
*  These people have been in captivity now for over a year and a half. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=491.04s)]
*  These are monsters. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=494.24s)]
*  It needs to stop. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=495.24s)]
*  And, you know, I wish there were more international pressure along the same lines here, but I [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=496.24s)]
*  am glad he is putting those statements out. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=499.96000000000004s)]
*  I think he is, he doesn't say these things and not mean it as folks are finding out around [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=501.48s)]
*  the world. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=505.6s)]
*  If he says he is going to do something, he will do it. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=506.6s)]
*  He will do it. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=508.04s)]
*  So, they better take that seriously. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  You were in the chamber last night. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=512.84s)]
*  You saw the Democrats with the little temper tantrum. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=516.16s)]
*  What was your reaction to it all? [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=518.4s)]
*  Well, look, I think it is bizarre any time you are announcing that some young man has [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=521.04s)]
*  gotten into the U.S. Army Academy when you announce that a young boy who has survived [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=525.6s)]
*  brain cancer has been made a Secret Service deputy. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=530.76s)]
*  These are usually things that people, when the First Lady is announced, these are usually [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=534.52s)]
*  things that people stand up and clap for. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=537.52s)]
*  Whether you like the person who is speaking as president or not, to see that not happen [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=539.36s)]
*  last night was kind of shocking, to be honest with you. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=543.1999999999999s)]
*  It was really surprising and petty. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=545.0s)]
*  And I don't think it played well, but, you know, I am a diplomat now, but I can tell [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=547.68s)]
*  you this. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=552.0s)]
*  I didn't think it looked good on television. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=553.0s)]
*  And I have heard from a lot of people who didn't think it looked good either. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=554.0s)]
*  The president talked about ending a war yesterday, and instead the only cheers we heard from [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=557.12s)]
*  one side of the chamber was cheers for endless war and continuing to move forward. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=561.4s)]
*  These are bizarre things. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=566.24s)]
*  We live in bizarre times, but I am glad we have a president with moral clarity in Donald [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=568.2s)]
*  J. Trump. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=570.96s)]

*  Although I am not going to lie, I kind of like you as my senator in Florida. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=573.36s)]
*  I have got to be honest. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=577.5600000000001s)]
*  I have got to be straightforward. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  Well, you are in good hands. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=579.5600000000001s)]
*  You are still in good hands. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=580.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=581.5600000000001s)]
*  I know. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwD9Qa7X7Ns&t=582.5600000000001s)]
