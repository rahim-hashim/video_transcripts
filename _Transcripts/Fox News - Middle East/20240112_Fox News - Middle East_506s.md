# UK press reportedly leaked news of Houthi strikes early
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8)
*  Fox News alert the US and UK combining to use jets warships and submarines to strike at least 60 targets at 16 different [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=0.0s)]
*  Houthi military sites in Yemen this happened overnight [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=7.76s)]
*  They also had air defense systems weapon facilities and launch sites [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=10.76s)]
*  Jackie Heinrich is live from the White House with the very latest Jackie [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=15.0s)]
*  We still haven't seen or heard the president talk about this, but they have put out some paper statements [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=18.8s)]
*  That's right. We got a statement from the president last night guys [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  He said that this was a direct response to at least 27 Houthi attacks on commercial shipping that have affected [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=27.48s)]
*  50 nations with crews from more than 20 countries having been [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=34.24s)]
*  taken hostage or [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=38.52s)]
*  Threatened in acts of piracy, but the last straw was really earlier this week the 9th when the Houthis launched their most complex attack [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=40.52s)]
*  Directed at US ships to date [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=49.84s)]
*  Laughing off the final warning that the US and its allies issued just prior earlier this month [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=52.62s)]
*  Biden stead in a statement last night quote today's defensive action follows extensive diplomatic campaign and Houthi rebels escalating attacks against commercial vessels [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=58.94s)]
*  I will not hesitate to direct further measures to protect our people and free and the free flow of international commerce as necessary [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=67.94s)]
*  Now the US and UK coalition forces did strike more than 16 targets [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=75.94s)]
*  60 targets excuse me at 16 Houthi locations radar systems included defense systems as well missile storage and launch sites [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=80.89999999999999s)]
*  Australia Canada the Netherlands and Bahrain also lent support and the Houthis have claimed that five died and six were injured [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=88.3s)]
*  Republicans have welcomed this response including speaker Mike Johnson who tweeted this action by US and British forces is long overdue [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=95.94s)]
*  And we must hope these operations indicate a true shift in the Biden administration's approach to Iran and its proxies [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=102.74s)]
*  But Democrats like congressman Ro Khanna said the president needs to come to Congress before launching a strike against the Houthis in Yemen and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=108.9s)]
*  Involving us in another Middle East conflict that is article one of the Constitution [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=115.98s)]
*  I will stand up for that regardless of whether a Democrat or Republican is in the White House [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=120.1s)]
*  But remember this is the same Iranian backed militant group that the Biden administration removed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=124.94s)]
*  From the list of foreign terrorist organizations soon after he took office [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=131.18s)]
*  That was part of an effort to maintain a truce at the time. There was a civil war happening in Yemen [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=135.98s)]
*  Lloyd Austin did direct that or oversee this operation [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=143.78s)]
*  We're told from the hospital where he is still a patient at Walter Reed [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=147.34s)]
*  The president asked for options on Tuesday after the Houthis launched their biggest response to date was given some options by his national security team [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=151.66s)]
*  From what we can tell from the statements we've received so far Lloyd Austin monitored this as it was happening [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=160.18s)]
*  CENTCOM appears to have been sort of holding the reins there and the president signed off on it on Tuesday [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=166.1s)]
*  But interesting guys that there were some tweets ahead of time coming out of the UK [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=172.54000000000002s)]
*  That seemed to report this before it happened. That's very unusual [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  We don't ever see the US sort of announcing what it's going to do [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=181.02s)]
*  You hear a lot about not wanting to telegraph punches, but news of it slipped out from some UK reporting [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=185.22s)]
*  Jackie you said news slipped out before the attack or that we did attack before the attacks [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=192.16s)]
*  There were some reporters in London saying strikes to happen soon [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=198.28s)]
*  We're hearing about it and it's gonna be happening shortly and not too long later. It happened [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=203.8s)]
*  So we're still you know waiting to see any statements from the US in terms of the impact in terms of casualties, but [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=209.72s)]
*  That's unusual you don't hear the US ever and that's not what happened this time either we should know this came from UK reporters [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=217.16s)]
*  But that was a little bit out of the ordinary right? It was one of our coalition partners [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=226.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, there was some leakage. It's it's like that slogan from back in World War two loose lips sink ships [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=230.72s)]
*  Unfortunately, we knew about it early going back to something you were just talking about how a number of progressive [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=237.28s)]
*  Members of Congress are upset because the president it didn't go to Congress to ask for authorization [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=243.4s)]
*  Also, there are a handful of Republicans as well [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=250.36s)]
*  In something like this where they're going to engage the US military doesn't the White House or the Pentagon? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=254.04s)]
*  Don't they call at least the very tippy top leaders in Congress? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=259.64s)]
*  Well, you know, I couldn't tell you with any certainty because I'm obviously not one of the people in the room [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=265.2s)]
*  Whenever the the president takes any action, he always notifies Congress afterward in a statement citing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=271.42s)]
*  You know whatever authority it happened under [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=278.34s)]
*  There there may be in this scenario some authority that that he's citing that allowed that action to happen prior to notifications [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=282.18s)]
*  But also I haven't heard any criticism of this from those top leaders in Congress [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=291.26s)]
*  I know, you know Mike Johnson and Mitch McConnell would be on that list and they both issued statements yesterday saying that this was welcome [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=296.36s)]
*  I also saw some Armed Services Republicans who I believe would also be part of that notification [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=303.44s)]
*  Issuing statements of approval as well [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=311.04s)]
*  So without knowing the full detail on what communications came from where that I assume will come today because a lot of this happened overnight [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=312.84s)]
*  Or we'll get more detail on exactly who was told and when thank you very much [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=320.28s)]
*  That's quite a detail about the UK leaking so the Houthi rebels came out not only they not cowed they they promised unimaginable [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=325.84s)]
*  Revenge for the attacks and on some level according to some experts. They love this [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=333.52s)]
*  This is their great moment because they now engage with the great world power their archenemy [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=337.56s)]
*  They are not popular in the region Iran is not popular in the region [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=341.96s)]
*  The Houthi rebels really not popular in the region [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=345.84s)]
*  But when you attack US and when you attack Israel you gain popularity [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  And the question is how how good was our surveillance and intelligence? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=351.92s)]
*  I'll ask General Keene that in 12 minutes. How good was our intelligence and surveillance? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=356.52s)]
*  How clear were our shots and did we give them warning to clear out personnel like we did in Syria? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=360.24s)]
*  Just to send a message if you look at that [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=366.48s)]
*  Go ahead Lawrence if you look at that map right there that's Yemen and you think Houthi rebels [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=369.04s)]
*  You always think Yemen and you can see to the left the Red Sea [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=373.52s)]
*  Which is where these ships are the the orange or the reddish area that's occupied by the Houthis [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=376.42s)]
*  They control the country's northwest and the capital which is Sana. I guess that's how you pronounce it [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=381.84000000000003s)]
*  Their ideology is opposition to Israel and opposition to the US. Do you have that statement that you read earlier? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=387.12s)]
*  That's pretty scary while you find that Lawrence. Why are they attacking the ships in the Red Sea? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=392.78000000000003s)]
*  They said after the attack on October 7th in Israel [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=397.14s)]
*  The Houthis declared support for Hamas and said that they would target any ship traveling to or from Israel [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=400.0s)]
*  Because they're standing in solidarity with the Palestinian. Yeah, Ainsley you were talking about their slogan that they adopted in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=405.78000000000003s)]
*  2003 this is what the slogan is God is great death to the US death to Israel [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=412.62s)]
*  curse the Jews and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=419.06s)]
*  Victory for Islam so that just tells you where they stand on this to Brian's point earlier [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=420.94s)]
*  Did we give them notice? I think it's a valid point because you got 60 targets, right? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=427.3s)]
*  You had 16 locations, but you only had five people that were killed there [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=431.86s)]
*  So it would beg the question with all that effort there and you were only able to kill five people in it [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=436.02s)]
*  Did you give them some sort of notice and to one of my special ops friends and text me goes LJ? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=441.82s)]
*  You can poke the wassiness and you'll just get stung [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=448.06s)]
*  You got to destroy the entire nest if you want to be effective and I think that that that is the real question [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=450.92s)]
*  Does the Biden administration really just want to poke it or do they want to destroy? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  This cell of terrorism right? Well, I I understand from somebody [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=462.74s)]
*  Higher up that apparently a lot of these [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=467.54s)]
*  harassing events that they've been taking place on out on the Red Sea with the Houthis [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=471.1s)]
*  Involved drones and one of the primary a number of the primary [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=475.58s)]
*  Targets where they keep the drones where they launched the drones and stuff like that [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=479.46s)]
*  Why did Biden strip them of their terrorist organization status because he tried to kiss up to Iran in order to re-engage the [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=483.38s)]
*  Talks and also he wanted Saudi Arabia to be the enemy of his administration that blew up in his face with humiliation [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=489.58s)]
*  I'm Steve juicy [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4g0rBjwTnj8&t=495.21999999999997s)]
