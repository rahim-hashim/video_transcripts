# US rescue group describes ‘absolute mess’ on the ground in Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM)
*  Let's bring in Tim Kennedy, his resume Army Ranger, sniper, special forces operator and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=0.0s)]
*  co-founder of Save Our Allies. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=6.48s)]
*  Saved people in Afghanistan, saved people in Ukraine, and now he is there trying to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=8.88s)]
*  save some of the hostages. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  Tim, tell us the latest. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=15.08s)]
*  And it's been heartbreaking being here. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  We're in Ashkelon right now, which is just directly north of Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=20.48s)]
*  It is the most rocketed city in all of Israel, over a thousand rockets this week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=24.04s)]
*  These rockets that they're talking about impacting, you can hear drones overhead. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  We're in Egypt earlier this morning trying to figure out how they're going to be getting [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=33.12s)]
*  these people out of the rapid gates. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=36.32s)]
*  There's tons, tens of thousands of refugees that are going to be coming out of there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=37.8s)]
*  We have American hostages, American refugees. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=41.839999999999996s)]
*  It's just an absolute mess. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=45.16s)]
*  But one of the scariest things is the temperament around Israel by their neighbors. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Being in Egypt, it was incredibly difficult, one, to move through the border, and two, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=52.68s)]
*  obviously, being an American moving into Egypt related to an Israel crisis. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=57.56s)]
*  It's difficult here. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=63.2s)]
*  What do you mean it was difficult for you? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=65.04s)]
*  Did people give you a hard time? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=67.04s)]
*  Did they want to let you in or are they trying to intimidate you? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=68.12s)]
*  It's a hard question to answer. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=72.32000000000001s)]
*  We were in Beersheba yesterday talking to a police unit. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=74.28s)]
*  They had to respond to this area and all along the east side of Gaza. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=78.04s)]
*  They lost one quarter of everyone that is in their department, was injured, is missing [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=83.52s)]
*  still or was killed in the fighting. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=89.12s)]
*  You can see just the despair and brokenness inside of them and the things that they saw [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=92.36s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=96.24s)]
*  And the difficulty then, like the logistics, us being able to move and figure out to fill [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=97.24s)]
*  the gaps in between all of the aid that's coming in and where are we best used and how [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=103.6s)]
*  are we needed here. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=109.16s)]
*  Difficult is the only word to describe the emotional damage, to see the pain in these [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=111.0s)]
*  people's eyes knowing that these women, these children were so horrifically killed and tortured. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=116.52s)]
*  It's difficult. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=123.2s)]
*  Tim, you guys were on the ground before the administration was on the ground to evacuate [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=125.2s)]
*  the Americans that are there. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=131.04s)]
*  How many Americans are we talking about you've got to evacuate? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=132.48s)]
*  The days immediately following the terrorist attack by Hamas, we were flying people out [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=139.44s)]
*  of private planes, the way a Haifa. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=144.16s)]
*  Department of State to their credit, they got here quick. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=147.4s)]
*  And once they got here, they're running constant flights. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=150.2s)]
*  And again, remembering the men and women that do the work. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=153.76s)]
*  Mr. Rogers said, always look to the people doing the work, doing the people that are [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=159.4s)]
*  trying to help. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=162.36s)]
*  And the people that were here from the American government, from the Department of State, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=163.56s)]
*  they were doing really amazing stuff. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=166.76s)]
*  The first few days, though, it was really, really hard. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  There were people that were hiding in bunkers. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=170.88s)]
*  There were people that were too scared to leave the positions that they were at after [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=172.83999999999997s)]
*  seeing the videos that were coming out. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  So we had to physically go and find those people and then escort those people from [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  where they were to where they could be flown out. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=181.92s)]
*  And in some cases, that was like flying on a one propeller airplane from Haifa to Cyprus. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=184.2s)]
*  It's been hard. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  There are satellite photos. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  We want to share them with the audience of the tanks gathering in Gaza, like the northern [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=196.84s)]
*  part of Gaza to go in. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=202.52s)]
*  They don't mind giving away their positions. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=205.36s)]
*  They know how they're going to do it. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=206.84s)]
*  I guess the word is first, you get the bulldozers, then you get the tanks, then you get the troops. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=208.36s)]
*  Would you subscribe to that theory? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=215.4s)]
*  Yeah, but as you know, when you're fighting an insurgency, there's going to be bio traps. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=217.4s)]
*  They're going to be hiding behind hostages. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  They're going to be hiding behind civilians. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  They're going to break. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=227.23999999999998s)]
*  You can still hear that drone. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=228.23999999999998s)]
*  We're just north of Gaza. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=229.23999999999998s)]
*  They do every single war crime that we're not allowed to do. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=232.0s)]
*  That is what Hamas does. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=235.32s)]
*  They are absolute pure evil. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=236.32s)]
*  And they have for too long had control over Palestine. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=238.84s)]
*  And Gaza's control as these poor, incredible soldiers, these brave men and women, they're [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  about to go into Gaza. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=248.16s)]
*  Every single inch they're going to have to fight for in the most barbaric ways possible [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=249.76s)]
*  because those people, Hamas, those evil demons are going to be fighting at every single corner [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=254.0s)]
*  to try to do the most evil type of warfare you can imagine. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=259.32s)]
*  So, Tom, what are the chances of us getting these Americans? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=262.68s)]
*  There are 11 that are unaccounted for. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=266.12s)]
*  There are 203 hostages. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=267.76s)]
*  That includes the Israelis too. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=269.6s)]
*  What are our chances of going in and saving them in all of your experience? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=271.36s)]
*  You want the Jessica Buchanan instance where, you know, skill team six halos in under the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=276.96s)]
*  darkness of night and they go kill all the terrorists and the West rescue the American. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=282.24s)]
*  That is not going to be the case here. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=287.0s)]
*  In expectation management, I don't want to be cruel. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  I know families are watching. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=291.24s)]
*  This is a dire situation for those hostages. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=292.8s)]
*  The things that they have to experience in the past nine days because of the brutality. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=295.4s)]
*  I mean, I'm talking mala and say absolute evil carnage. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=300.2s)]
*  That's what these people are. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=304.44s)]
*  The things that they did to the victims that they murdered here are indescribable. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=305.44s)]
*  It's unconscionable things that they did. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=308.96s)]
*  That's what the IDF is going to have to fight through to find these hostages and make no [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=311.96s)]
*  mistake Hamas will kill these people in an instant. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=317.0s)]
*  They will hide behind them. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  They'll throw grenades behind them. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  They'll be shooting from behind them. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=322.59999999999997s)]
*  They will be using hostages and civilians. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  They launched the rocket attacks from hospitals. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=326.52s)]
*  They launched rocket attacks from civilian locations in hope that the idea for respond [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=329.2s)]
*  and more civilians be damaged. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  That is what Hamas does. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=336.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, Tim, the U.S. military, especially special forces have been training with the [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=337.47999999999996s)]
*  Israelis for a long time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=341.4s)]
*  But you guys specialize in HR, hostage rescue. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=344.52s)]
*  Do you think there's going to come a point, especially when we're talking about American [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=348.24s)]
*  hostages, that they're going to need the help of the American military to get this done, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=351.44s)]
*  to get those hostages? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=357.48s)]
*  The motto of Saber Allies is Here I Am Send Me. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=360.48s)]
*  They heard the voice of the Lord say, Here I Am Send Me. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=364.64s)]
*  They responded, Here I Am Send Me. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=366.6s)]
*  I promise you every single American soldier will raise their heart and heart beat to come [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=368.24s)]
*  fight street by street, just like we did in Ramadi to try and save those Americans. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=373.32s)]
*  There's nobody in the world better than it. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=379.8s)]
*  Our special missions units within the United States, they are the most incredible war fighters. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=381.28000000000003s)]
*  And this is going to be the hardest war that I think IDF has ever seen. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=386.36s)]
*  So let me factor in something else. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=389.72s)]
*  It turns out Hamas does have a spokesperson, and they're located in Hezbollah, not Hezbollah, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=391.56s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=397.14s)]
*  Osama Hamdan says this. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=398.14s)]
*  They don't know how many hostages they have, and they say Islamic Jihad has some of them. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=401.18s)]
*  They have at least 30. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=406.46s)]
*  They also say there'll be a separate request for citizens of other countries for the Israelis, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=408.09999999999997s)]
*  military and regular. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=414.9s)]
*  They're looking to exchange some of the 1,100 prisoners the Israelis have. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=416.5s)]
*  Having said all these moving parts, where do you start in trying to get them back alive? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=421.02s)]
*  Man, I don't know. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=426.3s)]
*  There's an amazing book called The New Rules of War, and it talks about how difficult this [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=428.66s)]
*  new type of war is that we're fighting. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=432.98s)]
*  We're fighting non-state actors that are proxies for Iran, just like we're experiencing here. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=434.54s)]
*  And let's point out, first of all, that coward that is hiding, not in the war zone, he's [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=439.18s)]
*  not there with his guys on the ground fighting for his promised land. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=443.3s)]
*  Hamas does not care about any of the Palestinians. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=447.26s)]
*  They never have. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=450.26s)]
*  They are rich. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=451.26s)]
*  They're just like the oligarchs. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=452.26s)]
*  And he, of course, is in a different place, probably living in Hezbollah. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=453.26s)]
*  Hey, Tim. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=456.42s)]
*  Oh, sorry. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=457.42s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=458.42s)]
*  Well, you know what? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=459.42s)]
*  To that, the trying to negotiate, this is what Jordan did. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=461.42s)]
*  The president of Jordan, when they captured one of their pilots and they burnt that guy [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=466.26s)]
*  alive, the president of Jordan went and got every single ISIS member that he had, and [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=470.26s)]
*  he hung every single one of them. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=474.3s)]
*  You cannot try to treat these people with kindness because they will just continue to [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=476.38s)]
*  exact revenge because they do it from an evil position. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=480.06s)]
*  They do not recognize any form of trade. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=483.06s)]
*  All they want to do is win and hurt people. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=485.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=487.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=488.38s)]
*  You know, Tim, the White House tweeted out this picture of Biden meeting with U.S. special [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=489.38s)]
*  forces as special forces yourself. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=492.1s)]
*  Their faces weren't blurred out. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=494.54s)]
*  What does that mean for them? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=495.82s)]
*  Will they be able to work again? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=496.82s)]
*  And how dangerous did that? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=498.32s)]
*  How much danger did that put their families in or themselves in? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=500.16s)]
*  First, everybody that works within the government is human. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=503.62s)]
*  We are fallible, all of us. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=508.46s)]
*  The men and women that are here on the ground are the most, I think, incredible men and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=511.18s)]
*  women that I've ever had the opportunity to work with. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=514.08s)]
*  But we're still human. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=516.14s)]
*  We try our hardest. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=517.66s)]
*  That is a devastating mistake. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=519.46s)]
*  Our identities, while you're working especially as an operator undercover, you have to keep [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=521.26s)]
*  who you are protected and hidden. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=529.54s)]
*  Those men are in jeopardy. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=533.3s)]
*  Just like Hamas and Hezbollah and ISIS-K, you know, Karana al-Gaida, all branches are [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=534.8s)]
*  looking for opportunities to take a face, get a name, figure out who their families [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=540.24s)]
*  are and then start attacking those people. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=545.3s)]
*  And Israel has been experiencing this for decades. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=548.12s)]
*  And I hope we don't see that in the United States. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=551.52s)]
*  45 years. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=553.56s)]
*  That is exactly where it starts. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=554.56s)]
*  Tim, 45 years that this has never happened to Delta Force. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=555.56s)]
*  And now it happens now. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=559.76s)]
*  They're the most elite fighting force on the planet. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=563.08s)]
*  Their op-sec is second to none. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=566.84s)]
*  Their professionalism, their experience, their capability, truly the most, I mean, if you [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=568.36s)]
*  walk next to those men and you're walking next to giants, and it's heartbreaking that [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=572.6s)]
*  men that have dedicated so much of their lives to this idea of service and being part of [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=578.5200000000001s)]
*  their country and being part of the Department of Defense and being part of the most elite [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=584.24s)]
*  special operations unit in the planet, no more so than that in the history of mankind. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=588.2s)]
*  That's who these men are. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=593.88s)]
*  And now they are vulnerable because of mistakes. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=595.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=597.72s)]
*  I've got to bring up something you just said. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=598.72s)]
*  When they burned that pilot alive in a cage and Jordan came around and hung every ISIS [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=600.32s)]
*  prisoner they had, that builds on the guy I talked to yesterday whose dad co-founded [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=605.5200000000001s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=610.76s)]
*  And he said, Israel can't worry about the PR. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=611.76s)]
*  They'll explain it later. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=614.72s)]
*  The people you're going up against are going to be the most brutal people ever. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=616.36s)]
*  And it's going to take that type of mentality. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=621.5600000000001s)]
*  You can't win a PR war and beat them. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=624.1s)]
*  That's what it's going to take to be successful. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=628.2s)]
*  He also said you don't want to go in those tunnels. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=630.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure if this is against the rules of war. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=632.72s)]
*  He goes, just put in poison gas and kill them all because if you go down there, they're [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=634.6800000000001s)]
*  prepared to die with, you know, they're prepared to kill you. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=639.48s)]
*  And it's going to be hard for you to get out. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=642.7600000000001s)]
*  Do we get used to fighting to be successful? [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=644.94s)]
*  Do we have to get as brutal as they are? [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=648.94s)]
*  Or are we going to continue to have to fight the PR, lose the PR and lose the battles? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=652.34s)]
*  We are a just nation. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=659.46s)]
*  We're a nation of laws and we're a nation that does the most remarkable things. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=660.46s)]
*  We climb cliffs, we storm beaches, we hear that Jews are being killed during the Holocaust. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=665.12s)]
*  I got you, man. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=669.3000000000001s)]
*  We're going to go and we're going to kill every single person that stands in our way [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=670.3000000000001s)]
*  until we get there and we free them. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=672.5400000000001s)]
*  Do I ever want to fight the way that they fight? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=675.3s)]
*  No. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=677.0600000000001s)]
*  Do we have the appetite to do what it takes to win a war right now? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=678.0600000000001s)]
*  We do not. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=681.02s)]
*  The American people since Vietnam have not been able to understand what really happens [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=682.02s)]
*  in war. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=686.1s)]
*  And what happens in war is the worst thing that one set of humans could do to another [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=687.1s)]
*  set of humans. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=690.98s)]
*  When you're fighting a group like Hamas, they are just pure evil and it is unconscionable [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=691.98s)]
*  the things that they will do to win. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=696.46s)]
*  Not that we need to do those things, but he's 100% right. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=699.38s)]
*  If you are worrying about the propaganda or the public relations fallout from you having [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=702.94s)]
*  to go and fight in a war to win a war, you are destined to lose that war. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=707.74s)]
*  You have to go and fight the fight to win that fight with no other thing on your mind. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=712.08s)]
*  If I'm going to be running towards gunfire, I'm not going to be thinking about the camera. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=716.58s)]

*  I have to go win that fight. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=723.58s)]
*  And that's what they have to do right now is they have to fight inch by inch to win [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=724.7800000000001s)]
*  and nothing else but to destroy the enemy that is trying to destroy them. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=728.5400000000001s)]

*  That is a call for genocide. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=737.12s)]

*  in Israel. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5R6An-DfRbM&t=743.04s)]
