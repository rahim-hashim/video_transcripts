# Why Israel is ‘afraid’ over the slow release of hostages
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y)
*  and breaking just moments ago, reporters asking President Biden about a ceasefire and whether [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=0.0s)]
*  or not that would happen in Israel or in Gaza, saying that we should. He said that we should [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=6.16s)]
*  have the hostages released before taking up those talks. We're going to work on that. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  We'll turn that sound bite around for you in moments. But first, let's go live to Jerusalem [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=15.68s)]
*  with our Fox News at night anchor, Trace Gallagher, reporting live from there. Hi, Trace. What [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  can you tell us from Jerusalem right now? Well, we know, Martha, that this has been in the works [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=25.8s)]
*  for a while. You reported at the top of the show that you had two hostages, two elderly women who [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  were released 179, 184 or 85. We can tell you that they have now crossed the Rafa crossing into [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=34.92s)]
*  Egypt will make their way back to Israel. But but there was talk all day of releasing some 50 [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  hostages and Carter was involved in this and they would be dual citizens. And of course, those two [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=47.28s)]
*  hostages that were released at the top of the hour, Israel wanted that not to happen because [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=53.36s)]
*  they're afraid of this whole process of dribs and drabs, releasing two here and four there. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=58.64s)]
*  And so now the president is asked, should there be a ceasefire? And he says there should be a [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=64.24s)]
*  ceasefire until all the hostages are released. You're going to play the sound in a minute. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=70.56s)]
*  What's fascinating about this is that Hamas knows that they've got valuable people. And if this [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  ground invasion happens, the lives of those hostages, Martha, you know, it's unclear what [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=82.24s)]
*  happens to them. Then you talk to the IDF forces and as much good intelligence as they have, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=87.44s)]
*  they still cannot go in and locate exactly where these hostages are. Many IDF people tell us they [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=93.52s)]
*  are probably being moved. So trying to get the intel to to identify where they are is going to [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=99.84s)]
*  be tough. And this is a great tactic for Carter and Hamas to be able to slow down this ground [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=105.76s)]
*  invasion. And there's a lot of political pressure to do so. Israel says it's going to happen, but [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=112.48s)]
*  right now they don't seem to be on a fast footing to have it happen anytime soon. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, a hundred percent, Trace. And, you know, obviously we know that they brutally slaughtered [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  of 1400 people. So there was a reason that they kept these individuals. They understand [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=130.0s)]
*  the importance of these individuals and that countries like the United States and Israel [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=137.04000000000002s)]
*  involved in all of this care about life and care about these individuals. And they will use that [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=142.16000000000003s)]
*  to the greatest extent possible. And we have been there before with this situation, which we're [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=148.32000000000002s)]
*  going to talk about with John Kirby in a moment, but I want to play the moment that you just [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=153.36s)]
*  mentioned because we've turned it around. President Biden was speaking about the economy, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=156.4s)]
*  about Biden, Bidenomics and things along those lines. He was shouted a question about this, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=160.48000000000002s)]
*  the ceasefire and the hostages. Little difficult to hear, but let's play it so you can take a look. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=166.32s)]
*  So he said we should have a ceasefire. We should have those hostages released [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=177.6s)]
*  and then we can talk about it, Trace. That's what we just got from the president. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=181.76s)]
*  And I think he said, he walked in there, he said we should have a ceasefire. No, no, not a ceasefire. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=187.12s)]
*  We should have the hostages released and then talk about a ceasefire, but you can't have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=190.96s)]
*  the hostages released while there's fighting going on. I mean, that's probably not going to happen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=196.24s)]
*  So, so the whole thing here is yes, the administration is working on a ceasefire. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=201.12s)]
*  They want this to stop until all the hostages are released, which is why Israel does not want them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=206.08s)]
*  released in twos. This could go on for months and months, but on the flip side, Martha, keep in mind [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=211.84s)]
*  that because this ground invasion has not started yet, it also is somewhat beneficial to these [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=217.92000000000002s)]
*  troops, these Israeli troops, because you're talking about urban warfare. I mean, the last [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=224.24s)]
*  time we really saw it was in Mosul and this is a very bloody ugly thing when it, when it goes on. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=228.24s)]
*  And the IDF, the Israeli forces want to make sure that they have everything in order before they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=235.12s)]
*  step foot across that border. It's been several years since the IDF has fought on the ground [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=241.36s)]
*  in Gaza City and I believe the Israelis lost, I believe, 13 soldiers. I think I'm right on that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=246.56s)]
*  number back then. So obviously a lot of concern and, and you know, those who are in a big rush [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  for this to get underway, obviously there's good reason for some of the caution that we're seeing [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=258.0s)]
*  around all of this is for those families, wait for those hostages to come home. Trace, good to see you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=263.36s)]
*  there. We look forward to your coverage. Thank you very much and we look forward to joining us [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mqqu_0jTv6Y&t=268.24s)]
