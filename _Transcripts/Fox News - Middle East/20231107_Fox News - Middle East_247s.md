# Kirby: US, Israel are 'friends' but friends don't always have to agree
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c)
*  John, on the proxy attacks on U.S. troops, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=0.0s)]
*  it were now up to 40 since October 17th, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=8.68s)]
*  with 46 service members being injured [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=13.16s)]
*  or reporting traumatic brain injuries. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  Does the President think that the action [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=19.18s)]
*  that was taken a couple weeks ago [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=22.28s)]
*  to push back on this was enough? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=24.8s)]
*  The President felt like those were two legitimate targets [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=27.2s)]
*  directly tied to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=30.96s)]
*  that supports these militia groups, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=34.76s)]
*  and they were ammo weapons facilities, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=38.08s)]
*  certainly legitimate targets that we believe [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=41.16s)]
*  not only had a practical effect [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=45.239999999999995s)]
*  on limiting some of their capability, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=47.56s)]
*  but sent a strong signal of how seriously [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=50.0s)]
*  we're going to look after our troops and facilities. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=51.64s)]
*  If and when we decide to respond again in the future, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=54.36s)]
*  we'll do it at a time and in a manner of our choosing. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=59.24s)]
*  We will absolutely take the action that we need to take. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=61.68s)]
*  The President, as Commander-in-Chief, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=64.68s)]
*  will order that action to protect our troops [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=66.0s)]
*  and facilities as he sees fit. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=68.32s)]
*  Has there been any additional warning from the President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=70.52s)]
*  since the last time we responded that this needs to stop? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=74.48s)]
*  Because clearly the attacks on our troops didn't stop. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=78.4s)]
*  I will not get into the decision-making process [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=81.72s)]
*  or options before the Commander-in-Chief. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=84.32s)]
*  I would just tell you that we will continue [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=86.84s)]
*  to take the action we believe is appropriate [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=88.28s)]
*  to protect our troops and our facilities. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  And then on the apparent disagreement [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=91.96s)]
*  between the U.S. and its ally, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=94.72s)]
*  to some of the other questions that you've already gotten, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=96.84s)]
*  it is notable that we're seeing the U.S. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=100.12s)]
*  more readily acknowledge some space [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=103.36s)]
*  between what we're advising and what Israel is doing. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=105.68s)]
*  Like, Israel appears to be resisting [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=111.2s)]
*  the humanitarian causes still. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=113.64s)]
*  The President and the administration [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=115.76s)]
*  have been calling that for a couple of weeks, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=117.12s)]
*  saying that we don't support indefinite occupation. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=119.68s)]
*  That was the State Department briefing today [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=122.52s)]
*  after Netanyahu said that Israeli forces [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=124.72s)]
*  could be there for an indefinite period of time. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=127.76s)]
*  And even in the readout from the call with the Prime Minister, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=129.68s)]
*  the White House readout, you know, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=133.08s)]
*  used again the language of the extremist settlers. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=135.52s)]
*  This is somewhat notably different [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=139.04s)]
*  than the kinds of language we were hearing [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=141.64s)]
*  immediately after October 7th. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  So, can you characterize the closeness [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  of the relationship right now? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=148.2s)]
*  It's extremely close. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=150.2s)]
*  And we're, as was transmitted by the President [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=151.6s)]
*  in the call with Prime Minister Netanyahu yesterday, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=159.28s)]
*  we remain solidly behind Israel [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=161.28s)]
*  as they continue to try to eliminate this threat [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=163.84s)]
*  to their people and to their sovereignty. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=165.95999999999998s)]
*  And they're going to continue to get security assistance [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=167.51999999999998s)]
*  from the United States. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  There's no daylight there whatsoever. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=170.2s)]
*  Now, we're friends. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=171.67999999999998s)]
*  And friends don't have to agree on every single nuance [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  and every single word. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=176.28s)]
*  The Prime Minister speaks for a sovereign nation [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  and for a sovereign people. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  And he should obviously, you know, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=182.95999999999998s)]
*  be queried about the points that he's making. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=185.95999999999998s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that we're somehow backing away [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=188.67999999999998s)]
*  from our friend and our ally, Israel, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  the strongest ally we have in the Middle East, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=192.6s)]
*  or we're backing off our support for what they're trying to do [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  to protect their people. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=196.96s)]
*  Netanyahu in particular, given the political reporting [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=197.96s)]
*  from a little while ago, that was pointed to special [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  whether he'd be involved. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=202.96s)]
*  I'm not going to get into confirming that kind of, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=203.96s)]
*  those kind of press reports. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=207.92000000000002s)]
*  I would just tell you, these are two men [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=209.44s)]
*  that have known each other a long time. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=210.8s)]
*  And I don't think it's any shock to anybody [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=212.84s)]
*  that on a political spectrum, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=214.96s)]
*  they're not exactly always in the same place on every issue. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=216.32s)]
*  But one thing they do agree on is that Israel has a right [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=218.88s)]
*  to exist as a country. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=221.72s)]
*  And they have a right and a responsibility [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=223.48000000000002s)]
*  to defend that country and their citizens against that threat, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=225.4s)]
*  the threat that was posed to them like on October 7th. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=228.6s)]
*  And in the United States, they will continue to find [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=231.08s)]
*  a true friend that will continue to support [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=233.8s)]
*  their ability to do that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=235.56s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkfP5399k4c&t=237.08s)]
