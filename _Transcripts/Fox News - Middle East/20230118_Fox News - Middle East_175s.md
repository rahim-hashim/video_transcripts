# Enes Kanter Freedom: I was 'speechless' that this could happen to me
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4)
*  So the former NBA player Enes Cantor-Freedom was in Rome recently when he learned from the FBI that he needed to come back to the US [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=0.0s)]
*  Immediately. He was told that the Turkish government had put a bounty on his head [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=6.96s)]
*  Freedom grew up in Turkey before coming to the United States and changing his name in honor of this country [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  He's been critical of the Turkish government and Enes Cantor-Freedom joins us tonight [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=16.88s)]
*  Thanks so much for coming on so the Turkish government you were informed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=21.36s)]
*  But the US government has put a bounty on your head half a million dollar bounty. What does that mean a bounty on your head? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=25.62s)]
*  So like first of all, thank you for having me mr. Carlson [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=33.14s)]
*  I was doing a basketball camp in Vatican actually for you know [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=36.74s)]
*  Christians Catholic Muslim and Jewish kids and I heard the news for the first time and I had a I got in touch with FBI [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=41.74s)]
*  Immediately and they said come back to America at this moment [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=48.7s)]
*  So I took a flight the next day and so [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=52.34s)]
*  You know [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=56.1s)]
*  This is the first time actually Turkish government put on a bounty on my head and put him in a most wanted terrorist list [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=57.02s)]
*  just because if I talk about the some of the human rights violations and political prisoners happen in Turkey and [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=62.78s)]
*  You know, I'm not the only one there are so many journalists academics professors and celebrities are on that list [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=69.30000000000001s)]
*  And when I had a conversation with my friends on the ground [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=75.0s)]
*  They said the mafia the serial killers actually [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=78.22s)]
*  Professional hitmen's and cartel could be after my case and I was like speechless [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=82.42s)]
*  I was like this is this cannot be happening to an American citizen in US soil [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=87.14s)]
*  Do you feel like the US government is helping to protect you from this threat from a foreign government? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=92.62s)]
*  Really good question, you know [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=100.98s)]
*  Some of the members of the Congress actually react into these news and ask in Biden administration to speak come and actually take some actions [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=102.3s)]
*  You know because I remember first time President Biden before he took to office [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=110.16s)]
*  Actually, the first thing he said the the the problem in Middle East is our door and we need to do something about it [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=115.14s)]
*  And it's been almost two years and he has not done a thing yet [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=122.1s)]
*  so we have to [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=125.53999999999999s)]
*  Irritate human rights and because Turkey plays a very important role because it could have be the bridge of Islam and West but just [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=126.54s)]
*  Because of there is no freedom of speech, you know [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=133.58s)]
*  There are so many political prisoners and innocent people are in the jail waiting for help. It is not possible [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=136.74s)]
*  so I'm asking please by the administration to take some solid actions and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=142.46s)]
*  And help my friends over there help my family over there. I haven't seen them almost ten years [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=148.38s)]
*  Well, if they're okay with Chinese genocide I doubt they're gonna be too upset about Erdogan, but that's just a guess hope I'm wrong [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=153.42000000000002s)]
*  He just can't afraid great to see you tonight. Thank you [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcKieSCWLY4&t=159.22s)]
