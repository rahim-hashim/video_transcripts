# Lindsey Graham: This is 'political white-washing' by the Biden administration
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU)
*  Joining me now, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. Welcome back to Fox News Sunday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  OK, we'll get to Afghanistan, but I want to start with China. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=6.4s)]
*  And you heard Aisha's reporting there about what Reuters has been calling a standoff in the Taiwan [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=9.28s)]
*  Strait. You served in the Air Force. We noted weeks ago an Air Force general of four stars said [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=13.92s)]
*  that he thought we would be in actual combat with China by 2025. Chairman McCaul has said the same [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=18.8s)]
*  thing on the show. Where do you think we are this morning? Where does this go? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=23.68s)]
*  Well, number one, we're celebrating Easter. So if you're looking for some good news, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=27.36s)]
*  it's Easter Sunday to Taiwan. Here's what I think. I think they're setting the stage possibly for a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=32.8s)]
*  blockade of Taiwan, that the Communist Chinese Party is going to test us dramatically this year [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=40.08s)]
*  and next year before the election. So in 1961, the Russians tried to isolate West Berlin. So I'm [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=47.04s)]
*  fearful that the Chinese may be setting conditions to blockade Taiwan in the coming months or weeks. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=56.32s)]
*  And we need to respond forcefully. If they do that, we need to blockade oil shipments coming [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=64.32s)]
*  from the Mideast to China and let them know if you blockade Taiwan, we're going to cut off your oil. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=70.08s)]
*  We need to train more aggressively Taiwanese forces so they can fight like the Ukrainians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=77.6s)]
*  We need to put nuclear-tipped missiles back in our submarines. Biden won't do it. The military has [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=83.04s)]
*  asked for nuclear-tipped cruise missiles to be put back in submarines like the Russians did. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  We need more forces in the region. I think if you do those things, you could deter a blockade. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=94.72s)]
*  It sounds, though, like a ratcheting up of the situation. And if Taiwan is not fully equipped, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  trained, armed, ready for this, we don't want to be leading to World War III. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Well, nobody wants World War III, but what kind of world do you want to live in? Do you want to [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=109.84s)]
*  live in a world where an island called Taiwan could be taken by China? 90 percent of the high-end [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=115.04s)]
*  ships are made in Taiwan. They'd have a monopoly on the digital economy. Do you just want to let [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  Putin take whatever he wants in Europe? I don't want to live in that kind of world. There's no [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=126.16s)]
*  reason for this. Listen, I believe in a one-China policy, but I would be willing to fight for Taiwan [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=130.32s)]
*  because Taiwan is a democracy. We've stood with them for decades. So Taiwan's not the problem. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=136.0s)]
*  Lindsey Graham's not the problem. It's Putin and it's Xi. So what would I do to deter a blockade? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=141.28s)]
*  I'd let the Chinese know, if you blockade Taiwan, you're going to have a hard time getting oil from [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=146.48s)]
*  the Mideast. I would increase training and give the F-16s they need in Taiwan. There's a backlog. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=150.96s)]
*  I would solve that backlog. I would move more forces to South Korea and Japan. I would put [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=157.12s)]
*  nuclear-tipped cruise missiles in all of our submarines all over the world, like the Russians [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=162.8s)]
*  did when they got out of the nuclear treaty and started using cruise missiles, nuclear-tipped. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=167.36s)]
*  That's what Reagan did in the Cold War. So I would up our game. And if you don't up your game now, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=172.8s)]
*  you are going to have a war. Okay, very quickly, because I want to get to a lot of other topics. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=178.0s)]
*  Chairman McCaul discussed with Aisha Hasni there about the possibility of authorizing force and [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  the possibility of sending U.S. troops to Taiwan. Would you support that scenario? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  Strategic ambiguity is not working. China, after Afghanistan, believes that the store is open, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=193.52s)]
*  that you can go in and take whatever you want on Biden's watch. So the question for the Congress, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=199.84s)]
*  should we have a defense agreement with the island of Taiwan? We don't. Should we have one? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=205.12s)]
*  But yes, I'd be very much open to using U.S. forces to defend Taiwan, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=210.16000000000003s)]
*  because it's in our national security interest to do so. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=214.96s)]
*  Okay. China, also an actor with regard to fentanyl, Mexico, the border. You've been [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=217.68s)]
*  very vocal on that. Mexico's president has sent a letter to China, please help us out with the [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=222.16s)]
*  fentanyl. They've said basically there's no such thing as illegal trafficking of fentanyl between [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=226.24s)]
*  Mexico and China. You have talked about getting tough there, about using the U.S. military along [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=230.4s)]
*  the border with the cartels. Mexico's president, this is how AP reports his response to you. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=235.68s)]
*  Lopez Obrador said Mexico would not accept such threats, calling them, quote, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=240.96s)]
*  an insult to Mexico and a lack of respect for independence and sovereignty. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=244.88s)]
*  Lopez threatened to start a campaign in the U.S. asking Mexicans and Hispanics who live there [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=249.92000000000002s)]
*  to not vote for Republicans. So what are you proposing, keeping in mind they're a sovereign [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=254.88s)]
*  country? Well, here's what I'm proposing, that no sovereign country has the right to kill 70,000 [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  Americans without some kind of repercussion. 70,000 Americans died last year from fentanyl poisoning. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=268.08s)]
*  This year alone, 13,000 pounds of fentanyl has been seized at the U.S.-Mexican border, okay? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=275.6s)]
*  That's enough to kill billions of people, two and a half billion people. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=282.72s)]
*  My point is I want to work with Mexico, but the president of Mexico denies that the drug cartels [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=287.28000000000003s)]
*  are in charge of part of his country. He's delusional about what's going on in his backyard. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=293.6s)]
*  Writing a letter to the Chinese president means nothing. So what I want to do, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=298.56s)]
*  I want to designate drug cartels in Mexico as foreign terrorist organizations who are sending [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=302.64s)]
*  in fentanyl to poison Americans by the tens of thousands and put military force on the table to [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=308.08s)]
*  eradicate those drug cartels if Mexico does not work with us. I want to work with the president [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=314.24s)]
*  of Mexico, but he's in denial about the problem and I'm not going to sit on the sideline and watch [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=319.68s)]
*  Mexico be used as a staging area to ship fentanyl into the United States that kills 70,000 Americans [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=325.12s)]
*  last year. What Mexico's doing is insufficient and China needs to be put on notice too. FTO designation [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=332.88s)]
*  of drug cartels in Mexico will allow us to prosecute the chemical manufacturers in China [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=339.92s)]
*  that supply the product to Mexico. Okay, but to be clear, U.S. military assets this side of the [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=345.36s)]
*  border, correct? Not in Mexico. Right. Okay, let's move on to Afghanistan. Yeah, okay, that's clear. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=350.40000000000003s)]
*  I want to ask you about Afghanistan. You served in uniform there. You know the situation there. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=357.36s)]
*  We got the report this week. You saw Alex's reporting. She cited this portion that says [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=361.76s)]
*  President Biden's choices for how to execute a withdrawal from Afghanistan were severely [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=366.32s)]
*  constrained by conditions created by his predecessor. They say that President Trump had [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=369.92s)]
*  drawn down too many troops, that the special immigrant visa program to get people out of there [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=374.0s)]
*  had been starved of resources, that the Taliban had been emboldened by us engaging in peace talks [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=378.56s)]
*  without including our allies or the Afghan government. They talk about the Doha agreement, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=383.28s)]
*  the release of 5,000 Taliban fighters from prison. Is it fair to say that any of those [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=387.2s)]
*  things handcuffed the Biden administration's ability to make a smooth withdrawal? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=392.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, some of the things President Trump did I disagreed with, but he didn't withdraw. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  And here's the point. This report is a political whitewash by the Biden administration to shift [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  blame. The report says that our mission had been accomplished. That's why Biden got out of [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=408.0s)]
*  Afghanistan. He's claiming that we eradicated all terrorist threats in Afghanistan. That's why he [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=413.6s)]
*  withdrew to end the longest war. General Kareli said last week, who's the head of CENTCOM, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  that the rise of ISIS-K and al-Qaeda in Afghanistan is so severe, we could be attacked [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  in America in the next six months without warning. So when the Biden administration [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=431.76000000000005s)]
*  tells you there are no terrorists in Afghanistan, they are lying. There's a lethal cocktail forming, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=436.24s)]
*  rise of terrorism, Afghanistan, a broken border here in the United States. It's only a matter of [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=442.4s)]
*  time until there's another 9-11 if we don't change policies. My view of what happened in [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  Afghanistan by Biden was he paved the way for another 9-11. Okay, we're going to talk a lot [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=453.28s)]
*  more about Afghanistan later on in the show, but before you go, I want to talk to you about the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=458.88s)]
*  issue of abortion. We've got two federal judges. There are dueling rulings on the pill that's been [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=462.23999999999995s)]
*  used in abortions approved by the FDA more than 20 years ago. It's an issue that's been a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=468.32s)]
*  struggle for Republicans post-DOMS, that ruling that overturned Roe v. Wade. You're very [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=472.96s)]
*  passionate about this, but critics, including conservatives, say it's costing the Republican [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=476.96s)]
*  Party. Kim Strassel writing in The Wall Street Journal an opinion piece says, [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=481.76s)]
*  conservatives need to decide if they want GOP majorities that will enact common-sense [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=485.2s)]
*  protections or Democratic takeovers that will open the abortion floodgates. That's the choice. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=490.0s)]
*  How much clearer can voters make it? Isn't that what happened this week in Wisconsin where [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=495.84s)]
*  the pro-choice candidate won by 10 points getting a seat on the Wisconsin Supreme Court? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=500.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, I'm very pro-life and I think being pro-life is a winning message. I oppose late-term [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=507.11999999999995s)]
*  abortions. I have a bill to set a national minimum standard of 15 weeks. 50 of the 53 [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=513.04s)]
*  European nations ban abortion at 15 weeks. I have an exception for rape, incest, and life [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=519.6s)]
*  of the mother. In Wisconsin, you had an 1840 statute that banned abortion pretty much across [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=525.44s)]
*  the board, and the Republican Party did not put an alternative on the table. If you're pro-life, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=531.28s)]
*  you need to explain what that means. Here's what it means to me. I want to protect as many babies [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  as possible. I want exceptions for pregnancies as a result of rape, incest. If the life of the [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=542.4s)]
*  mother is in jeopardy, then the family can decide. I do believe in common sense restrictions [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=548.64s)]
*  on abortion. That's where America's at. The democratic solution when it comes to abortion [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=554.56s)]
*  is taxpayer-funded abortion up to the moment of birth. That's barbaric. That's like China. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_ao3ZQqZwU&t=559.6s)]
