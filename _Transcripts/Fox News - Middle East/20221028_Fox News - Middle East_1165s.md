# Ohio Senate candidate JD Vance participates in an RNC 'Get Out the Vote' rally
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 28, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8)
*  Hello Ohio! [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=0.0s)]
*  I love how it's working. It is. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=5.0s)]
*  My uncle's going to put it down. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=8.0s)]
*  So, let's start again. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=10.0s)]
*  Hello Ohio! [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=12.0s)]
*  We're dancing below sea level. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=17.0s)]
*  Are you ready to firetruck tumor? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=21.0s)]
*  We are so happy to be here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=27.0s)]
*  Thank you for everything you've done. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=29.0s)]
*  Ohio is so close to my heart. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=30.0s)]
*  My husband went to Ohio State University. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=33.0s)]
*  I went him through Ohio State. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=35.0s)]
*  I see Ohio State right there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=37.0s)]
*  Because I'm here I'll do an I.O. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=39.0s)]
*  My husband actually works for a company in Ohio. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=42.0s)]
*  And our first home we bought was in Cleveland. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=45.0s)]
*  So, we love this state. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=48.0s)]
*  This state is so near and dear to our heart. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=50.0s)]
*  And you guys, thank you for being here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=52.0s)]
*  I want to thank each and every one of you [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=55.0s)]
*  for coming out in the middle of the day [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=57.0s)]
*  and caring enough about our country [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=59.0s)]
*  to go out and vote and talk to voters [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=61.0s)]
*  and do all the things you're going to do. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=65.0s)]
*  How many of you feel like you're better off [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=67.0s)]
*  than you were two years ago? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=69.0s)]
*  How many of you are feeling the pain of gas prices, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=73.0s)]
*  inflation, home heating, crime, fentanyl? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=76.0s)]
*  Raise your hand. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=81.0s)]
*  We're all feeling it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=83.0s)]
*  We are all feeling it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=85.0s)]
*  Our country is not going in the right direction. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=87.0s)]
*  And the Democrats own it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=89.0s)]
*  They own it. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=91.0s)]
*  They're not running on the things they've done. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=92.0s)]
*  They're not running on their record. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=94.0s)]
*  They're trying to lie to the American people, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=95.0s)]
*  pretend that the things we feel every day are real. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=97.0s)]
*  And it's insulting. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=100.0s)]
*  And the only way you let people know [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=102.0s)]
*  that they're getting it wrong is by firing them. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=104.0s)]
*  And that's what we have to do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=107.0s)]
*  And so JD and Madison and Mike Dwight and Frank [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=109.0s)]
*  and the whole ticket in Ohio is going to make sure [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=112.0s)]
*  that we are standing up as Republicans [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=115.0s)]
*  for every single Ohioan and every single voter [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=117.0s)]
*  and family in this great state. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=121.0s)]
*  So you all look great, but I have some work for you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=123.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=126.0s)]
*  Between now and election day, it's 11 days, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=128.0s)]
*  you need to go talk to everyone you know. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=131.0s)]
*  This isn't just a rally. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=133.0s)]
*  This is every single person back there. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=135.0s)]
*  We need you to go talk to every person you know. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=137.0s)]
*  Your family members, your loved ones, your coworkers, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=140.0s)]
*  the people you go to church with. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=143.0s)]
*  If you have wronged somebody, make it right. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=145.0s)]
*  Okay? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=148.0s)]
*  It's a good time to eat a little humble pie [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=150.0s)]
*  and then go talk about this election. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=153.0s)]
*  Because so much is at stake. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=155.0s)]
*  So much is at stake. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=157.0s)]
*  And so between now and election day, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=159.0s)]
*  I don't want you to do anything else. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=161.0s)]
*  I'm a mom. I'm giving you all a permission slip. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=163.0s)]
*  You can miss every family event, every recital, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=166.0s)]
*  every soccer game, whatever it is, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=169.0s)]
*  because that's how important it is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=171.0s)]
*  We won a house race in 2020 by six votes. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=173.0s)]
*  Six votes. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=177.0s)]
*  You don't want to wake up the day after the election [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=179.0s)]
*  and say, I didn't talk to that neighbor [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=181.0s)]
*  and I didn't talk to that friend. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=183.0s)]
*  Because not everybody's thinking about it at the level we do. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=185.0s)]
*  Not everybody knows that the midterm election is on November 8th. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=187.0s)]
*  I'll tell you what I just did. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=190.0s)]
*  My daughter's in college out in Utah. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=192.0s)]
*  She got her absentee ballot, and she was not returning it. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=194.0s)]
*  I said, if you don't get that ballot in, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=197.0s)]
*  I'm not sending you rent money. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=199.0s)]
*  She knew I was not kidding. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=201.0s)]
*  I was not kidding. I would not. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=205.0s)]
*  So that ballot is in. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=207.0s)]
*  Blackmail's okay, guys. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=209.0s)]
*  It's on the table. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=211.0s)]
*  You all look great. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=213.0s)]
*  You look handsome and beautiful and well rested. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=215.0s)]
*  By November 9th, I want you all to look like crap. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=217.0s)]
*  Because you've done every possible thing you can. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=220.0s)]
*  And I'll be right there with you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=225.0s)]
*  Because I'm traveling the whole country. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=227.0s)]
*  I just want to brag on JD Vance. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=229.0s)]
*  I've known him for a while. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=231.0s)]
*  He's such a great man. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=233.0s)]
*  He's going to be a great senator for Ohio. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=235.0s)]
*  And Madison, how amazing is she? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=237.0s)]
*  She's so great. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=239.0s)]
*  Please, everything you can do between now and election day, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=245.0s)]
*  and aren't you excited to take our country back? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=249.0s)]
*  I can see there's our next speaker who I'm on tour with right now. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=255.0s)]
*  We're on the Take Back Our Country tour. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=261.0s)]
*  No, we're not a band. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=263.0s)]
*  If I were, he would be the lead singer. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=265.0s)]
*  I would be playing the drums, I think. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=267.0s)]
*  But he has taken over the senatorial committee this cycle, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=269.0s)]
*  which means he's helping all the Senate candidates across the country. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=273.0s)]
*  And he works so hard. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=275.0s)]
*  He never rests. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=277.0s)]
*  If there was a supplement that we could sell, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=279.0s)]
*  the Rick Scott supplement, we should all be taking it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=281.0s)]
*  Because he's the most energy of anybody I know. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=283.0s)]
*  And I love, love working with him. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=285.0s)]
*  Please give a big Ohio welcome to the senator from Florida, Rick Scott. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=287.0s)]
*  I'm sure some of you have vacationed or have a house or no relatives in Florida. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=307.0s)]
*  So first, if you need anything from Florida, call me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=311.0s)]
*  That's my primary job. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=315.0s)]
*  So thank you for coming out. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=317.0s)]
*  You know, I've had one primary in three general elections, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=319.0s)]
*  and you're very appreciative when people come out and care about these races. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=323.0s)]
*  Because, you know, we've got to take our country back. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=327.0s)]
*  So what you're doing, you're the reason why we win. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=329.0s)]
*  You know, the candidates have to do their job. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=333.0s)]
*  We have to raise all this ridiculous amounts of money. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=335.0s)]
*  But you get the vote out. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=337.0s)]
*  So thank you for what you're doing. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=339.0s)]
*  Roda McDaniel has done a great job as a chairperson, our chairman of the RNC. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=341.0s)]
*  She's on the list. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=347.0s)]
*  So in my race in 18, when I was the only Republican that won in a swing state in the Senate, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=351.0s)]
*  it was really because of what the RNC did. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=355.0s)]
*  They worked hard to make sure we got our vote out, and we had to get our vote out. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=357.0s)]
*  We had to get 4.3 million votes, which was over a million, 1.2 million votes more than four years earlier. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=361.0s)]
*  So what they do and what you do really makes a difference. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=367.0s)]
*  One person I want to recognize, I don't know if Jane's been recognized yet, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=370.0s)]
*  but I want to recognize Jane Tiffin. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=373.0s)]
*  Jane did a great job as state party chair. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=382.0s)]
*  She ran a great race. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=384.0s)]
*  And what we need to do after these primaries, and primaries are hard on people, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=386.0s)]
*  is we got to come together, and Jane's clearly done that to help JD and make sure we win. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=390.0s)]
*  So thank you, Jane, for what you're doing. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=394.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=397.0s)]
*  This is on the Senate floor, so this is why this race is so important. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=401.0s)]
*  I'm the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=404.0s)]
*  and what I've got to do is make sure I do everything I can to help our candidates win, and we get a majority. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=406.0s)]
*  Right now Chuck Schumer controls everything on the Senate. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=412.0s)]
*  I don't get a vote. My vote doesn't matter. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=416.0s)]
*  Chuck Schumer decides what we vote on, and doesn't give us any amendments. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=418.0s)]
*  And most of our bills, important bills, don't go through committees anymore. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=424.0s)]
*  So we get no amendment votes, we have no say at all, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=427.0s)]
*  and we get even a 50-50 Senate completely controlled by the Democrats and Chuck Schumer. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=431.0s)]
*  So think about it. Think about why we have to win. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=436.0s)]
*  If you look at why JD has to be your senator, let's just go through some of it. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=440.0s)]
*  It's pretty easy. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=445.0s)]
*  Look at gas prices. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=446.0s)]
*  The Democrats did that. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=448.0s)]
*  Biden and the Democrats have done all these things. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=450.0s)]
*  They hate fossil fuel. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=452.0s)]
*  That means you've got high gas prices for poor people and people on fixed income. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=454.0s)]
*  In my state I've got a lot of people that are retired going back to work. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=457.0s)]
*  I was in earlier today in Wisconsin with Ron Johnson, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=461.0s)]
*  and some guy came up before we got on his bus. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=465.0s)]
*  He said, my wife just went back to work. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=468.0s)]
*  Because they're eight, seventy-seven years old, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=470.0s)]
*  and people are going back to work. They're going to food banks, they're never gone. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=473.0s)]
*  Look at food prices. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=476.0s)]
*  I talked to my little brother, he says, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=478.0s)]
*  I mean, he's retired, he was a principal at school, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=480.0s)]
*  and he works at a grocery store. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=484.0s)]
*  He says, it's still hard to make ends meet with food prices. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=486.0s)]
*  The Democrats have done this. It's intentional what they're doing. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=489.0s)]
*  Look at the border. The border is completely open. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=492.0s)]
*  It's open. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=495.0s)]
*  By the way, do you realize, if you come across the border, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=497.0s)]
*  they give you an ice-res-rock if they don't know anything about you, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=500.0s)]
*  and an hour later you can go get on a commercial flight. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=503.0s)]
*  They did this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=507.0s)]
*  Look at all the fentanyl. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=509.0s)]
*  My wife and I got married when we were 19. We had grandkids. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=511.0s)]
*  Every time I tell them, I talk to them about fentanyl drug problems. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=514.0s)]
*  Don't take anything from somebody else. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=518.0s)]
*  The Democrats did this. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=521.0s)]
*  What in the living delights are they doing? [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=523.0s)]
*  So you can go through, whether it's inflation, or woke military, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=526.0s)]
*  or whether it's the border. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=529.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a simple equation. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=531.0s)]
*  We've got to elect J.D. and we've got to get a majority. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=534.0s)]
*  We're going to get a majority, I believe. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=537.0s)]
*  I think we're going to win 52 seats plus. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=539.0s)]
*  It's really up to you guys. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=542.0s)]
*  It's getting the votes out. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=544.0s)]
*  We have got to bust our butts to get the votes out. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=546.0s)]
*  And so we've got to every day, we've got to say, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=549.0s)]
*  who else can we get to the polls? [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=551.0s)]
*  The door knockers, the people who make phone calls, our friends, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=553.0s)]
*  all these things, it matters. That's how we win these races. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=555.0s)]
*  And then when we win, we've got to govern. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=558.0s)]
*  And we've got to govern the right way. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=560.0s)]
*  We've got to say, we're going to change the direction of this country [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=562.0s)]
*  back to a country where everybody, every kid, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=564.0s)]
*  every kid grew up in a poor family. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=566.0s)]
*  A kid like me grew up in a poor family [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=568.0s)]
*  and has every reason to believe they can be anything. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=570.0s)]
*  That's the country we have to make for everybody. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=572.0s)]
*  And J.D. advances that person. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=574.0s)]
*  The first time I talked to J.D., I said, [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=576.0s)]
*  you just tell your story of what you went through. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=578.0s)]
*  Thank God you lived in this country. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=581.0s)]
*  Thank God you had grandparents. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=583.0s)]
*  Because you got to live the dream of this country. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=586.0s)]
*  J.D. will go to D.C. and he will not worry about what a rail says. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=588.0s)]
*  He will worry about what Ohioans want. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=593.0s)]
*  So it's my distinct honor to introduce somebody [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=596.0s)]
*  that I look forward to serving with, J.D. Vance. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=598.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=601.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=604.0s)]
*  You should make me say something before you clap for me. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=617.0s)]
*  I want to say first of all thanks to Rick Scott [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=621.0s)]
*  and the whole team for being here. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=623.0s)]
*  The NRSC, Ronna, thank you for being here. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=625.0s)]
*  It's great to see you. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=628.0s)]
*  I want to give a special shout out to Jane Timken for being here. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=630.0s)]
*  I really appreciate it, Jane. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=633.0s)]
*  I really appreciate everything you've done. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=635.0s)]
*  And of course, you guys know better than anybody, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=641.0s)]
*  I'm going to go fire Chuck Schimmer. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=644.0s)]
*  Madison's going to fire Nancy Pelosi. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=646.0s)]
*  What a beautiful baby they have. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=650.0s)]
*  It's amazing to me how much energy and passion [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=655.0s)]
*  Madison brings to this race. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=659.0s)]
*  The fact that she's out campaigning at all, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=661.0s)]
*  you would never believe she had a baby four weeks ago. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=663.0s)]
*  And here she is getting us fired up [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=665.0s)]
*  and getting us ready to win this race. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=667.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the stakes of this election [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=669.0s)]
*  and let's talk about what we're really fighting for. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=671.0s)]
*  A lot of you guys know my story. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=673.0s)]
*  Rick kind of talked about it a little bit. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=675.0s)]
*  Look, I'm a product of the American dream. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=677.0s)]
*  I'm a product of a country where if you work hard [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=679.0s)]
*  and play by the rules, you can achieve great things, [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=681.0s)]
*  whether you come from a rich or a poor family, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=684.0s)]
*  a black or a white family, and what an incredible thing it is [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=686.0s)]
*  that it's possible for our kids to achieve their dreams [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=689.0s)]
*  in this country that all of us love. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=692.0s)]
*  But I've got to say, the very thing that made it possible [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=694.0s)]
*  for me to succeed in this country, [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=697.0s)]
*  the very thing that made it possible for me to become [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=699.0s)]
*  a husband and a father, the thing that I really wanted to do [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=701.0s)]
*  when I was a kid was give my kids the things that I didn't have [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=704.0s)]
*  when I was growing up. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=708.0s)]
*  And that's the way in which this state and this country [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=710.0s)]
*  has been best to me. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=712.0s)]
*  But that doesn't happen without careful investment. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=714.0s)]
*  It doesn't happen unless we preserve the American dream [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=716.0s)]
*  into the next generation. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=719.0s)]
*  What we're doing right now, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=721.0s)]
*  what the leadership of this country is doing [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=723.0s)]
*  is plundering what our grandparents and our parents gave us. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=725.0s)]
*  And it's time on November the 8th to fight back [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=729.0s)]
*  and take the fight to the Democrats in Washington, D.C. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=732.0s)]
*  That's exactly what we're going to do. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=735.0s)]
*  We have to. The country depends on it. God bless you. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=737.0s)]
*  Just think about this. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=746.0s)]
*  The law and order that we cast aside, I'm 38 years old. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=748.0s)]
*  For the first 36 years of my life, we had violent crime going down, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=752.0s)]
*  murders going down, carjackings going down, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=756.0s)]
*  and now they're going in the wrong direction. Why? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=759.0s)]
*  Because our leadership decided to declare war on the police. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=762.0s)]
*  I think we ought to declare war on the violent criminals [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=765.0s)]
*  and let the police go and do their job, right? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=768.0s)]
*  Tim Ryan and Joe Biden said that they would not raise taxes on the middle class. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=775.0s)]
*  What a joke. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=780.0s)]
*  Now, it's wrong on its own terms. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=782.0s)]
*  They raised taxes on the middle class like four weeks ago [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=784.0s)]
*  with the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=787.0s)]
*  They took out 86,000 IRS agents after middle class Ohioans [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=790.0s)]
*  to collect those tax increases. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=794.0s)]
*  And even if you ignore that, the inflation that we're experiencing right now [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=796.0s)]
*  to the tune of $6,000 a year falls hardest on the middle class in this state. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=800.0s)]
*  And it's not because we have any problem in this country [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=805.0s)]
*  except for bad leadership. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=809.0s)]
*  What's going on in this country right now is that we have leaders [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=811.0s)]
*  who shut down our energy sector, leaders who raised taxes [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=814.0s)]
*  and borrowed and spent too much money, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=817.0s)]
*  leaders who set violent criminals loose, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=819.0s)]
*  and leaders who decided to throw open the gates of the United States southern border. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=822.0s)]
*  And I happen to think that's not leadership, that's cowardice. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=827.0s)]
*  Let's fire these guys in a couple of weeks. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=831.0s)]
*  Now, this is of course, it's great to be at the Stark County GOP headquarters, [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=841.0s)]
*  great to be at the Madison, Jesse Otto GOP headquarters here, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=846.0s)]
*  but maybe we should have invited Tim Ryan, [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=850.0s)]
*  because he's a Republican now, right? [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=853.0s)]
*  That's what he says in all of his TV advertisements. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=855.0s)]
*  We were with Donald Trump Jr. a couple of weeks ago. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=857.0s)]
*  He said, JD, why didn't you invite Tim Ryan? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=859.0s)]
*  I heard from his TV commercials he's my biggest fan now. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=862.0s)]
*  And that is the battle in our Senate race, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=867.0s)]
*  We've got to elect our governor, our secretary of state, our attorney general, [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=871.0s)]
*  our great Supreme Court justices, Sharon Kennedy, Pat Derwein, and Pat Fisher. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=875.0s)]
*  But in the Senate, we have a slightly different task, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=884.0s)]
*  because we have a Democrat who is running as far away from the Democrat party as he possibly can. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=887.0s)]
*  And who can blame him, right? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=891.0s)]
*  Who can blame him after the last two years of failed Democrat leadership? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=893.0s)]
*  I saw his commercial recently where he said that he only agrees with his wife 70% of the time. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=897.0s)]
*  Tim, that must be awkward at home, because you agree with Nancy Pelosi 100% of the time. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=903.0s)]
*  I don't think the voting record says. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=907.0s)]
*  But look, here is the problem. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=909.0s)]
*  This guy is not the moderate that he pretends to be. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=911.0s)]
*  He is not an independent voice in Washington, D.C. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=915.0s)]
*  He's a guy who bends the knee to Nancy Pelosi and does what he's told. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=918.0s)]
*  And if we give him a promotion to the Senate, which we're not going to do, [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=921.0s)]
*  he's going to do the exact same thing with Chuck Schumer. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=924.0s)]
*  And I happen to think that Tim Ryan, you know, he's lived off the government teeth for long enough. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=927.0s)]
*  Let's send him back to Youngstown. Let's force him to get a real job. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=931.0s)]
*  And let's promote me to the Democratic Party. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=934.0s)]
*  So here's where I want to close, ladies and gentlemen. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=943.0s)]
*  I've got a job to do, of course. It's to get out there. It's to talk to as many people. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=945.0s)]
*  It's to make sure that we stay on the airwaves, radio, TV, digital media, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=949.0s)]
*  so that we can reach those all-important undecided voters. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=953.0s)]
*  But here's the thing that I'd ask from each and every one of you. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=956.0s)]
*  Go out there and talk to as many people as possible. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=959.0s)]
*  And tell them two things. Number one, why you're voting for me. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=962.0s)]
*  And number two, why you're voting against Tim Ryan. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=965.0s)]
*  As much as the Democrats have the biggest super PAC in the world on their side, [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=967.0s)]
*  and of course I'm talking about the corporate media, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=972.0s)]
*  we have the people and we have the truth. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=974.0s)]
*  But that only works if we get out there and do the work necessary to get people to the polls, [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=977.0s)]
*  to tell them that truth, and if every single one of you leave here [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=983.0s)]
*  and text or call or stop by the house of ten friends [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=987.0s)]
*  and make sure they get to the polls and make sure they vote for me, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=992.0s)]
*  I believe we're going to win this race and we're going to win it in a very, very convincing fashion. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=995.0s)]
*  So we've got ten days. Ten days to sprint to the finish line and save this country. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1000.0s)]
*  And I'd maybe just leave it on this note. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1005.0s)]
*  A good friend of mine who was very influential to me returning to my Christian faith [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1008.0s)]
*  once told me about a year and a half ago when I was whining [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1012.0s)]
*  about the condition this country was in and I was talking about how Biden was doing this [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1015.0s)]
*  and Biden was doing that and Chuck Schumer was doing that [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1020.0s)]
*  and he kind of snapped me out of it and said, JD, despair is a sin. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1022.0s)]
*  I've thought a lot about that the last year and a half because in this moment, ladies and gentlemen, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1026.0s)]
*  we're not called to despair about this country. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1030.0s)]
*  We're not called to be depressed about this country. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1033.0s)]
*  We're called to get in the fight and save it in ten days. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1036.0s)]
*  That's exactly what we're going to do. Let's get to work. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1039.0s)]
*  Now, let me kick it back over to the great Madison Jesse Otter. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1041.0s)]
*  Alright, I need a favor from you guys. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1058.0s)]
*  Every single day we're doing a countdown video for the campaign. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1060.0s)]
*  So I thought what better time to do it than today while you guys are all here at our headquarters. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1063.0s)]
*  So will you join me for this video? [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1066.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1068.0s)]
*  Alright, I'm going to come here. We're going to take it from the other way. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1069.0s)]
*  I brought my sister to help. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1074.0s)]
*  So I'm going to turn it over to you guys. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1076.0s)]
*  You're going to let people know how many days and get out to vote. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1077.0s)]
*  So just say 11 days, get out to vote. Sound good? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1079.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1081.0s)]
*  Okay, let's do it. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1082.0s)]
*  Hey everybody, we're out here at the headquarters. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1083.0s)]
*  We are Texas Energy! [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1085.0s)]
*  And we are so excited. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1088.0s)]
*  This is the Republican energy. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1090.0s)]
*  People are ready to take back the House, take back the Senate, and fire Nancy Pelosi. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1091.0s)]
*  USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA, USA. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1099.0s)]
*  Alright, what are we going to remind people to do on or before November 8? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1118.0s)]
*  vote! [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1121.0s)]
*  Thank you guys. Get out to vote. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1123.0s)]
*  That's about that. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1159.0s)]
*  Pretty nice. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1161.0s)]
*  JD, yeah, perfect. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1162.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Orszej2e8&t=1163.0s)]
