# This is the best deal Israel could get from Biden: Foreign policy expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg)
*  Thank you for more on the Ukraine-Russia war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's welcome the Foundation for Defense of Democracy's founder and president and personal [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=2.24s)]
*  friend of many years, one of the smartest guys I know, Cliff Maycliffe. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=7.12s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=10.48s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=11.48s)]
*  Hope you had a great Thanksgiving. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=12.48s)]
*  I did. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=13.48s)]
*  Boy, the news doesn't take a break. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=14.48s)]
*  And we've got several hot fronts, as they say. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=15.48s)]
*  But let's start, Cliff, with this Zelensky maybe suggesting, because he has been steadfast, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=18.2s)]
*  I interviewed him back in July, he's been steadfast on not yielding any territory, recognizing [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=25.28s)]
*  any territory Russians gained. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  What do you make of this latest development? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=33.08s)]
*  Look, he doesn't want to yield territory, of course. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=35.04s)]
*  He understands Trump's coming in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=38.44s)]
*  He understands Trump's a dealmaker. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=39.84s)]
*  What does a deal look like? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=41.8s)]
*  A deal looks like, I think, Ukraine keeps its independence but loses some territory. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=42.8s)]
*  By the way, there was a war that Russia fought against Finland in 1939 called the Winter [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=49.08s)]
*  War. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=53.0s)]
*  Again, same kind of thing. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=54.0s)]
*  The Finns were outnumbered, outgunned, but they did a great job. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=55.08s)]
*  What did, how did it end? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=57.68s)]
*  Finland lost 10 percent of its territory but retained its independence. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=59.24s)]
*  You could have something like this. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=62.2s)]
*  Putin only wants an off-ramp if the road ahead of him is bumpy. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=63.84s)]
*  And everything can be done to make that bumpy. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=68.74s)]
*  So he says, OK, I will settle for Crimea. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=70.52s)]
*  I will settle for some of Donbass. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=72.92s)]
*  But I need to freeze this in place. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=75.1s)]
*  After it's frozen in place, if that's what happens, then you've got to supply a lot of [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=76.44s)]
*  to Ukraine so they can deter Russia from a third invasion. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=81.56s)]
*  That's great insight. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=85.92s)]
*  But on the flip side of that, Zelensky also needs a major, at least PR win in all of this [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=86.92s)]
*  so that his fellow countrymen and women can feel like they got something out of it in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=93.18s)]
*  addition to just ending the war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  If their independence is preserved, they've gotten something out of it. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=101.4s)]
*  It's not everything they would have wanted. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=105.72s)]
*  It's not everything they deserve. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=107.4s)]
*  Don't forget what I've been saying for years. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=109.88s)]
*  Putin sees himself as the czar. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=112.28s)]
*  And what does the czar try to do in bad times? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=114.76s)]
*  Restore the Russian Empire. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=117.08s)]
*  What does restore the Russian Empire mean? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=118.2s)]
*  And Ukraine has to be ruled by the Kremlin. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=120.8s)]
*  If Ukraine is not ruled by the Kremlin, it's not a full win for Putin by any means. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=123.52s)]
*  And from a U.S. point of view, if Ukraine remains independent, that helps protect Poland. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=128.12s)]
*  It helps protect Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, NATO, all of those countries, even Moldova, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  which is not NATO, all of that in the American interest, it might be best at this point to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=138.79999999999998s)]
*  freeze the conflict, make sure Ukraine retains its independence, and then make it a pork [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  you pine hard for a predator to eat. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=149.12s)]
*  Let's shift to this very delicate, it appears, ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=151.6s)]
*  We're already seeing it being challenged. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=157.23999999999998s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had this to say about it. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=159.39999999999998s)]
*  This ceasefire in the north is a Biden administration's last dish of temper to say, see, look, we [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=163.88s)]
*  did something, we solved a problem, frankly, a problem that they created the conditions [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=168.28s)]
*  for, sort of like the arsonists putting the fire out. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, the conditions haven't changed. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=177.04s)]
*  The Iranians are still trying to destroy Israel and the United States of America. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=179.35999999999999s)]
*  Cliff, your thoughts? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=183.92s)]
*  He's not wrong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=185.04s)]
*  On the other hand, I would say, and look, the ceasefire is very controversial within [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=186.04s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=190.6s)]
*  The Israelis are arguing among themselves. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=191.6s)]
*  They tend to do that anyhow. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=192.95999999999998s)]
*  However, I would say it's the best deal Israel could get, not the best deal it could get [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=194.32s)]
*  from Hezbollah, the best deal it could get from Biden. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=198.07999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=200.48s)]
*  Among other things, because Israel needs the replenishment of munitions to continue the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=201.48s)]
*  seven-front war that's going on. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=206.56s)]
*  Those were being held up. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=208.6s)]
*  Now I think that they're in train again. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=209.76s)]
*  So that's very important. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=212.92s)]
*  They don't want Biden to do what Obama did on his way out the door when he, in his lame [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=214.12s)]
*  duck period, stabbed Israel in the back at the U.N. Security Council. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=218.44s)]
*  If that's been prevented, that's pretty good for Israel. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=222.56s)]
*  I think the Israelis absolutely know they cannot leave it to the Lebanese Armed Forces [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=226.32s)]
*  or to UNIFIL to make sure that violations are addressed. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=230.48000000000002s)]
*  They won't be. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, will have to do that and they will do that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  And I think they would rather ask for forgiveness than permission to do that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=239.6s)]
*  And once Trump comes in, I don't think Trump will mind if the Israelis take out an arms [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=244.32s)]
*  depot or a launcher. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, we've seen them sort of taking that stance. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=249.20000000000002s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=251.24s)]
*  We'll be following that. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=252.24s)]
*  As we're just reporting today, Aleppo, the fight in Syria, Syrian opposition, rebels [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=253.8s)]
*  going after Bashar al-Assad in the capital city. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=259.56s)]
*  Yeah, tricky situation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=263.76s)]
*  OK, Bashar al-Assad, dictator of Syria, terrible guy, has killed like 600,000 of his people, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=265.2s)]
*  made six million or so homeless, terrible guy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=270.2s)]
*  It seemed that he had won the civil war thanks to Tehran, thanks to the Russians, thanks [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=274.08s)]
*  to Hezbollah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=281.64s)]
*  All are weakened, which may be why the rebels have been able to take Aleppo. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  But these rebels are not great rebels. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=286.64s)]
*  These are Salafi jihadists backed by Erdogan in Turkey. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  So what's happened now? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=293.2s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad, we believe, has gone up and asked Putin, please, I need more help, I need [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=295.08s)]
*  more help. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=299.4s)]
*  And Putin, as you know, is stretched a little thin right now. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=300.4s)]
*  Hezbollah can't do very much. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=302.8s)]
*  Not clear that the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, can do very much right now. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  But that's what Assad is asking for. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=310.28s)]
*  It's a very volatile situation. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=312.32s)]
*  It reminds me of something Kissinger once said, wouldn't it be nice, or something like this, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=315.64s)]
*  he said, wouldn't it be nice if both sides could lose? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=320.03999999999996s)]
*  And actually, most both sides could possibly lose here with a little assistance from a [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=322.52s)]
*  clever United States. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  It's really quite something when someone like you can put into context how it's all intertwined [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=327.55999999999995s)]
*  between Hezbollah saving Assad and really Putin behind the curtain. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=332.67999999999995s)]
*  A lot to pack in and a lot to watch. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=337.23999999999995s)]
*  Cliff May, thank you for being here as always. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=339.64s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=341.72s)]
*  Great pleasure to be with you, Griff. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vw5a4ITBbCg&t=342.72s)]
