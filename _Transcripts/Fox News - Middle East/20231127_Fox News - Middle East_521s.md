# The left is giving Biden hell over this: Mike Waltz
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4)
*  Ooh, President Biden is hearing it from all sides over his handling of the Israel-Hamas [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=0.0s)]
*  war. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=5.88s)]
*  Republican Senator Tom Cotton, who's on intelligence and Armed Services Committee, says Biden needs [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=6.88s)]
*  to focus more on the enemy. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=12.52s)]
*  I have to say, it seems like President Biden puts more pressure on Israel than he does [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=14.0s)]
*  on Hamas and its hosts in Qatar. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=19.32s)]
*  Part of the reasons why we got to this point where we had to have a four-day pause is the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=22.34s)]
*  Biden administration has consistently, behind the scenes, insisted that Israel's government [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=27.32s)]
*  take steps that are clearly not in Israel's interest, for instance, providing fuel into [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=31.92s)]
*  Gaza, not just water or food or medicine, but fuel, which may as well be providing them [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  with ammunition. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=41.64s)]
*  Some on the far left of Biden's own political party say he's too soft on Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=44.36s)]
*  His overall approval among Democrats now is 75 percent in one new poll. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=50.56s)]
*  But it drops to 60 percent on his handling of the war. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=56.6s)]
*  Republican Congressman Mike Walsh of Florida, member of the Armed Services, Foreign Affairs, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=61.08s)]
*  and Intelligence Committees, also a former Green Beret commander, we appreciate his being [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=65.92s)]
*  with us and always for your service as well. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=70.86s)]
*  So where does the far left want Biden to be on a bunch of serial killers? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=73.84s)]
*  Like they want him to hang out with them? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=80.2s)]
*  Yeah, Harris, but I think you have to appreciate the propaganda war and the psychological warfare [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=83.56s)]
*  that Hamas is, I think, fairly successfully waging here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=91.75999999999999s)]
*  I mean, they're presenting themselves right now as some kind of humanitarian, as you have [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=95.96s)]
*  these hallmark type moments as they hand the hostages back. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=100.6s)]
*  They presented themselves as the victim. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=104.88s)]
*  Can I just point out one number that is just driving me nuts is this casualty figure that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=107.48s)]
*  the mainstream media has taken on as gospel, this 12000 to 14000 Palestinian casualties [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  compared to the 1500 Israelis. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=120.92s)]
*  Why are we taking that number and running with it? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=123.12s)]
*  We wouldn't believe that coming from ISIS. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=126.52000000000001s)]
*  We certainly wouldn't believe it coming from Putin. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=128.6s)]
*  But yet the media is running that, which makes it seem like a disproportionate response. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  So and then you have and then you have years and years of kind of victimhood and the Palestinians [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=135.32s)]
*  as part of the oppressed. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=141.84s)]
*  And you're seeing all of that come to fruition right now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=143.76s)]
*  And the left is giving Biden hell. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=146.52s)]
*  And when you have leaks coming from the White House saying we're taking on a lot of political [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=149.16s)]
*  water here, I worry about Biden getting weak need and its support of Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=152.8s)]
*  So I'll pile on a little bit more. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=157.32s)]
*  You talk about some of the media, the legacy and liberal media taking Hamas's word for [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=159.4s)]
*  everything or anything. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=165.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=167.72s)]
*  But we know that there were just unthinkable, unspeakable sex crimes, even with children [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  Where are the women at the United Nations? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  Where are these groups that say that they care about what happens to women and children [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=182.28s)]
*  in particular, all groups of people? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=187.44s)]
*  I mean, maybe I miss something over Thanksgiving, but I don't think so. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=189.6s)]
*  I've horribly seen this my entire career, from the Taliban to ISIS to al-Qaeda and Hamas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=195.72s)]
*  They use rape as a weapon. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=202.8s)]
*  It is grotesque. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=205.72s)]
*  But against Israeli and Jewish women, I mean, it's silent. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=206.72s)]
*  Yeah, no, that's right. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=213.08s)]
*  But then where are they also on just the abuse of women, the abuse of minorities, the abuse [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  of the LGBTQ community under the thumb of the Hamas dictatorship? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=219.8s)]
*  So it makes no sense. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=225.44s)]
*  Don't ask me to ascribe logic to it. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  But I can tell you this divide on the left is running deep and it's running fast. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=230.32s)]
*  And again, I worry about the steadfastness. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=236.36s)]
*  But the longer term issue, the biggest thing that Biden could do for Israel, and Senator [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=238.92000000000002s)]
*  Cotton was absolutely right, is shift its policy on Iran. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=242.88s)]
*  No matter how successful Israel is tactically against Hamas, as long as Iran is flush with [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=247.16s)]
*  cash, they are going to continue pumping in arms and supplies, fighters, training. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=252.84s)]
*  And that's where we have to return to maximum pressure. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=260.32s)]
*  But they've made money with this administration since the start. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=262.12s)]
*  I mean, Biden has given them billions more since October 7. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=265.76s)]
*  I mean, it's more than just policy. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=270.68s)]
*  It's a complete mindset. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=273.04s)]
*  It's a focus. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=274.56s)]
*  A significant escalation. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=275.56s)]
*  And I want to get to this with you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=276.96s)]
*  It's military and the attacks on our U.S. men and women stationed in the region in the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=278.84s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=283.79999999999995s)]
*  The U.S. stopped the seizure of an Israel-linked ship off the coast of Yemen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=284.79999999999995s)]
*  U.S. Navy personnel aboard the USS Mason responded to a distress call from an Israeli-linked [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=289.88s)]
*  ship after it was targeted by hijackers off the coast of Yemen. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  Sources are telling Fox News five armed men have been arrested and are now being questioned [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=301.79999999999995s)]
*  by the U.S. military. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=306.79999999999995s)]
*  Houthi forces, those who are Iran-backed out of Yemen, then fired two ballistic missiles [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=308.28000000000003s)]
*  at USS Mason after those arrests. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=314.44s)]
*  We are now up to 73 attacks by Iran proxies on American forces in Iraq and Syria since [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=317.6s)]
*  October 17. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=326.16s)]
*  Mark Dubowitz, CEO of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, with this. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=328.44s)]
*  President Biden probably deserves an A for his Hamas policy, but I think he deserves [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=334.48s)]
*  an F for his Iran policy because behind the scenes in Tehran is the Supreme Leader Ali [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=338.12s)]
*  Khamenei, who really is orchestrating all of this. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=343.8s)]
*  I mean, he has provided hundreds of millions of dollars to Hamas, billions of dollars to [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=346.16s)]
*  Hezbollah, the other terrorist organization currently fighting Israel on the northern [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  border, to the Houthi terrorists in Yemen who are firing missiles at Israel as we speak. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=353.20000000000005s)]
*  Wow. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  Did you hear Dubowitz? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=360.68s)]
*  He said President Biden deserves an A for the way he's dealing with Hamas. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=361.88s)]
*  Well, but he also, but let's go with the F on Iran because that's the long game. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=368.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=372.68s)]
*  And he's absolutely right. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=373.44s)]
*  And here's what everybody has to understand. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=374.68s)]
*  Two things. One, every missile, the training for how to fire them, the supplies, everything, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=376.2s)]
*  whether it's Hezbollah or the Houthis, comes from Iran and it's being funded by global [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=382.68s)]
*  oil prices. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=388.0s)]
*  I mean, that it is as simple as that. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=389.32s)]
*  And again, part of the reversal we have to see here, Harris, is the White House continues, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=392.32s)]
*  watch their language, to talk about avoiding escalation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=397.8s)]
*  We want to deescalate. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=401.08s)]
*  The more they try to deescalate, the more they're hesitant and recalcitrant, the more [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=402.68s)]
*  they're actually allowing Iran the space to escalate the situation. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=407.04s)]
*  What do you do with the schoolyard bully? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=411.72s)]
*  You can't keep giving him lunch money hoping he'll go away. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=413.44s)]
*  At some point, you've got to punch him in the nose, whether that's through cyber or [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=416.72s)]
*  whether it's through some of the Iranian IRGC officials in the region or on Iran itself. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=420.52000000000004s)]
*  Until you raise costs on them, they're going to continue to do this. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  I want everybody just to take a look at that map again that we keep showing with those [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=429.24s)]
*  73 attacks. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=433.0s)]
*  And A, from a Hamas perspective, I mean, they must love this president based on what Dubowitz [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=434.40000000000003s)]
*  just said. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=441.52000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's unbelievable. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=442.52000000000004s)]
*  If you attacked anything 73 times, if somebody attacked your car 73 times, there would be [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=443.68s)]
*  cries in the street, oh my goodness, get to that car. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=451.35999999999996s)]
*  These are our people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=453.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=455.64s)]
*  Well, look, FDD is great. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=456.64s)]
*  I don't know that I'd give them an A because right now the Hamas terrorists are dictating [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  the terms. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=464.76s)]
*  They are deciding who gets released, when they get released, how long the ceasefire [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmYhbt7slb4&t=465.76s)]
