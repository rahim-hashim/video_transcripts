# Harris must toe the Biden admin's line on foreign policy: Marc Thiessen
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo)
*  Vice President Harris attending that Situation Room meeting along with President Biden and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=0.0s)]
*  the national security team. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=6.28s)]
*  Let's bring in the Washington Post, Mark Thiessen, also a Fox News contributor. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=7.88s)]
*  So we're on the edge of what could explode into a war that could engulf the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=11.88s)]
*  This Middle East war between Israel and Gaza occurred on Biden's watch, as did Afghanistan. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=17.580000000000002s)]
*  We're likely going to see a picture of Kamala Harris very close to the president in the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Situation Room talking about this situation. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=29.12s)]
*  But does she have the chops to handle a hot zone like this? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=31.36s)]
*  I don't think she does, but it's a very tough situation because, of course, most vice presidents [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=34.6s)]
*  who run for president do so after they've left office. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=39.24s)]
*  They're not actually sitting vice presidents. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=42.08s)]
*  We've only had one sitting vice president who's won the presidency in one hundred and [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=43.44s)]
*  eighty eight years, which was George H.W. Bush. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=47.6s)]
*  The previous last person to do it before him was Martin Van Buren in 1836. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=50.6s)]
*  So it's a very unusual situation for a sitting president, vice president to win the presidency. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=55.4s)]
*  And several have tried. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=60.32s)]
*  Al Gore. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=61.64s)]
*  Al Gore did. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=62.64s)]
*  I'll never get that 18 months of my life back. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=63.64s)]
*  But that was a time of peace, right? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=65.64s)]
*  That was a time of peace for the most part. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=67.48s)]
*  We were a couple of years, we were a year before 9-11. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=69.44s)]
*  And then you had Bush, which was at the Paris Storica in Gloucester, the Cold War was about [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=72.54s)]
*  to end. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Really the analogy is 1968 with Lyndon Johnson, where you had a war raging, just like we have [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  two wars raging in the world right now. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=84.28s)]
*  You have Vietnam raging. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=85.64s)]
*  And and so how Hubert Humphrey, his vice president, ran after Lyndon Johnson decided not to run. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  And Johnson actually stopped the bombing, suspended the bombing in Vietnam to help him [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=93.4s)]
*  because of the anti-war protesters. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=97.84s)]
*  So it's fascinating right now the political pressures on Biden, whether he does something [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=99.6s)]
*  in the Middle East with regard to Israel to help her with the anti with the pro-Hamas protesters [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  who were ruling the Democratic Party because they're both meet. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=108.8s)]
*  Both those conventions were in Chicago. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=111.2s)]
*  1968 and the current one. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=113.08s)]
*  So there's a lot of analogies between now and 1968. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=114.36s)]
*  So while we're coming to the end of his presidency, to your point, there's still a lot that can [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=116.52s)]
*  happen. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=120.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=121.64s)]
*  And to have her involved in these high level meetings is a bit unprecedented, but interesting. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=122.64s)]
*  So how involved do you believe or are you hearing she is? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=127.4s)]
*  So constitutionally, the vice president's only role in foreign policy is to advise the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=130.5s)]
*  president. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=134.8s)]
*  So she has no line authority. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=135.8s)]
*  She's not in the military chain of command, but she has to tow the administration line [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=137.44s)]
*  because you can only have one commander in chief at the same time at a time. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  And so you can't have a situation where the vice president is going off and making her [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=145.51999999999998s)]
*  own foreign policy when she's the sitting vice president of the administration, because [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=148.56s)]
*  that's in a divided message into the world. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=152.39999999999998s)]
*  So if she wants to be tougher on Israel for the purpose of winning over voters in Dearborn, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=154.89999999999998s)]
*  she really has to stay true to whatever Biden ends up doing in the Middle East. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  The real danger is that Biden makes decisions about what's happening in the Middle East [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=163.88s)]
*  in order to help her win the presidency, which could be really troubling. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=168.28s)]
*  So she's side by side with the president right now on the brink of what could be an escalation [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  to lead to a wider war in the Middle East. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=176.56s)]
*  She was also side by side with the president when he made the decision to withdraw from [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=178.52s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=182.60000000000002s)]
*  We know how badly that went. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  Let's get in the way back machine and go back to August the 18th, 2021, when Kamala Harris [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=186.04000000000002s)]
*  talked about being right there with the president, making the decision about Afghanistan. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=192.58s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=197.0s)]
*  President Biden always said that he wants you to be the last person in the room, particularly [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=198.68s)]
*  for big decisions, just as he was for President Obama. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=203.28s)]
*  He just made a really big decision. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=206.36s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=208.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=209.2s)]
*  Were you the last person in the room? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=210.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=211.68s)]
*  And you feel comfortable? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=212.68s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=214.04s)]
*  Well, the covid distancing was wild, too. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=215.04s)]
*  So does she own Afghanistan as well? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=218.12s)]
*  And can Trump try to leverage that against her? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=220.8s)]
*  Well, the problem is she owns everything because it's the Biden-Harris administration. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=222.96s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  She's running away from it as fast as she can. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  So she owns Afghanistan. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  She was there, the last person in the room. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=231.24s)]
*  She owns that debacle. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=232.96s)]
*  She also owns the border. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=233.96s)]
*  She's trying to desperately run against it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=234.96s)]
*  We border national security. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=236.72s)]
*  She's trying to run against it and say, well, she wasn't the border czar. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=238.60000000000002s)]
*  If the border was a huge success, she'd be claiming to be the border czar. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  She'd say, of course, I wear like a badge of honor. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=245.28s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=247.32s)]
*  So she's got this, she's one of the straight jackets you're in, especially when you're [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=248.32s)]
*  serving the worst president of my lifetime, which has unleashed a series of disasters [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=251.36s)]
*  unparalleled since Jimmy Carter, is that you own those disasters and you're constrained [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=255.96s)]
*  in your ability to distance yourself from them because you're the city vice president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  As you're talking, I'm noticing the Dow falling even further. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=263.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't blame me for that. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  I do not take ownership of that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=269.96000000000004s)]
*  My goodness is down more than a thousand now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=271.96000000000004s)]
*  I'm not in any administration. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=273.96000000000004s)]
*  I have no power to do anything. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=274.96000000000004s)]
*  I just come to talk to you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=276.96000000000004s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=277.96000000000004s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=279.96000000000004s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=280.96000000000004s)]
*  We'll see you at the convention. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=281.96000000000004s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=282.96000000000004s)]
*  Can't wait. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=283.96000000000004s)]
*  Hey everyone. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGyxTd39zxo&t=284.96s)]
