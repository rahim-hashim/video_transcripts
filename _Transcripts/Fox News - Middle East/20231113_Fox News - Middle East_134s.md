# Scathing State Department memo urges 'reckless' Biden to demand cease-fire
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM)
*  Dana, a leaked internal State Department memo reportedly slams President Biden's policy [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=0.0s)]
*  on the Israel-Hamas war, urging him to reassess his strong support for the Jewish state. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=4.72s)]
*  Rich Edsons live at the State Department with more. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Hello, Rich. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=12.4s)]
*  OK, good morning, Mike. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=13.4s)]
*  Well, about 100 State Department employees have signed on to this memo, pushing the Biden [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=14.8s)]
*  administration to demand a cease-fire in Gaza. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=18.84s)]
*  This is according to Axios, which has taken a look at this memo here, report there, saying, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=22.34s)]
*  quote, members of the White House and National Security Council displayed a clear disregard [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=27.52s)]
*  for the lives of Palestinians, a documented unwillingness to de-escalate, and even prior [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  to October 7th, a reckless lack of strategic foresight. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=37.04s)]
*  This is as Secretary of State Antony Blinken, traveling in India last week, said that, quote, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=41.76s)]
*  far too many Palestinians have been killed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  That's about as critical as Blinken has been publicly of Israel since the Biden administration [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=48.84s)]
*  has provided weapons in support to Israel after terrorist attacks last month. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=53.32s)]
*  That dissent cable accuses President Biden of spreading misinformation in his speech [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=57.84s)]
*  last month when he declared that Israel has a duty to respond to the vicious terrorist [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=62.68s)]
*  attacks. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=68.08s)]
*  It accuses the administration of failing to reassess American policy towards Israel as [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=69.16s)]
*  it doubled down on unwavering support of Israel's military. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=73.22s)]
*  Now, these dissent cables are a longstanding way for the tens of thousands of State Department [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=76.76s)]
*  employees to raise concerns about U.S. foreign policy. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=81.8s)]
*  The department refuses to comment on specific cables like this one, though supports its [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  employees using it to object. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=89.6s)]
*  We expect people in our workforce to have different personal beliefs, different beliefs [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=93.12s)]
*  about what U.S. foreign policy should be. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=100.24s)]
*  And in fact, we think that that is one of the strengths of this government. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=104.12s)]
*  Now this Axios report says a junior diplomat organized this cable. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=109.64s)]
*  The same person, according to Axios, also posted on social media that Biden was being [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=113.36s)]
*  complicit in genocide. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=117.36s)]
*  Mike? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=119.28s)]
*  Rich Edson live at the State Department. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=120.28s)]
*  Rich, many thanks. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=122.08000000000001s)]
*  Dana? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DeqvkIuf0YM&t=124.08000000000001s)]
