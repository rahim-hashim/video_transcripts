# Middle East is ‘on fire’ because of Biden-Harris ‘incompetence’: Brig. Gen. Tata
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM)
*  All right, let's bring in General Anthony Tata, U.S. Army Brigadier General. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=0.0s)]
*  General, thanks for being here. What's your take on the scope of these attacks by Israel [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=3.36s)]
*  and what they mean about where this goes? Yeah, hey Pete, good morning. Good morning, team. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  You know, the first thing I'd like to say, with President Trump, we had maximum pressure in the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=14.96s)]
*  Abraham Accords, and now with Harris and Biden, we have maximum chaos. And what you've had for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=20.0s)]
*  the last three years is this just a full pedal to the metal against Israel from all these Shia [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=27.12s)]
*  militia groups and Iran. And now Iran has struck back in a very precise way military targets. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=35.92s)]
*  And I don't know if they made a trade with the United States or if they were pressured by the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=43.04s)]
*  United States not to go after the oil infrastructure and the nuclear infrastructure. Perhaps that's the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=48.08s)]
*  next round of attacks if Iran escalates. But what we've got right now is Israel demonstrating [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=53.92s)]
*  that the F-35s and its capabilities can defeat the S-400 Russian air defense systems that [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=62.08s)]
*  Russia provided to Iran. And it's a serious situation. And the whole region is on fire [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=70.8s)]
*  right now because of the Harris-Biden incompetence. Yeah, I think that that's very clear, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=79.12s)]
*  General. And I love the way you laid out how things were under Trump with regard to this situation [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=84.4s)]
*  and that we're basically now sitting on a tinderbox. I think it's also interesting that, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=91.12s)]
*  you know, as Kamala Harris in her last weeks is saying, Trump is Hitler, in the last weeks I'm [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=95.2s)]
*  hearing more and more from Trump and his team, including RFK Jr., saying, if you don't want World [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=100.0s)]
*  War III, you should vote for Donald Trump and making this distinction between a party that is [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=105.92s)]
*  for war and a party that seeks peace. Right, right, Rachel. Think about what Trump did for Israel. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=111.52s)]
*  You know, moved the capital to Jerusalem, has been a staunch supporter of the Israeli people, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  has called for peace throughout the region and did and put his, you know, put money where the mouth [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=127.6s)]
*  is with the Abraham Accords and sending the diplomats over there and bridging this [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=134.48s)]
*  centuries-old hate and economic, building economic ties between significant country, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=140.56s)]
*  Islamic countries. That was, you know, I was part of that when I performed the duties as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  undersecretary for policy. And that was groundbreaking. And it was really promising [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=153.6s)]
*  to have this new hope building in the region, all led by President Trump and Jared Kushner and that [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=160.96s)]
*  team. It was just unbelievable progress. And it was all undone by Harris and Biden on day one when [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=167.44s)]
*  they came in and the rather incompetent national security team that they've got in place. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=174.32000000000002s)]
*  Yeah. All right. Well, General Anthony Tated, thanks for joining us this morning on this big news. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o53cmSWOaTM&t=181.28s)]
