# This is another strategic failure by the Biden admin: Don Bolduc
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA)
*  Our next guest is all about fighting terror firsthand. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=0.0s)]
*  Retired Brigadier General Don Bullock served 10 tours in Afghanistan and he joins us right [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=3.0s)]
*  now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=8.24s)]
*  General, good morning to you. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=9.24s)]
*  Good morning, sir. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=10.24s)]
*  How are you today? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=11.24s)]
*  I'm doing great. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=12.24s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us on this Monday. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=13.24s)]
*  General, will you explain to folks, so we know that the people who are shooting at us, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=15.24s)]
*  U.S. assets over in the region, are backed by Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=21.68s)]
*  Why are they shooting at us? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=26.36s)]
*  The Houthi rebels, what are they trying to do? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Because it looks like they're trying to provoke us into doing something bigger. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=29.88s)]
*  Well, I think the reason that they're attacking us is because they can. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=35.44s)]
*  We have a strategic failure. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=41.32s)]
*  We have a national security B team in place that left Afghanistan with a huge debacle, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=44.48s)]
*  that it waffles on every single strategic issue and doesn't attack the root cause of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=54.6s)]
*  the problem, which in this case is Iran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=60.88s)]
*  And we're allowing them with our policies to pretty much do whatever they want in managing [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=65.04s)]
*  their proxies, Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis in that region, and what, over 75 times now [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=69.68s)]
*  attack U.S. soldiers at the tactical level without any strategic reprisals. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=76.72s)]
*  And it's because the Biden administration is too weak. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=86.16s)]
*  Our diplomacy has no teeth. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=89.88s)]
*  Our national level leaders are not respected or trusted. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=92.7s)]
*  And as a result, they are attacking our men and women on the ground. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=98.12s)]
*  And this is just another failure at the strategic level. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=103.02s)]
*  Listen, they can't drag us into a war. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=107.17999999999999s)]
*  But what they can do is they can continue to attack American service members at sea [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=111.1s)]
*  or on land through their proxies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=117.58s)]
*  And right now they've been allowed to get away with it. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=120.58s)]
*  And I saw this in Afghanistan over 10 tours with the same type of people in this administration, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=123.34s)]
*  in the Obama administration that tied both hands behind our back like they're trying [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=130.16s)]
*  to do with Israel. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=134.42s)]
*  And we become the bad guys when, in fact, the bad guys is Hamas. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=136.42s)]
*  And they need to be pressured, pursued, and punished with every single asset that the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=142.16s)]
*  Israeli have available. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=147.62s)]
*  We need to support them in that effort. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=149.44s)]
*  We need to change the media dialogue outside of your own, mostly the international, that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=151.76s)]
*  Hamas is the bad guys here. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=159.68s)]
*  They're the extremists. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=160.96s)]
*  Hezbollah is the bad guys here. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=161.96s)]
*  The Houthis are the bad guys here. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=163.28s)]
*  Iran is the provocateur. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=165.0s)]
*  And we need to get the international community to put pressure on Iran. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=167.9s)]
*  And they're not doing that, sir. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=173.84s)]
*  General, thank you very much for joining us on this Monday. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=174.84s)]
*  You're very welcome, sir. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=177.88s)]
*  And God bless you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=178.88s)]
*  Happy holidays. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydXAC4jpiaA&t=179.88s)]
