# Houthi rebels fire 2 more bombs on US ships overnight
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs)
*  We have a Fox News alert here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=0.0s)]
*  Iran-backed Tuthi rebels firing two more ballistic missiles at U.S. ships in the Red Sea overnight. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=1.52s)]
*  It's the latest attack after multiple rounds of U.S. airstrikes targeted the group in Yemen. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=7.84s)]
*  Two U.S. Navy steels are still missing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=13.52s)]
*  And former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Biden's failed policies have led to this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=16.48s)]
*  level of aggression we're seeing in the Middle East right now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=20.8s)]
*  Florida congressman and Iraq war veteran Cory Mills joins me now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=24.6s)]
*  Cory, good morning to you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=27.8s)]
*  This situation in the Red Sea with the Houthis, how does it end? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=29.52s)]
*  Well, I can tell you one of the ways that it began was with the Biden administration [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=33.04s)]
*  delisting the Houthis from the foreign terrorist organizations, the FTOs. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=38.0s)]
*  Secondarily, we have to look at what is actually fueling and funding this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=42.6s)]
*  It's the increase in oil exports out of Iran. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=46.88s)]
*  We have loosened the sanctions on Iran. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=49.8s)]
*  We have allowed China to be the largest facilitator in its efforts to try and go ahead and export [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=51.58s)]
*  and import Iranian oil. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=57.2s)]
*  And we're funding with over $10 billion in fungible assets to Iran to continue this increase. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=59.16s)]
*  It's not just the Houthis who are disrupting commerce or making attacks and kinetic elements [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  right there in the Red Sea. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=69.08s)]
*  We're also seeing 100-plus attacks that are occurring in Iraq and also in Syria, which [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=70.34s)]
*  is another element of an Iranian-backed militia, the Qatayib Hezbollah. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=75.08s)]
*  You mentioned the Houthi terror designation and that it was just reinstated to a certain [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=79.16s)]
*  extent. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=84.36s)]
*  There are a lot of questions on if that goes far enough. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=85.36s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=87.72s)]
*  Isn't it true that with this SDGT designation, Houthi operatives or suspected Houthi operatives [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=88.72s)]
*  can apply for visas and travel into the United States? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=96.12s)]
*  I would be veryâ€”so I won't speak to that. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=100.6s)]
*  I would have to get back and check the details. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=103.44s)]
*  But I don't think you should expect that any Houthi operative who applies for a visa [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=105.78s)]
*  to travel into the United States is going to see that visa approved any time in the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=110.24s)]
*  near future, to say the least. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=113.72s)]
*  Get back and check? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=116.28s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=117.84s)]
*  Well, they don't need to actually apply for a visa when we've got open borders that have [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=118.84s)]
*  9-plus million people that are coming across. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=121.68s)]
*  And then when they come across, we're going to give them a phone. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=123.92s)]
*  We're going to go ahead and supplement them with taxpayers' funding. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=125.92s)]
*  We're going to go ahead and give you a court date that you're never going to show up to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=128.16s)]
*  because we're not imposing it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=130.46s)]
*  Look, this is why the battle last night with 107 of us who actually voted no against this [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=131.84s)]
*  continuing resolution is because it doesn't fund the priorities, which is securing our [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=136.36s)]
*  border. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=140.08s)]
*  We care about the American people. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=141.08s)]
*  That is our priorities today. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=143.4s)]
*  We can talk about the Houthi rebels. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=145.28s)]
*  We can talk about failed foreign policy. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=146.56s)]
*  I mean, you had even Secretary Gates of the Obama administration who said that Biden is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=147.88s)]
*  the only person he's ever met that's 100 percent wrong on foreign policy. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  So this is a bigger issue that we have to face. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=155.35999999999999s)]
*  And we have to look at the root cause. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  Stop treating the symptoms without recognizing the disease. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=159.44s)]
*  It's China and Iran. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=161.83999999999997s)]
*  I mentioned those two Navy SEALs who went missing off the Gulf of Aden. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=163.0s)]
*  What happened to them? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=168.76s)]
*  Has Congress been given any information on that? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=169.76s)]
*  We've been given a few little briefs and details, but they're actually still in the rescue, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=171.64s)]
*  and we don't want to release too much at this point. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=174.56s)]
*  That would endanger our recovery efforts. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1txiXlqWVs&t=176.60000000000002s)]
