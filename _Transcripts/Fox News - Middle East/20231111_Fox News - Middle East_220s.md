**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw)
*  to carolyn click right now the former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=0.0s)]
*  idea of ministry captain former netanyahu system for policy [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=2.22s)]
*  advisor and carolyn i can't [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=6.46s)]
*  help but go back maybe i've been obsessing too much on this saudi arabia [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=8.64s)]
*  hosted summit that features ran [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=12.26s)]
*  for the first time eleven years a ran quickly seized on the p r gained from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=14.82s)]
*  that [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  to say they're all in agreement [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=19.26s)]
*  but they're not all in agreement so what do you make of it [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=21.16s)]
*  i think that in the end of the old [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=24.94s)]
*  look there isn't any agreement in the arab league among the arab leaders and [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=26.96s)]
*  certainly not among the sadists and the iranians but uh... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  iran of course wants to present a united front against israel [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=34.6s)]
*  and to a certain degree this uh... meeting of arab leaders [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=38.6s)]
*  uh... is [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=42.96s)]
*  a show force at iran once even though you do hear disparate voices like that [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=44.040000000000006s)]
*  of uh... crown prince muhammad bin salman who says that the hostages need [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=48.28s)]
*  to be returned [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=51.8s)]
*  uh... when he says that uh... the the expectation [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=52.92s)]
*  is that that the raids and the attack lines in the strikes stop [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=56.88s)]
*  is is he getting ahead of himself [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  uh... look i i think that the call for ceasefire is very much getting ahead of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=65.62s)]
*  yourselves you know we have military objectives we have to obliterate hummus [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  after what they did to us just five weeks ago [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=72.92s)]
*  there's no way that we can coexist with hummus after what happened that's very [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=75.48s)]
*  very clear it can continue to exist as an entity [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=79.08s)]
*  uh... if uh... we want to live in security and really want to continue to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=82.2s)]
*  survive here in israel because we see what happens they continue to rebuild [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=85.36s)]
*  reconstitute their power after every round of previous warfare [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=89.08s)]
*  thanks to the international community that sends them billions and billions [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=93.4s)]
*  of dollars first and foremost qatar and iran [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=96.52s)]
*  but uh... we can't allow this to continue hummus has to go [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=99.62s)]
*  and so no matter what happens at the end of the day [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=103.46000000000001s)]
*  israel isn't going to be able to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=106.18s)]
*  give up on that goal because it's it's become a war for our survival that's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=109.08s)]
*  what we saw very clearly on october seventh and there's no way that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=113.28s)]
*  we can stop with anything short of for achieving that goal [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=116.48s)]
*  you know uh... [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=119.74s)]
*  carolina i i i i i know you get this question a lot and and are after your [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=120.96000000000001s)]
*  thoughts on it but [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=126.04s)]
*  when when i keep following these protests going around around the globe [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=127.16s)]
*  uh... pretty much to a protest i don't want to say they're all this way [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=131.6s)]
*  you hear that chant from the river to the sea this is the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=135.24s)]
*  the the wording used to [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=138.8s)]
*  described the rant of these pro [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=142.16s)]
*  palestinian marches [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=145.0s)]
*  regarding israel uh... from the river to the sea [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  is is is not exactly code for wiping out israel [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=150.84s)]
*  but that's exactly what's doing this on my [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=154.4s)]
*  the ignorant of that but i i i but it does even [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=157.08s)]
*  benjamin i was said [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=160.04000000000002s)]

*  so they know full well what they're saying [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=162.8s)]

*  community on planet earth [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=173.56s)]
*  and they're also attacking jews all over the world with that slogan [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=175.42000000000002s)]
*  we see it on university campuses from coast to coast united states we see it [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=179.52s)]
*  in london we see it in paris we see it in brussels [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=183.06s)]
*  so that this is uh... [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=185.88000000000002s)]
*  code not only for the annihilation of the jews of israel but for the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=187.12s)]
*  annihilation of the jews everywhere which is of course what's in hamas' [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=190.0s)]
*  covenant itself [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_s7RZaADJw&t=192.92000000000002s)]
