# More airstrikes in Iraq following strike on Soleimani
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0)
*  Breaking tonight, brand new information on the second round of airstrikes in Iraq. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=0.0s)]
*  Just 24 hours after the top Iranian general, Qasseem Soleimani, was killed in a U.S. drone [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=5.9s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=10.9s)]
*  Fox News correspondent Jillian Turner is following this breaking story for us this evening from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=11.9s)]
*  our Washington bureau. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  Good evening, Jillian. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=17.740000000000002s)]
*  Hi, good evening, Martha. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=18.740000000000002s)]
*  So breaking tonight, an Iraqi official telling the Associated Press an airstrike has hit [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=20.34s)]
*  two vehicles, both carrying Iran-backed militia fighters and killing five people just north [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=25.28s)]
*  of Baghdad. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  Fox News has yet to independently verify this incident. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=32.82s)]
*  Martha, reporting is still very fluid this hour, but as of a few minutes ago, one U.S. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=35.56s)]
*  official now saying it was not a U.S. airstrike. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=40.84s)]
*  This incident comes just a day after the death of Soleimani and the Trump administration, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  now bracing for potential reprisal attacks, including cyber warfare. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  The Iranian regime's had what the U.S. considers to be advanced cyber capabilities for about [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=54.86s)]
*  ten years now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=60.34s)]
*  They've gone after U.S. interests in cyberspace before. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=61.94s)]
*  They maintain the capability to do so again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=65.72s)]
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned about this earlier today. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=68.86s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=72.7s)]
*  There's always risk of cyber attacks. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=74.7s)]
*  Iranians have a deep and complex cyber capability, to be sure. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=76.78s)]
*  Know that we've certainly considered that risk. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=80.8s)]
*  Your point about risk here in the United States is real, too. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=83.26s)]
*  We've reported in the past about Iran's designs on U.S. infrastructure and their ultimate [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=86.94000000000001s)]
*  goal, which is carrying out cyber attacks on the U.S. power grid, banks, and even classified [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=91.34s)]
*  U.S. government computer systems. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=96.98s)]
*  But now lawmakers, both sides of the aisle, Republicans and Democrats, ringing alarm bells [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=99.06s)]
*  about a potential cyber conflict. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=103.98s)]
*  Republicans claim anything Iran can do, the U.S. can do better. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  Well, Iran's got a very sophisticated cyber capability, and so does the United States. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=112.06s)]
*  So the proportionate response, whether it's on in any interest in the Middle East or in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=116.62s)]
*  the cyber domain, needs to be definitive and appropriate. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=121.58s)]
*  Democrats, though, say cyber conflict is now a sure bet. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=127.74s)]
*  We need to have a plan. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=133.22s)]
*  If we are committed to de-escalation, we have to have a plan because a cyber attack is inevitable, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=134.6s)]
*  an attack on an embassy, virtually inevitable. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=139.98s)]
*  Iran's cyber warfare hasn't been limited to the U.S. either. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=143.34s)]
*  Government actors have in the past, Martha, been linked to cyber attacks on Israel, the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=146.89999999999998s)]
*  U.K., and even Turkey. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=151.5s)]
*  Martha? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=153.14s)]
*  Jolene Turner, thank you very much from Washington. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBzBRE_dzC0&t=154.14s)]
