# NEW: Trump calls for Iran's nuclear centrifuges to be blown up
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0)
*  President Trump teasing a big news conference later this morning about what he calls a major [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=0.0s)]
*  trade deal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Doug Luzator joining us live now from Washington. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  Good morning, Doug. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=8.96s)]
*  Good morning, guys. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=10.64s)]
*  For a while now, the White House has said that negotiators were closing in on a number [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=11.64s)]
*  of trade deals, and it looks like this morning they're going to take the wraps off the very [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=15.72s)]
*  first one. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  There are a number of reports now that this deal is with the UK. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  The president will not confirm that, but here's what he posted on Truth Social last [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=25.240000000000002s)]
*  night. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=29.84s)]
*  Big news conference tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=30.84s)]
*  The Oval Office concerning a major trade deal with representatives of a big and highly respected [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=33.92s)]
*  country, the first of many. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=39.44s)]
*  Now at the same time, the administration is moving ahead with talks with China over the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=41.76s)]
*  weekend, trade talks, but don't look for the massive tariffs on that country's goods to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=46.32s)]
*  come down while these talks move forward. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=50.84s)]
*  Are you open to pulling back your tariffs in order to get China to the negotiating table? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=54.54s)]
*  No. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=58.32s)]
*  What do you think they need to do on Fentanyl specifically? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=59.8s)]
*  What do you want to see them do? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=60.8s)]
*  Well, they have to stop Fentanyl from coming in. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=61.8s)]
*  That'll be a very big part. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=64.0s)]
*  And I had that understanding with President Xi before I left last time, and we had a deal, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=65.92s)]
*  and he would have honored the deal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=71.28s)]
*  But when Biden came in, of course, nothing ever happened. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=72.88s)]
*  And while trade talks move ahead with China, the administration is holding out hope for [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=76.52s)]
*  a nuclear deal with Iran. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=80.48s)]
*  We think that there is a deal here that would reintegrate Iran into the global economy, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=83.84s)]
*  that would be really good for the Iranian people, but would result in the complete cessation [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=88.96s)]
*  of any chance that they could get a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=94.03999999999999s)]
*  And that's what we're negotiating towards. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=96.08s)]
*  OK, but something Iran won't be happy about. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  We expect President Trump to rename the Persian Gulf to the Arabian Gulf in coming days. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=101.6s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister says that reflects what he called hostile intent. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=108.08s)]
*  Griffin Carley. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  All right, Doug Lazator live for us in Washington. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=113.83999999999999s)]
*  Doug, thank you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  I'm with the National Security and Military Analyst, Dr. Rebecca Grant. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=117.84s)]
*  Dr. Grant, good morning to you. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  A lot of news this morning on the Iran front. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Let's first start with these two comments that President Trump made yesterday. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=128.12s)]
*  I would much prefer a strong, verified deal where we actually blow them up. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=130.16s)]
*  But blow them up or just denuke them. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=135.32s)]
*  Is it the U.S. position that Iran can have an enrichment program as long as it doesn't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=138.36s)]
*  reach a weapon front? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=142.16s)]
*  We haven't made that decision yet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  We will, but we haven't made that decision yet. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=145.32s)]
*  Yeah, and when he says blow them up, he meant the nuclear centrifuges. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=148.23999999999998s)]
*  But sort of two opposing ideas from the president there in the second clip, he was talking about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  how he hadn't yet made a decision on if Iran could have a civilian nuclear program. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=157.35999999999999s)]
*  So where does that leave us this morning? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=162.12s)]
*  Well, clearly we are deep into these talks with possibly another round in Oman. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=164.24s)]
*  But President Trump is 100 percent right. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=170.12s)]
*  Iran can either negotiate, give up their enriched uranium, or have their nuclear facilities [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=172.52s)]
*  blown up one way or another. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=177.72s)]
*  Cyber, bombers, whatever it takes. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=180.44s)]
*  And I think when he talks about whether they'll have civilian enrichment, you know, they have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=183.08s)]
*  a power plant. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=187.84s)]
*  You can buy fuel for that on the open global market. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=189.28s)]
*  So they are really into the nitty gritty, and I think they've made big progress in getting [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=193.56s)]
*  that nuclear fuel out of Iran. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=198.84s)]
*  And then the incentive, taking off some of the sanctions or letting Iran back into the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=202.24s)]
*  global economy, that's what's driving this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=206.84s)]
*  OK, so Rebecca, also take a look at this. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=209.28s)]
*  In less than seven days, Iran could have one nuclear weapon. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=211.76000000000002s)]
*  In four months, they could have 17. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=216.56s)]
*  So that means that they have figured out the process and are just choosing not to pull [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=219.34s)]
*  the trigger. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=224.56s)]
*  So why, and what does that mean if a deal is made now? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=225.8s)]
*  What does that mean for the potential for a nuclear armed Iran in the future? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=229.48s)]
*  So that means, Carly, and you're exactly right, that they have to take the 60 percent enriched [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=235.6s)]
*  uranium, that's the stock that can be rapidly enriched up to 90 percent, and then a little [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=242.0s)]
*  while to put it into a bomb. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=248.0s)]
*  That has got to go out of Iran. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=249.72s)]
*  Someone has to come literally pick it up, take it away, the Russians, somebody, so that [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=252.16s)]
*  it goes into a place that they cannot have it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=256.32s)]
*  They also can't have the centrifuges. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=259.3s)]
*  And over top of all this, the UN, Rafael Grossi, the inspectors have to be able to look at [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=261.26s)]
*  every inch of all of those Iranian facilities. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=267.7s)]
*  And they've got to do something about the ballistic missiles. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=274.18s)]
*  So Doug just mentioned this at the end of his report, that President Trump is reportedly [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=275.5s)]
*  going to rename the Persian Gulf the Arabian Gulf ahead of his Middle East trip next week. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=278.46000000000004s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=285.26s)]
*  Because Iran certainly doesn't like this idea. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=286.26s)]
*  Oh, I love this because that's what our friends in the region, like the UAE, who's only 32 [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=289.34s)]
*  miles from Iran, they already call it the Arabian Gulf versus catering to Iran with [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=296.06s)]
*  that Persian Gulf. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=301.74s)]
*  And I think this is Iran just putting a little bit more pressure and reminding President [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=303.9s)]
*  Peshishtan that he has got to give in on a lot of key points. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  OK, so the UAE maps already say the Persian Gulf noted. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=312.97999999999996s)]
*  So we would just have to update ours as well. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=317.7s)]
*  Finally, let's get to this really quickly. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=320.06s)]
*  Vice President J.D. Vance's comments on Russia regarding the ceasefire talks. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=322.26s)]
*  This is where he stands right now on this watch. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=327.62s)]
*  We think they're asking for too much. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=330.7s)]
*  OK, if cool heads prevail here, we can bring this thing to a durable peace that will be [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=333.14s)]
*  economically beneficial for both the Ukrainians and the Russians and most importantly, will [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=338.82s)]
*  stop the end of the of the destruction of human lives. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=343.58s)]
*  So the Trump administration now says that Russia is asking for too much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=347.5s)]
*  Your reaction to that? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=350.54s)]
*  So we're all frustrated, but I'm encouraged by Vance's remarks because it means they are [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=353.06s)]
*  really deep into the deal with Russia. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=359.62s)]
*  Guarantee you, Vance also said, you know, economic. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=363.66s)]
*  There are huge economic incentives for Russia with their very weak economy, very dependent [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=367.38s)]
*  on China. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=373.14s)]
*  Those are being laid on the table in the background to try to get Putin to agree to stop fighting [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=374.62s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=380.62s)]
*  That's what it's going to take. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=381.62s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=382.62s)]
*  And more talks to come with Iran, Russia and Ukraine. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=383.62s)]
*  So Dr. Grant, thank you so much for following it all for us this morning. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kevYhW_U7R0&t=385.82s)]
