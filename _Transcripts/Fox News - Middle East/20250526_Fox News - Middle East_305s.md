# GOP rep warns US needs to ensure Iran doesnâ€™t become a nuclear-armed nation
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes)
*  President Trump saying his administration has made further progress in talks with Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=0.0s)]
*  over the weekend as the U.S. tries to curb Tehran's nuclear program. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=5.2s)]
*  Having to deal with nuclear, we've had some very, very good talks with Iran. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=10.56s)]
*  And I don't know if I'll be telling you anything good or bad over the next two days, but I [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=15.26s)]
*  have a feeling I might be telling you something good. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=20.36s)]
*  We've had some real progress, serious progress. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=22.84s)]
*  Georgia Congressman Rich McCormick joins me now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=27.64s)]
*  Congressman, this all comes after the Ayatollah said last week that talks with the U.S. will [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  not bring results. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=34.760000000000005s)]
*  So obviously, it doesn't seem like we're all on the same page here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=36.0s)]
*  Are you optimistic that a nuclear deal gets done? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, I would love to say yes, but these guys have proven time and time again that they [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=42.6s)]
*  love to export terrorism. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=47.44s)]
*  They love to export their weapons across the world to our enemies. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=49.6s)]
*  Their weapons have been used to kill U.S. troops abroad. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=53.8s)]
*  These guys are not good. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=57.56s)]
*  They'll lie at the top of a hat. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=58.56s)]
*  We've had many agreements with them in the past. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=59.96s)]
*  They've reneged on. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  If you want to say trust but verify, I don't even trust them. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  But we always need to make sure they have transparency and we need to make sure they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=67.28s)]
*  do not become a nuclear-armed nation because they have threatened the very existence of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=70.12s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=75.88s)]
*  They believe that Israel is the little Satan, but guess who the big Satan is? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=76.88s)]
*  That's us, the United States of America. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=80.68s)]
*  They're not to be trusted at all. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=82.76s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=84.28s)]
*  So, I think that President Trump is optimistic something happens this week and this week [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=85.28s)]
*  could be the week that we finally get something after decades, but we will see. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=88.16s)]
*  It means I'm the president. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=92.48s)]
*  It also says he agrees with some Senate amendments to the big, beautiful bill. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=93.48s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=98.16s)]
*  In some cases, those changes maybe are something I'd agree with, to be honest. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=99.16s)]
*  I think the Senate is going to get there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=104.12s)]
*  I hope they're going to get there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=105.96000000000001s)]
*  I think they're going to have changes. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=107.44s)]
*  Some will be minor and some will be fairly significant, but we've been working with the [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=109.2s)]
*  House all the way up. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=114.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=116.36s)]
*  You House Republicans had a heck of a time trying to pass this before the Senate got [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=117.36s)]
*  their hands on it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=121.32s)]
*  What happens when the Senate starts really slashing a lot of stuff? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=122.56s)]
*  I'm actually pretty excited about it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=127.16s)]
*  I was one of the 32 that wrote a very stern letter to the leadership saying we have to [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=128.48s)]
*  draw a line and saying we have to be very serious about this debt because it is going [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=133.24s)]
*  to overwhelm our country. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=136.92s)]
*  I'm glad that the Senate's going to have to cut this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=138.8s)]
*  This salt agreement that's going to add $385 billion to our deficit spending, putting us [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=141.44s)]
*  up about $415 billion total, more deficit spending than we did this last year. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=149.24s)]
*  We can't afford that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=154.98s)]
*  We can't afford to have over a trillion dollars per 100 days added to our debt. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=155.98s)]
*  That's on our children. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  We are not built for that. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=161.07999999999998s)]
*  I'm glad the Senate's taking this seriously. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  They're going to get rid of a lot of IRA provisions. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=163.32s)]
*  They need to do that to keep us responsible. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=167.0s)]
*  I'm glad they're going to do it. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=168.96s)]
*  Here's Rand Paul also calling out the bill over the weekend. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=170.44s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=173.04s)]
*  I support spending cuts. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=174.04s)]
*  I think the cuts currently in the bill are wimpy and anemic, but I still would support [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=176.2s)]
*  the bill even with wimpy and anemic cuts if they weren't going to explode the debt. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=180.44s)]
*  The problem is the math doesn't add up. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=185.0s)]
*  They're going to explode the debt by the House says $4 trillion. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=187.56s)]
*  The Senate's actually been talking about exploding the debt $5 trillion. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=190.6s)]
*  And Rand Paul's real issue is raising the debt ceiling. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=194.48s)]
*  So with all this in mind, I mean, you seem like you're pretty negative on it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=196.88s)]
*  He's obviously negative on it. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=200.0s)]
*  What happens in the end? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=202.02s)]
*  What ultimately does the president end up signing? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=203.4s)]
*  I think it's going to be a win regardless. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=207.32s)]
*  No matter what, we're going to start bending the curve. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=209.44s)]
*  That's really important. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=211.68s)]
*  But I think having the Senate on board, taking this very seriously, making sure that we're [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=212.68s)]
*  fiscally accountable, at least getting started on becoming accountable. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=217.08s)]
*  I don't want to hear what we're going to do in four years. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=220.88s)]
*  We're going to have two new Congresses and a new president in four years. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=222.6s)]
*  Let's talk about what we do this year. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=225.68s)]
*  It's about time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=227.28s)]
*  We have control. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=228.44s)]
*  Let's do the right thing for the American public and our future. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=229.72s)]
*  Finally, before we let you go today, of course, is Memorial Day. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  You are a veteran who served in the Marine Corps. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=235.16s)]
*  When you think back to those you served with that are no longer with us because they made [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=238.6s)]
*  the ultimate sacrifice, what goes through your mind on a day like today? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=243.78s)]
*  I was reflecting. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=248.44s)]
*  I just know I was coming on the show and knowing we'd talk about it. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=249.44s)]
*  I'll be talking to a large group this morning. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=251.6s)]
*  When I reflect on my friends that have gone and the sacrifice they made and what their [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=254.52s)]
*  motivation was, the one thing that's unique about the United States from its founding [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=259.4s)]
*  days and makes it different from all other nations, when we sacrifice ourselves, whether [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=263.96s)]
*  it be the Battle of Trenton or Afghanistan or anything in between, we did it for a people [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=268.35999999999996s)]
*  so that the government would be protecting our rights, our rights to life, liberty and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=275.23999999999995s)]
*  the pursuit of happiness, not to lord over us, not to regulate us, not to give us everything, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=280.47999999999996s)]
*  but to give us a chance as self-determination and opportunity that exists nowhere else in [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=285.06s)]
*  the world because the way that we designed our government, which is unique amongst all [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=289.78000000000003s)]
*  governments, and we want to protect that. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=294.74s)]
*  Congressman Rich McCormick, thank you for your service. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=297.42s)]
*  We remember those that you served with that are no longer with us on this Memorial Day. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=300.54s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yGQL6A2iTes&t=304.3s)]
