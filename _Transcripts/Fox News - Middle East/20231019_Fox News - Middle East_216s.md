# Drone warfare will become more 'regular,' expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI)
*  US military bases in the Middle East coming under attack. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=0.0s)]
*  Three drones targeted two different US air bases in Iraq and we are seeing unverified [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  reports this morning that our bases may be taking incoming fire in Syria. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=11.68s)]
*  We're working to confirm that. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=16.4s)]
*  The situation could be growing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=17.6s)]
*  Brett Velikovitch is a former Special Operations Intel analyst and drone expert. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=19.36s)]
*  He's also heading to Tel Aviv next week. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=24.28s)]
*  Brett, good morning to you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  What is your take on the situation, these drone attacks that are targeting US troops? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=28.38s)]
*  Well, Carly, unfortunately, these lethal drone strikes, they're going to get more and more [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=34.66s)]
*  regular as the massive proliferation of drones continues globally. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=39.14s)]
*  You've got these low cost, highly lethal, long distance drones that are becoming more [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=42.739999999999995s)]
*  and more commonplace in these wars and they're no longer just reserved for nation states [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=46.58s)]
*  with government budgets. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=51.26s)]
*  It's nothing for someone who wants to really cause damage to get their hands on this lethal [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=52.379999999999995s)]
*  tech. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  And as a government, they got to wake up and they got to really understand what is [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=56.38s)]
*  going on with the rapid innovation of lethal drone technology and loitering munitions on [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=59.86s)]
*  the front lines of these wars. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=63.940000000000005s)]
*  I don't think we're ready. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=65.36s)]
*  And I worry about the safety of our soldiers and our civilians overseas from future attacks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=66.68s)]
*  I don't think our leadership has a clue how bad it's going to get and more and more people [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=70.14s)]
*  are going to get hurt. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=74.24000000000001s)]
*  I'm sitting right now in Ukraine and there's literally a drone war taking place on both [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  sides of the front lines. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=79.30000000000001s)]
*  thousands of these small, lightweight, fast FPV kamikaze drones that are already proliferating [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=81.66s)]
*  across the front lines. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=87.5s)]
*  We're seeing them show up on other parts of the globe. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=88.78s)]
*  And they've even allegedly created their own production facilities from Iranian specs of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=91.8s)]
*  Iranian made drones. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=95.97999999999999s)]
*  When a $500 drone in the hands of the right skilled pilot can destroy a $1 million tank, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=97.66s)]
*  which we're seeing weekly in Ukraine, we've got a pretty big problem. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=104.3s)]
*  I mean, a little drone just like this is a $500 drone that I don't know if you guys can [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=107.53999999999999s)]
*  see, but something like this can cause massive damage in the right hands. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=112.1s)]
*  And when it comes to the Middle East and these strikes on the U.S. soldiers, you have to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=116.53999999999999s)]
*  understand that this is a region that's been perfecting the art of low cost precision strikes [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=120.33999999999999s)]
*  with drones for years as a result of Iranian covert influence. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=124.32s)]
*  Iran's been supplying Hezbollah, Hamas groups in Syria, other terrorist groups in the region [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=127.94s)]
*  that are using the sophisticated drone technology to inflict harm on Western interests. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=132.5s)]
*  And so we're going to see this major shift in this lethal technology for years to come. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=137.74s)]
*  Yeah, that literally looked like a toy that you just showed on the screen, but it is certainly [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=140.86s)]
*  not one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=143.9s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=144.9s)]
*  How can these attacks on U.S. air bases in Iraq be considered anything other than an [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=146.22s)]
*  attack on the U.S. by Iran? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=152.02s)]
*  To me, I don't see anything other than that. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=153.9s)]
*  Forty-five seconds to you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=157.46s)]
*  No, you're absolutely right. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=158.46s)]
*  I mean, Iran has got their hands on a lot of different conflicts around the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=159.62s)]
*  You don't see them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=164.58s)]
*  They're doing a lot of stuff covertly. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=165.58s)]
*  I mean, let's take Israel, for instance. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=166.58s)]
*  They're still denying this involvement, but the scale and sophistication of Hamas' movement [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=168.70000000000002s)]
*  into Israel, it couldn't have happened without their help. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=172.20000000000002s)]
*  They're a key backer of Hezbollah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=174.88s)]
*  They're a key backer of Hamas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=176.14000000000001s)]
*  They're a key backer of Houthis. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  There are all these groups around the world that are designed to conduct strikes against [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=178.86s)]
*  American interests. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=183.54000000000002s)]
*  And I think we're going to see this because they provide financial support, intelligence, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=184.54000000000002s)]
*  military equipment. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=188.02s)]
*  And it definitely doesn't help that our administration provided them with billions of dollars in [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=189.58s)]
*  funding to just continue this proliferation of their terrorism around the world. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=193.06s)]
*  Yeah, and Vladimir Putin apparently supports Hamas and likes the attack that they inflicted [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=197.5s)]
*  on Israel because he thinks that it's going to distract the United States from the war [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=202.70000000000002s)]
*  in Ukraine as well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=207.06s)]
*  So it is all connected. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=208.06s)]
*  Brett, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=209.06s)]
*  And best of luck when you land in Tel Aviv. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=212.18s)]
*  We appreciate you. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=213.86s)]
*  Safe travels, sir. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxIc4jED7aI&t=214.86s)]
