# Iran’s goal is to dominate, control Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw)
*  I do want to let you know that the official U.S. position on this is to help and provide [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=0.0s)]
*  any help that Israel needs. That does not necessarily mean ground troops, even though [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=4.4s)]
*  we have beefed up our presence with about 900 troops, largely in Syria to address Iranian [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=8.88s)]
*  proxy attacks on U.S. soldiers. I want to go to General Jack Keene, what he makes of that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=14.48s)]
*  General, our position has been, and I think this was coming from a U.S. military spokesman [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  quoting here, what happens in Gaza is purely an Israeli decision. What do you make of that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=25.439999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think that's true. I mean, obviously Hamas conducted a savage brutal attack on Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=36.08s)]
*  I think it has the fingerprints of Iran all over it, quite frankly. It's now reported that the Hamas [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  500 of them were at the IRGC training center in Iran in September. And the hostage taking, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=49.6s)]
*  I think, is a reflection of the playbook from Iran, not something Hamas did in the past on any scale. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=56.96s)]
*  The use of motorcycles, something Iran taught them how to do, as well as the motorized gliders [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=63.52s)]
*  that they were using, reflecting a certain amount of imagination. But this is certainly up to the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=71.44s)]
*  Israelis what takes place in Gaza. But we've got to recognize, and this is where I disagree with [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=77.6s)]
*  the administration, this is all about Iran's strategic objectives, Neil. They've announced [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=82.24s)]
*  these objectives since they took over Iran in the 1980s, and they're very upfront about it. And that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  is to dominate and control the Middle East and take control of the flow of the Persian Gulf oil. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  And then they further state that to accomplish those objectives, and this is something they say [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=103.28s)]
*  annually, to accomplish those objectives we must do two things. Drive the United States military [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=108.16s)]
*  out of the region, thus the attacks that you just referenced, and destroy the state of Israel. And [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  they have Hezbollah and Hamas and Houthis all involved in these activities. It's all related [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=121.04s)]
*  to the same strategic objectives. So to try to parse them and say, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=128.0s)]
*  what is happening in Gaza with Israel is one thing, but what is happening with Iran attacking U.S. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=132.96s)]
*  facilities is quite something else. No, this is all part of their strategic objective. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=139.84s)]
*  You know, General, we're told, I don't know where things stand at this very second, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=147.76s)]
*  that internet service was cut off throughout the Gaza. Then there's this development concerning [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=152.24s)]
*  Elon Musk, which he's—and I hope I'm getting this right, so I don't want to misrepresent it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=157.84s)]
*  He has said that his company would support connecting to internationally recognized aid [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=162.56s)]
*  organizations in Gaza, that he feels that it's crucial that that access, the internet and [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=168.56s)]
*  communication there, to allow aid to come in and some to get out, to happen. But others have [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=174.0s)]
*  interpreted that as maybe spoiling or roiling the Israeli objective here, to go in and attack. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=182.72s)]
*  Well, I think that's a gesture that's trying to facilitate something, getting the aid in and also [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=193.2s)]
*  helping to get people moved out of where the main effort is going to take place. And I think, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=199.68s)]
*  frankly, why hasn't these attacks occurred? Why haven't we seen the main effort? I think it's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=206.4s)]
*  the Israelis, one, making certain that aid is getting in there, and two, I think they're very [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=212.08s)]
*  concerned about the civilian population in the area of the main effort moving to the south. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's really frustrating the fact that Egypt hasn't opened the floodgates and let the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=224.96s)]
*  people out of Gaza. I mean, it's outrageous behavior on the part of the Egyptians. He has two concerns. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=230.0s)]
*  His economy's in the tank. He doesn't want to finance it, too. He's worried about Hamas [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=236.24s)]
*  penetrating into the Sinai because he already has ISIS there. But listen, with security, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=241.6s)]
*  modern security methods, biometrics, the rest of it, his own security people, if he needed help with [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=248.0s)]
*  that, other nations would do it to solve that problem in those refugee camps. Secondly, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=253.28s)]
*  the Arabs can finance it, and they should be financing it. Get these people out of Gaza, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=258.96s)]
*  and I hope the United States is pushing hard to do that. It's outrageous that hasn't happened by [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=264.88s)]
*  now. If MAS wants to help in providing some kind of internet connection so it would assist them, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=269.84s)]
*  I think that's probably okay. The Israelis know what they're doing when they conduct their main [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=278.0s)]
*  effort. They're conducting a lot of shaping operations now, setting the conditions for it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=283.03999999999996s)]
*  That's what you've been seeing here, all against actionable intelligence. In other words, they have [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  a specific target. They're going after it with a bomb, or they're going after it with a raid of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=292.0s)]
*  ground forces. But anything I think that will help the people get out of the way of this [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=297.36s)]
*  ground force and air bombing that's taking place is something everyone is interested in. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=304.72s)]
*  There are reports that Hamas is not making it easy for them to get out of harm's way. That's [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=311.6s)]
*  a separate story. But speaking of Hamas, we've been seeing these protests going on as we speak, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=316.16s)]
*  General, in Istanbul, in London, in New York City last night at Grand Central Station, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=321.36s)]
*  in support of Palestinians, some bold enough to say these are Hamas rallies, in support of Hamas. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=327.44s)]
*  That's happening everywhere. Turkey, it doesn't shock me, but tens of thousands who gather there. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=334.72s)]
*  What do you make of it? Yeah, well, I mean, I understand the emotions involved here, certainly, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=340.40000000000003s)]
*  and the suffering of the Palestinians that have taken place for a number of years. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=347.44s)]
*  But there's a lot of ignorance here in terms of why that is. When you think about it, Neil, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=351.52s)]
*  why are the Arab nations willing to normalize relations with Israel despite what is going on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=356.8s)]
*  with the Palestinians? In other words, why are they going to set up their, and do it, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=363.36s)]
*  have done it, set up their embassies in Israel and have these kinds of relationships despite [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=368.08s)]
*  what's happening with the Palestinians? One, because they don't agree with Hamas. Hamas will [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=375.04s)]
*  not recognize Israel and wants to destroy it. There's not an Arab nation there that agrees [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=379.76s)]
*  with that. They want to have normal relations with Israel. Two, the nations that are already [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=385.36s)]
*  normalized, no major concessions were made on the part of the Palestinians. Why is that? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=392.72s)]
*  The Arabs made the deal with the Israelis because they are fed up [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=399.20000000000005s)]
*  with the Palestinian leadership. I'm talking about the Fatah in the West Bank now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=403.12s)]
*  Year after year after year, they have rejected one concession after another that the Israelis [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=408.24s)]
*  made, but yet they take the hundreds of millions of dollars of donor money, pocket a lot of that [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=414.64s)]
*  for themselves, do not improve the plight of those citizens in any consequential manner whatsoever. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=420.32s)]
*  And the Arabs are fed up with it. They're not going to say that publicly, but that's what they [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=426.56s)]
*  say privately. And that's why they're willing to make a deal with Israel despite the Palestinian [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=431.2s)]
*  issue, because the number one issue for them is what? It's Iran. It's not the Palestinians, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=437.12s)]
*  which used to be an issue 20 years ago. It's Iran. They are fed up with this kind of fraudulent [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=443.28s)]
*  leadership that the Palestinians have, and they just want the people to get new leadership so [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=449.59999999999997s)]
*  they can make better deals with the movement that exists in the West Bank. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=456.24s)]
*  Gaza is hopeless. None of the Arab nations agree that Hamas' purpose is to destroy the state of [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=460.08s)]
*  Israel. They want relationships with the state of Israel. Yeah, to your point, I think we talked [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=466.64s)]
*  about this earlier, that their contempt for Iran oftentimes exceeds that of Israel for Iran. So [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=473.36s)]
*  we'll watch it closely. General, always good having you on. Thank you and for your service [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z1iA8RhrrDw&t=479.28000000000003s)]
