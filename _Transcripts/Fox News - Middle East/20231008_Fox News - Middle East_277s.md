# This should be of no surprise to the Biden admin: Fmr State Dept. spokesperson
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk)
*  It's really unfathomable, unfathomable. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=0.0s)]
*  And 600, I hope everyone understands, 600 fatalities in Israel proportionally is like [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=5.04s)]
*  having here 20,000 American fatalities, 20,000 people who are being butchered, massacred [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=11.58s)]
*  by these savage terrorists. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=20.84s)]
*  It's our 9-11. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=24.64s)]
*  Per capita comparison made there by Israel's UN ambassador a few moments ago here on Fox [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=27.32s)]
*  and Friends, putting the mass number of murder victims in Israel at 600 so far in the context, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=31.92s)]
*  also revealing it's now hitting home in the most grave way. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=40.32s)]
*  I know that there are dozens, dozens, okay, of Americans, Israeli Americans, who are holding [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  citizenship who are being held hostage now in Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=53.36s)]
*  Dozens? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=57.24s)]
*  Dozens. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=58.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=59.24s)]
*  Former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortegas joins us now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=60.24s)]
*  Morgan, great to have you on the program. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=63.6s)]
*  That statement, which we just heard a few moments ago, at least to those of us here [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=64.92s)]
*  in the studio, felt like, while it shouldn't have been surprising, in fact, I think yesterday [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=69.72s)]
*  I was beginning to wonder how many among the dead are Americans, and that's an open question [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=74.08s)]
*  It does, sort of, even though unsurprising, change the equation, doesn't it? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=79.7s)]
*  Especially for the Biden administration. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=84.62s)]
*  Well, we know that terrorists attacked our best friend, our most loyal partner in the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=87.3s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=92.78s)]
*  We also know this is a rough estimate, Will, but about 200,000 Israelis are Americans, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=93.78s)]
*  so they could be dual citizens, or they could just be Americans living in Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  And so, like you said, should not be a surprise. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=104.88s)]
*  Even on 9-11, when thousands of Americans were killed, there were plenty of people of [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=107.68s)]
*  other nationalities that were in that mix as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=112.72000000000001s)]
*  So, we should have seen an attack on our strongest ally in the Middle East as an attack on us, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=115.92s)]
*  because this is what the perpetrators, the funders, the aiders of Hamas, which is the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=121.72000000000001s)]
*  Islamic Republic of Iran, this is what they say. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=126.24000000000001s)]
*  We just need to listen to what they say. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=129.24s)]
*  They want to wipe the state of Israel off the map. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=130.84s)]
*  When they chant death to Israel, they also chant death to America. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=133.86s)]
*  So, it should be of no surprise to this administration especially that the Islamic Republic of Iran, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=137.46s)]
*  who is actively trying to kill former Trump administration officials in America on American [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=143.42000000000002s)]
*  soil, it should surprise no one that that same regime has plotted to kill Americans [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=150.10000000000002s)]
*  and Israelis in Israeli territory yesterday. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=156.06s)]
*  Morgan, what does the Biden administration do? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=159.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, the optics of American citizens, American passport holders being held hostage [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=161.34s)]
*  inside of Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=167.38s)]
*  You know, Congressman Michael Walz just tweeted in response to that news that Special Operations [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=168.38s)]
*  Command, American Special Operations Command, should be on their way to Israel if that's [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=173.26s)]
*  true. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=176.94s)]
*  Whether or not that's the call to action, Joe Biden, I can't help but think back to [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=177.94s)]
*  the 70s in the Iranian hostage crisis. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=181.78s)]
*  Joe Biden's got to do something if Americans are stuck being held hostage in Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=184.86s)]
*  That is a very eerie and very striking parallel, Will, that you just gave. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=190.34s)]
*  I totally agree with you there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=196.34s)]
*  And we will see what comes of it in terms of if it's just Americans dead or actually [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=198.38000000000002s)]
*  held hostage. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=203.26000000000002s)]
*  Again, mathematically with how small Israel is and how many Americans are there, it's [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=204.26000000000002s)]
*  almost impossible. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=208.3s)]
*  But we'll let the authorities definitively say either way. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=209.3s)]
*  First of all, I would say the strong words yesterday from Biden and some Democrats were [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=213.74s)]
*  nice, but words are not enough. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  They have to get this out of their mind that if they give a strong statement and if they [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=219.82000000000002s)]
*  say the right thing, that that means that they have done the right thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=223.46s)]
*  Saying the right thing and doing the right thing are two different things. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=226.86s)]
*  And so this administration has to admit to themselves that their policy of appeasement [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  towards the Islamic Republic of Iran has been an abject failure and that appeasement policy [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=235.46s)]
*  helped lead the conditions on the ground for what happened yesterday. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=240.54s)]
*  And that is because they haven't enforced sanctions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=244.89999999999998s)]
*  They gave them six billion dollars. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=247.22s)]
*  Iran is billions of dollars richer because this administration did not enforce the sanctions [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  that were on the books. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=252.77999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=253.77999999999997s)]
*  And they gave that money to Hamas. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=254.77999999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry, Morgan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=255.77999999999997s)]
*  I'm up against a hard break. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=256.78s)]
*  But to your point, understanding Iran's role illustrates the failure of this administration. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=257.78s)]
*  Always thank you for your time, Morgan. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=262.86s)]
*  All right, we'll be right back. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=km30WcJrFWk&t=263.86s)]
