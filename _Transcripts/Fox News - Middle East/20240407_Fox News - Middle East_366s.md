# 'UNHINGED': Mike Pompeo slams Biden admin's shifting stance toward Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg)
*  Never again. Well, it did happen again. Six months ago to this day, the terrorists of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas launched their savage and evil assault against Israel. And it will happen again if [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=5.38s)]
*  Hamas is not destroyed. Mike Pompeo, former Secretary of State, Director of the CIA, and [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=11.08s)]
*  Fox News contributor joins us now. Mr. Secretary, good to see you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=17.14s)]
*  Great to be with you, Eric. Thank you. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=22.36s)]
*  What do you make of the Israelis withdrawing from southern Gaza? Do you think this retreat [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=23.96s)]
*  is what John Kirby says it is, rest and refit, or is it because of pressure from the Democrats [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=27.96s)]
*  and President Biden? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=33.6s)]
*  Well, Eric, I don't know the answer to that. I don't know why the Israeli leadership made [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=34.6s)]
*  this decision. They'll have a reason. But I can assure everyone watching this, this [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=40.040000000000006s)]
*  is not over. What happened on October 7th was indeed brutal and barbaric, and as you [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=45.6s)]
*  described it, evil. And Hamas and the infrastructure surrounding it have to be entirely decimated [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  to prevent this from happening again. You know, the Hamas leaders are still running [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=55.04s)]
*  around in the tunnels. They've promised to do October 7th, after October 7th, after October [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=58.56s)]
*  7th. And so tactical decisions about troop deployments are for the Israeli government [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=63.4s)]
*  to make. And I regret, Eric, I regret that the Biden administration is speaking out of [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=67.28s)]
*  both sides of their mouth while they say they're supporting Israel. All of the pressure that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=72.72s)]
*  they're applying today, talking about weapons and conditionalization and all of these things, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=76.52s)]
*  and saying you have to fight this in a way that is more decent and protects civilians [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=81.44000000000001s)]
*  more. That is putting pressure on the Israelis and not on Hamas, and that reduces the chance [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  that these hostages will ever come home. And the fact that President Biden refuses to talk [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  about the fact there's still Americans being held there by Iran, by Hamas, is indecent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=94.64s)]
*  And the policy that the Biden administration has developed has become so unhinged with [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=99.84s)]
*  Secretary Blinken talking about moral equivalence between Israel and Hamas. I just, it's incomprehensible [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=103.68s)]
*  to me, Eric. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=109.72s)]
*  And Secretary, you have the letter from the Democrats, some Democrats including Nancy [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=110.72s)]
*  Pelosi saying there should be an immediate ending of the weapons transfer, pending an [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=114.6s)]
*  investigation of that horrible mistake, of course, the attack on the aid workers. What [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=120.76s)]
*  does that do to Israel? What happens if the arms are ended and our support ends as some [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=126.8s)]
*  of the Democrats are calling for? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=133.12s)]
*  Well, this would make it much more difficult for Israel to prosecute what is not only necessary [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=136.16s)]
*  for them, but important to us, Eric. We can't forget, America has a deep interest in the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=141.0s)]
*  destruction of Hamas. We shouldn't think for a second that the Iranian regime that is training, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=145.68s)]
*  funding them, giving them the capacity that they have today to wreak their terror, is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=150.35999999999999s)]
*  trying to kill Americans, even as we sit here. And so to say, well, we're just going to cut [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=154.64s)]
*  off weapons systems for Israel is dangerous, not only for Israel, but the Gulf Arab states [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=158.64s)]
*  and the United States as well. I pray that America won't make that tragic decision. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=163.24s)]
*  I think Nancy Pelosi and some of the Democrats are playing pure domestic politics on this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=167.4s)]
*  and our support for Israel should be unequivocal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=172.60000000000002s)]
*  They'll fight this war the right way. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=175.52s)]
*  These tragedies that happen in wartime are devastating and heartbreaking to see. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=177.84s)]
*  We shouldn't forget the Biden administration killed 10 innocents as they were trying to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=182.56s)]
*  get after the folks who killed the Americans in Afghanistan. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=186.68s)]
*  Shoot, the Biden administration never even apologized or accepted responsibility as the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=189.4s)]
*  Israelis have. We have to continue to make sure we understand this is evil. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  We are good. Israel is good. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  And we need to make sure that that certainty around who's on which side, who the white hats [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=200.48000000000002s)]
*  are here, is very clear in U.S. policy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=204.64000000000001s)]
*  Do you think those calls, do they help Hamas? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=207.36s)]
*  Do they give a propaganda victory to the Islamic radical terrorists? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=210.36s)]
*  Here's the Prime Minister Netanyahu talking about the international community and that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=214.52s)]
*  very topic. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=218.44000000000003s)]
*  Israel is prepared for a deal. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=221.72000000000003s)]
*  Israel is not prepared to surrender. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=224.16000000000003s)]
*  Instead of the international pressure being directed at Israel, which is only causing [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=226.84s)]
*  Hamas to harden its positions, the pressure of the international community needs to be [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  directed at Hamas. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=236.16000000000003s)]
*  Do you think that there has been a sense of reaching out to Hamas that in some you talk [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=238.28000000000003s)]
*  about the moral equivalence? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=243.08s)]
*  They give Hamas the break and not Israel. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=245.08s)]
*  Eric, 100 percent. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=249.36s)]
*  Every time President Biden talks about putting pressure on Israel, every time he castigates [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=251.60000000000002s)]
*  the Israeli government, every time the international community, I felt like at the UN, this [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=256.32s)]
*  fellow named Martin Griffiths put out the statement yesterday that was just mind boggling, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=260.56s)]
*  naive and anti-Semitic at its core. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=264.2s)]
*  Every time that happens, these leaders, Sanwar and the other Hamas leaders are encouraged. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=268.16s)]
*  The Iranian regime is encouraged. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=271.88s)]
*  And every time the United States says, oh, please, just please stop. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=273.68s)]
*  If you Houthis will stop, we'll designate you as terrorists. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=277.12s)]
*  If you'll stop taking ships off the Red Sea. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=279.84000000000003s)]
*  Every one of those actions is reverberates inside of the decision making process for [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  the world's largest state sponsor of terror in Iran. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=286.92s)]
*  And you talk about Iran, finally, Israel right now bracing for a potential Iranian [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=289.2s)]
*  attack, you know, firsthand, the evil of that regime, assassinations, using their [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=294.12s)]
*  diplomatic corps to kill opponents and other people. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=299.92s)]
*  Of course, you got the bombing of the embassy in 1992 in Buenos Aires, the Israeli [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=304.20000000000005s)]
*  embassy. What about that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=308.48s)]
*  What do you expect from Iran? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=310.76000000000005s)]
*  And what does the US do concerning that? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=312.12s)]
*  Yeah, so, Eric, I don't know what tactical decision they made. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  Clearly, there's some intelligence indicating that there's going to be a strike. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=319.12s)]
*  But we shouldn't forget since October 7th, there have been over 100 attacks on American [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=322.32000000000005s)]
*  interests. Forget Israelis for a moment, on American interest in the Middle East. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=327.44000000000005s)]
*  So the Iranians, this is not new to think, oh, goodness, the Iranians are now going to [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=331.04s)]
*  take a strike. The Iranians through Hezbollah, through the Houthis in Yemen, and of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=334.16s)]
*  course, through Hamas as well, have been active in the region since October 7th. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=338.72s)]
*  I suspect that will continue until the United States actually imposes real costs on [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=342.56s)]
*  the Iranian regime. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=346.84s)]
*  Former Secretary of State, Matt Pompeo, who knows firsthand the issue with Iran and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=348.28s)]
*  the threat that the mullahs in Tehran pose to international peace and security as [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=353.48s)]
*  well as our ally Israel. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=358.72s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, thank you. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=360.64s)]
*  Thank you, Eric. Have a great day. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=363.12s)]
*  You too, Arthur. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vQn-LQmu8qg&t=364.28s)]
