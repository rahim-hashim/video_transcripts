# 'The WHOLE WORLD IS WATCHING' President Trump, says Ben Hall #foxnews #shorts #trump #iran #israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0)
*  Let's go now to Fox News senior correspondent, Benjamin Hall. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=0.0s)]
*  All right, so Benjamin, you've survived wars. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=3.0s)]
*  What does your gut tell you? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=6.8s)]
*  You know, Jesse, it's fascinating to watch this right now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=7.96s)]
*  The whole world is watching what President Trump is about to do. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=10.36s)]
*  And just seeing him standing at the White House earlier on, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=13.4s)]
*  keeping everyone guessing, not making that move too quickly is fascinating. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=16.48s)]
*  Look, I think it's fair to say that there are incredible pros [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=19.92s)]
*  for hitting that nuclear site and incredible cons as well. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=23.52s)]
*  The pros you laid out earlier. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=27.68s)]
*  Look, you get rid of Iran's nuclear facility. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=29.2s)]
*  That...the US is the only country that can do that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=31.52s)]
*  That perhaps leads to a change in regime. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=34.4s)]
*  As you said, the country is falling apart. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=36.96s)]
*  People are striking. People can't afford to live. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=38.96s)]
*  That could change the whole Middle East. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=41.08s)]
*  With President Trump's relationships with Saudi Arabia and Israel, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=43.52s)]
*  if the Iranian regime was to fall, you could change the region. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=46.64s)]
*  You could pull them away from China, pull them away from Russia. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=50.72s)]
*  It could be a geopolitical shock if that would have happened. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=53.68000000000001s)]
*  It would be a seismic change. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=57.48s)]
*  On the other hand, there are potential real negatives. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=59.72s)]
*  And that is down to how Iran will respond. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=63.04s)]
*  Look, if Iran was to go after American embassies, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=65.64s)]
*  American...uh...ships, American bases, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=69.4s)]
*  and Americans were killed, it would quickly lead to escalation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=74.52s)]
*  America would have to get involved further and further. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=77.48s)]
*  If they shut the Straits of Hormuz, the oil prices rise. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=80.03999999999999s)]
*  If they use their countless terror proxies around the world, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=83.32s)]
*  we could see an outbreak. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=86.72s)]
*  So, President Trump right now is balancing the two. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=87.72s)]
*  But even if the US didn't want to get involved with this before Israel started, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=90.64s)]
*  the thinking is that when Iran... [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=95.12s)]
*  if Iran is now given a chance, they will rush for a bomb. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=97.4s)]
*  It is the only way they can do so. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=100.32s)]
*  The delays on their nuclear program at the moment may be around two years. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=102.4s)]
*  It'll be five plus years if that facility is hit. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=106.16s)]
*  And that is a big difference. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  And so, President Trump, muddling this up, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=110.28s)]
*  do you stand alongside your ally, Israel, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=112.76s)]
*  or do you perhaps pull back and hope for some diplomatic way of this finishing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=115.60000000000001s)]
*  That, it appears, is not likely. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=120.4s)]
*  And many people are feeling it won't be long [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=122.48s)]
*  till the president makes the decision to perhaps go after Fordu nuclear base. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GuKIkP6Ks0&t=124.52000000000001s)]
