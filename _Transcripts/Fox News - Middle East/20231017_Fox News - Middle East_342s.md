*  First on this Tuesday morning. I'm Carly Schimkes. And I'm Todd Pyro. President Biden headed [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=21.6s)]
*  to Israel tomorrow as the U.S. readies 2,000 non-combat troops for a potential deployment. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=26.84s)]
*  Relief convoys gathered near the Egypt-Gaza border waiting to deliver food and emergency [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=32.84s)]
*  supplies to the two million civilians in Gaza who badly need it. And on the other side [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=37.84s)]
*  of the fence hundreds of people desperate to get out. Brooke Singman has more on the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=42.84s)]
*  president's visit to the Middle East. Brooke. Hey guys, President Biden will travel to Israel [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=47.84s)]
*  tomorrow where he will meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Now this trip will make [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=52.84s)]
*  him the first head of state to visit Israel since Hamas launched their deadly attacks [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=56.84s)]
*  on October 7th. He'll then head to Jordan to meet with Arab leaders including the Palestinian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=60.84s)]
*  authority president about the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. The White House says the trip [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=65.84s)]
*  will also serve as a warning to other countries in the region not to take advantage of the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=70.84s)]
*  vulnerable situation. Listen. President Biden will underscore our crystal clear message [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=75.84s)]
*  to any actor, state or non-state, trying to take advantage of this crisis to attack Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=80.84s)]
*  Don't. To that end, he's deployed two aircraft carrier groups and other military assets to [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=86.84s)]
*  the region. Despite reports that Biden's visit could delay Israel's ground invasion into [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=93.84s)]
*  Gaza, the IDF says that is not the case with 300,000 Israeli troops remain lined up ready [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=98.84s)]
*  to strike at any time. The president is here to show his support for Israel and that he [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=104.84s)]
*  stands with Israel, our right to defend ourselves. The president also said that Hamas needs to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=111.84s)]
*  be destroyed and that is exactly our military aim. We want to dismantle Hamas and make sure [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=117.84s)]
*  that never again will any terrorist organization in Gaza have the ability to perform the atrocities [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=122.84s)]
*  that Hamas did. This is our military readies to potentially put more boots on the ground in the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=128.84s)]
*  Middle East. More than 2000 troops have been ordered to be on standby for a possible deployment [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=134.84s)]
*  to Israel and a defense official confirming an additional group of 2000 Marines and sailors with [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=139.84s)]
*  the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit are headed towards the Israeli coast. The MEU has been [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=145.84s)]
*  operating in the Middle East before the Hamas attack earlier this month and the group acting as [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=151.84s)]
*  a show of force to deter groups like Iran. As far as we know, the US service members headed towards [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=156.84s)]
*  Israel will provide medical support for Israeli forces, not for combat. Carly, Todd? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=162.84s)]
*  All right, Brooke Singman live for us this morning. Brooke, thank you. And look, you certainly [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=167.84s)]
*  love the president to go overseas and appear presidential, a show of strength, a show of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=171.84s)]
*  American support. But there are a lot of people who are more laser focused on the war effort who [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=177.84s)]
*  are questioning is this the right move at the right time? Is it going to appear that the president [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=182.84s)]
*  is going to try to, I'm not necessarily saying broker a ceasefire, but try to insinuate that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=188.84s)]
*  maybe Israel should do less than it is currently doing. And obviously Israelis don't believe that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=194.84s)]
*  Israelis want to counteract the violence that they've been subjected to over the last week and a half [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=200.84s)]
*  with a show of force that the world has never seen. Yeah, well, if you talk to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=206.84s)]
*  he would not agree with those critics whatsoever because he invited the president to Israel. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=211.84s)]
*  And I think it shows how important this relationship between Israeli and the United States is to send a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=216.84s)]
*  president into a war zone at the start of the war is no small thing. There are so many security factors [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=222.84s)]
*  that play into this as well. So that is a bit of concern. John Kirby was asked about that yesterday or yesterday. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=228.84s)]
*  And he mentioned that it took the president about a year to visit Ukraine and the security situation was [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=235.84s)]
*  much different there with the capital city, Kiev, being bombed. So hopefully this will be much safer. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=243.84s)]
*  And all of those factors obviously play into the president and the Biden administration saying yes to this visit. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=249.84s)]
*  But I mean, if you think about what the United States is doing right now, sending the president to Israel, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=255.84s)]
*  about 2000 troops on standby being told to be ready to be deployed at any moment. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=260.84s)]
*  There's also an additional 2000 Marines and sailors who are already in Kuwait now heading closer to Israel. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=265.84s)]
*  And all of this is deter to deter Iran and show a show of force saying don't even think about escalating the situation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=271.84s)]
*  Yeah, the chronology is definitely fascinating because to your point, you always have the president, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=280.84s)]
*  heads of state visiting places after the fact, after hostilities have really taken hold. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=287.84s)]
*  And here we are still waiting for Israel to begin its counteroffensive there in Gaza. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=293.84s)]
*  And yet, look, the president could be visiting in the next 24 hours. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=298.84s)]
*  There's also one other thing I wanted to mention and it has to do with the hostage situation. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=302.84s)]
*  A spokesperson for Hamas released a statement yesterday saying that Hamas is ready to release non-Israeli hostages [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=306.84s)]
*  once the on-ground conditions permit. So you have to wonder how to read into that situation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=315.84s)]
*  You hear from Trey Yankston and others saying Hamas lies all the time. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=322.84s)]
*  But for them to release that statement, I'm sure gives a lot of people hope this morning that they could see their family members soon. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=326.84s)]
*  Of course, without a doubt hope. But you have to listen to the Trey Yanks and the other experts on the world who say never believe a word that Hamas says. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=331.84s)]
*  That's absolutely right. Yep. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2yVNG7ZzVwo&t=339.84s)]
