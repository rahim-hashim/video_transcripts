# Kayleigh McEnany: This is inexcusable
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc)
*  This hour, the White House had confirmed this new agreement between Israel and Hamas to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=0.0s)]
*  extend a truce, a pause in the fighting situation for more hostages. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=5.88s)]
*  Right now, the White House press briefing is underway. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=11.16s)]
*  You see John Kirby there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=13.3s)]
*  Let's watch together. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=15.14s)]
*  ... extension of the original agreement, as well as efforts to extend the pause even from [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=16.14s)]
*  there. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=20.16s)]
*  Just a quick update on the figures. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=21.92s)]
*  As of the morning of November 26, 200 trucks were dispatched to the Ra'afah crossing and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=23.3s)]
*  137 trucks of supplies were offloaded by the United Nations reception point in Gaza, making [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=29.060000000000002s)]
*  it the biggest humanitarian convoy received since the 7th of October. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=34.66s)]
*  This much-needed relief into Gaza to alleviate the suffering of Palestinian civilians there. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=39.46s)]
*  Of course, most of them have nothing to do with Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=44.38s)]
*  And to date, we have assisted over 840 Americans and their families who have departed in support [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=47.86s)]
*  of our team on the ground in Egypt. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=53.14s)]
*  With that, we'll take some questions. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=54.9s)]
*  Thank you, Admiral. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=57.9s)]
*  A few things here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=58.9s)]
*  The President called conditional aid for Israel a worthwhile thought. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=59.9s)]
*  Is he actually considering conditioning aid or not? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=65.82s)]
*  What he also said, right after acknowledging that it was a worthwhile thought, was that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=70.06s)]
*  the approach he has chosen to take so far has produced results and outcomes. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=74.98s)]
*  I just walked you through in my opening statement. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=80.38s)]
*  So the approach that we're taking with Israel and, quite frankly, with our partners in the [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=83.22s)]
*  region is working. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=87.02s)]
*  It's getting aid into people that need it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=88.58s)]
*  It's getting a pause in the fighting. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=90.66s)]
*  It's getting hostages out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=92.14s)]
*  It's getting Americans out. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=93.34s)]
*  And quite frankly, we continue to urge and will continue to urge the Israelis as they [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=95.38s)]
*  conduct military operations to do so with the utmost care for innocent civilian life. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=99.82s)]
*  So if there are Democrats in his party who say we need to start conditioning aid going [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=104.14s)]
*  forward, what would he say? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=107.66s)]
*  I think he would say exactly what he said to you all yesterday when he got asked this [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=109.26s)]
*  question. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=112.53999999999999s)]
*  It's a worthwhile thought, but the approach that I'm taking now is working. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  The approach that we're taking now is working. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=117.58s)]
*  It's getting results. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=119.5s)]
*  The increasing dangers to U.S. military personnel in the Gulf. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=120.5s)]
*  I know you outlined in a series of appearances this morning what happened. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=124.98s)]
*  But are we to continue seeing this sort of, let me put it this way, is that strategy of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=130.34s)]
*  dealing with it as it happens going to continue to be the strategy? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=138.17999999999998s)]
*  You've seen some say there should perhaps be a more robust response to these ongoing [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=142.98s)]
*  attacks, whether it's from Iranian-backed militias in Syria or Iraq, whether it's the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=148.45999999999998s)]
*  Houthis. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=153.1s)]
*  Is there any thought of changing up how that's done? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=154.1s)]
*  I don't think we're going to get in the business of telegraphing our punches, Ed. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=156.42s)]
*  We've responded forcefully against the threats to our forces in Iraq and Syria, and now our [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=160.01999999999998s)]
*  forces in the Gulf region, the Gulf of Oman, Gulf of Aden, will continue to do that as [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  appropriate. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=172.89999999999998s)]
*  Is striking in Yemen still an option? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=173.89999999999998s)]
*  Again, I'm not going to telegraph punches. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=176.38s)]
*  We will take the steps appropriate to protect our troops and our forces in the Middle East [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  region. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=183.29999999999998s)]
*  I would add that the Mason is attached to the USS Eisenhower carrier strike group, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  which the president dispatched to the region specifically to address the increase in the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=190.1s)]
*  tensions. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=194.77999999999997s)]
*  Any possibility that Americans will be among the 20 that we release in the next few days? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=196.46s)]
*  Well, we certainly hope so. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=200.62s)]
*  I mean, we're going to watch this very, very closely. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=201.62s)]
*  We're certainly hoping that another batch of hostages gets released today as part of [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=203.58s)]
*  the fourth and final day of the original agreement. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=208.1s)]
*  We're going to be watching closely to see if any Americans are in that group. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=211.1s)]
*  As it has come out over the last three days, we don't really know until you get into the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=214.66s)]
*  end game who's going to be actually on that list. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=219.74s)]
*  And then you've got to watch closely to seeing who's on the list as folks that actually come [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=223.06s)]
*  out. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=227.34s)]
*  So we're watching and hoping. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=228.34s)]
*  And you spoke of the president's conversation at a critical moment to break that impasse. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=229.34s)]
*  Can you talk a little more about what that impasse was and how that was broken in his [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=232.34s)]
*  conversations? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=236.38s)]
*  I mean, it was really, it came down to, you're talking about over the weekend, it was really [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=237.38s)]
*  more about the lists and who was on it. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=241.54000000000002s)]
*  And I don't want to get into more detail than that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=245.18s)]
*  It's a similar issue to what we face today. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=247.46s)]
*  There's another reason why there's been a little bit of a delay because there was a [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=251.26s)]
*  difference of a view, if you might, over the list and the fact that mothers were not originally [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=255.7s)]
*  going to be allowed to come out with their children. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=260.98s)]
*  Now that's been resolved. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=263.42s)]
*  So it really had to do with the who. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=264.54s)]
*  And very quickly, the newly elected leader of Argentina says he's coming to the U.S. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=266.9s)]
*  and also to D.C. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=272.7s)]
*  Any meeting status with administration officials? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=273.7s)]
*  Was Pryson with anybody else while he's here? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=276.7s)]
*  Yes, President-elect Malay will be coming to Washington, D.C., largely to meet with [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=279.58s)]
*  the IMF and the World Bank over their fiscal and economic issues. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=284.26s)]
*  But while he's here in town, he'll have a chance to meet with some National Security [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=290.78s)]
*  Council folks, including Jake Sullivan. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=294.1s)]
*  No plans to meet with the president, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=297.5s)]
*  No plans to meet with the president. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=298.5s)]
*  The president will, as you think you know, be on travel in the middle of the week. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=299.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=302.5s)]
*  On the remaining Americans who are being held, do you have any more clarity on whether they're [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=303.5s)]
*  being held by Hamas or with one of these other terrorist groups? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=307.22s)]
*  No. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=310.22s)]
*  And, you know, all along, you've been very clear about concerns that a broader ceasefire [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=311.22s)]
*  would only benefit Hamas. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=315.46000000000004s)]
*  Sullivan was pretty clear yesterday in saying that, you know, Hamas has been able to gain [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=317.06s)]
*  some benefit from this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=320.26000000000005s)]
*  How concerned are you that the longer this truce lasts, now six days, that Hamas will [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=321.82000000000005s)]
*  benefit? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=326.98s)]
*  And how do you weigh that? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=327.98s)]
*  It's a real risk. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=328.98s)]
*  You have to expect a group like Hamas, a terrorist group, which clearly doesn't abide by laws [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=330.54s)]
*  of war. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=335.22s)]
*  They try to take advantage of any pause in the fighting for their own benefit. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=336.22s)]
*  So we're watching that closely as well as our Israeli counterparts. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=339.18s)]
*  You can bet that they're watching that closely. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=342.62s)]
*  But and I don't want to speak for the Israelis, but I mean, this is a calculated risk that [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=345.38000000000005s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu and his war cabinet are willing to take in order to get those [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=351.22s)]
*  hostages out. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=354.3s)]
*  So it's a it's a balance. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=355.3s)]
*  And as you've also heard the Israelis say, that once the pauses are over, they intend [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=357.18s)]
*  to go right back at military operations. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=362.52000000000004s)]
*  And when you say Hamas has been able to get some benefits so far, is that restocking, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=364.74s)]
*  resupplying? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=368.5s)]
*  What is that benefit? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=369.5s)]
*  I would just say that without getting into intelligence issues, that any pause in the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=371.06s)]
*  fighting could benefit your enemy in terms of time to refit, to rest your fighters, to [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=374.46s)]
*  rearm them, re-equip them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=384.18s)]
*  A pause in the fighting can be seen as a benefit. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=388.3s)]
*  But again, I want to stress, and this was always part of the calculus, any discussion [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=392.02s)]
*  of pauses was always part of the calculus that Hamas might try to benefit from it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=396.21999999999997s)]
*  But so too have the Israeli people benefited by the return of their loved ones and hostages. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=401.02s)]
*  So too have the American people benefited now with little Abigail back with her family. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=406.65999999999997s)]
*  So again, it's a balance. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  And again, I won't speak for the Israeli Defense Forces, but when they have when these pauses [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=412.9s)]
*  are over, then they have made it very clear that they're going to continue to target Hamas [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=418.82s)]
*  leadership. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=422.46s)]
*  John, how many Americans are still being held hostage, and do you have proof of life? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=423.46s)]
*  We think the number is, well, it's less than 10, probably in the neighborhood of about [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=428.3s)]
*  eight to nine. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=436.5s)]
*  But we don't necessarily have firm, solid information on each and every one of them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  And why haven't the two American women who are with Abigail? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=444.02s)]
*  What happened with them? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=448.46s)]
*  Why haven't they been released? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=449.46s)]
*  Well, we certainly hope that we'll see them in hopefully today. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=450.46s)]
*  And if not today, certainly over the next couple of days, we want to see them back with [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=455.62s)]
*  their families where they belong as well. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=458.65999999999997s)]
*  The lists are developed by Hamas. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=462.82s)]
*  And then of course, the Israelis developed their list of Palestinian prisoners that they're [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=465.86s)]
*  going to release. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=469.34s)]
*  And we're not involved in the specific drafting of the lists and the determination on Hamas's [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=470.34s)]
*  side of who's going to come out on any given day. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=474.74s)]
*  Obviously, we want to see those two American women released as soon as possible. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=477.53999999999996s)]
*  With the truce being extended two days, what happens now? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=480.7s)]
*  Do you want to get like three days next or a permanent truce? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=484.41999999999996s)]
*  What's the thing? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=488.17999999999995s)]
*  It's like I said in my opening statement, Steve, we're grateful that we've got an extra [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=489.17999999999995s)]
*  two days to work with here. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=492.38s)]
*  That'll result in the release of 20 more individuals, women and children. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=494.38s)]
*  And as I said right at the top, we'd certainly like to see even that extension extended further [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=499.9s)]
*  until all the hostages are released. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=505.94s)]
*  That's really the goal here, get all the hostages home with their families where they belong. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=507.73999999999995s)]
*  And however long that could take. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=511.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=514.34s)]
*  Just to follow up on the question about Millay visiting Washington, you mentioned that most [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=515.34s)]
*  of his meetings would be with the IMF, but who will be meeting at the White House, at [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=521.86s)]
*  the NSC? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=526.78s)]
*  And what are the expectations of the White House for this meeting? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=527.78s)]
*  And more broadly, what are the expectations of the president for the relationship between [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=530.78s)]
*  the two nations? [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=533.78s)]
*  I already answered that question. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=534.86s)]
*  He's going to be, he'll have a chance to meet with Jake Sullivan and potentially other folks [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=535.86s)]
*  here at the NSC. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=540.1s)]
*  We'll have to see how that shakes out. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=541.1s)]
*  President won't unfortunately be able to meet with him because of domestic travel. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=543.62s)]
*  But obviously we want to continue to look for ways to cooperate with Argentina. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=547.42s)]
*  Argentina is a healthy and vibrant partner in this hemisphere on many, many issues. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=555.1s)]
*  We're looking forward to obviously hearing what the president-elect's ideas are and where [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=561.5s)]
*  he wants to go on policy issues and making sure that we have a chance to keep that channel [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=565.18s)]
*  communication open. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=570.18s)]
*  John, I want to go to Africa and the Congo, if you will. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=571.18s)]
*  Updates after the visit from DNI head, National Security of State, and also maybe connecting [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=578.22s)]
*  this with the president's meeting with the president of Angola on trade that deals with [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=586.34s)]
*  the Congo. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=591.0600000000001s)]
*  All right. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=592.0600000000001s)]
*  So you've got John Kirby there talking about what it took to get this deal done between [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=593.0600000000001s)]
*  Israel and Hamas and what the White House is hoping will happen is that they can make good [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=598.1s)]
*  use of the extra two days in a ceasefire. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=602.4200000000001s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=605.0600000000001s)]
*  Qatar in there, and I've got it right here. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=606.86s)]
*  So I want to make sure they called it an ongoing mediation and agreement. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=608.98s)]
*  I actually, it does not say truce in what they say. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=614.26s)]
*  I didn't start seeing that until others started reporting it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=619.98s)]
*  And that nomenclature is important because, and even Kirby acknowledged, any break in [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=623.34s)]
*  fighting allows the enemy to regroup, regain, rearm, so and so. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=628.8199999999999s)]
*  So this is not necessarily a truce. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=635.14s)]
*  They certainly aren't sitting down. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=637.9399999999999s)]
*  And again, they're using the hostages as the leverage to stop this war, and everyone [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=639.94s)]
*  is playing into their hands. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=645.94s)]
*  And look, your heart breaks for these families. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=647.62s)]
*  Your heart breaks for the Israelis who are wondering where their loved ones are. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=651.22s)]
*  At the same time, we've seen this before. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=654.86s)]
*  In 2006, Israel did a swap. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=657.1s)]
*  I think they traded something like what, 2,000 fighters, 1,000 fighters, and they got one [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=659.1400000000001s)]
*  corporal back. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=665.44s)]
*  One of the fighters they released was a guy named Yahya Sinwar. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=666.82s)]
*  He's the man who orchestrated this attack on October 7th. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=670.9000000000001s)]
*  So there is a price to pay, I think, by continuing to play this game of trading lives and treating [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=674.58s)]
*  lives as if it's currency. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=681.48s)]
*  These are precious human lives. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=683.46s)]
*  It's not currency. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=685.0600000000001s)]
*  You know, I hear you say that, and Murray, you and I were talking off camera. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=686.0600000000001s)]
*  I think you leave no one behind. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=689.38s)]
*  I think you do what it takes. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=691.2600000000001s)]
*  And I understand what you're saying. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=693.22s)]
*  But then you say to the rest of the world, we're with Israel. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=695.6999999999999s)]
*  And you go in and you take those scorpions out. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=699.5799999999999s)]
*  You get as many hostages, you have as many ceasefires as you possibly can, because they [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=701.86s)]
*  are rearming. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=707.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=708.06s)]
*  And they have Iranian-backed weapons. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=709.06s)]
*  So you can't just lay down on the ground and do negotiations forever. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=711.3s)]
*  But you reach a point. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=715.9399999999999s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=716.9399999999999s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=717.9399999999999s)]
*  This is how we get these hostages home. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=718.9399999999999s)]
*  I wish there was a perfect option here. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=720.5799999999999s)]
*  There are not in these situations. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=722.68s)]
*  That's why Hamas takes hostages. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=724.32s)]
*  If we want these Israelis, Americans and other people from around the world home, this is [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=726.0400000000001s)]
*  how we do it. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=730.2s)]
*  Let's also be clear that before this ceasefire, this truce, whatever word we're using, Israel [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=731.2s)]
*  did quite a bit of damage to Hamas, backed by American firepower. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=735.12s)]
*  And after this ends, after we get as many hostages out as we can, they're going to do [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=739.36s)]
*  it again. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=743.36s)]
*  So I think, you know, this is how we get these videos we've seen of nine-year-old, you know, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=744.36s)]
*  sons being reunited with their fathers. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  This is it. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=751.32s)]
*  We're a team, negotiating with Qatar behind the scenes, but very powerfully to get people [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=752.32s)]
*  out. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=757.88s)]
*  And I think that relationship is really important here. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=758.88s)]
*  So where's everybody else in the region, though, when you say the U.S. and Israel go in after [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=760.1600000000001s)]
*  we get it, you know, as many hostages as... [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=764.5600000000001s)]
*  By the way, I don't know who's dealing with PIJ, the Palestinian Islamic Jihadists, because [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=766.72s)]
*  that's a different situation. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=772.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=773.0s)]
*  You heard Kirby say he doesn't know, you know, which hostages are with them or how many. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=774.0s)]
*  We're not in charge of this. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=777.44s)]
*  But what about the rest of the region? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=778.44s)]
*  I mean, because they ought to be joining us when we go in to clear out those scorpions [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=779.9200000000001s)]
*  alongside Israel. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=783.6s)]
*  And in our minds, I, Maria and I are saying, go get the hostages and then go kill everybody [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=784.9200000000001s)]
*  who did this. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=789.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=790.4s)]
*  To Israel. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=791.4s)]
*  That is the key question. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=792.4s)]
*  And, Maria, in all due respect, you know, you say they've been negotiating powerfully. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=793.4s)]
*  Yes, we have gotten hostages back. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=795.88s)]
*  We should have never been hostage, because I don't believe this attack would have taken [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=797.6800000000001s)]
*  place on President Trump's watch, because this administration has not shown strength [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=800.2s)]
*  on the world stage. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=805.32s)]
*  The one question that should have been asked was not asked in that briefing. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=806.5s)]
*  Maybe it was asked before we dropped in. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=809.28s)]
*  I didn't hear it, though. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=811.32s)]
*  My question, if I'm a White House correspondent, would have been, why have you not redesignated [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=812.6s)]
*  the Houthis as a terrorist organization? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=817.12s)]
*  Guess who did? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=819.04s)]
*  President Trump on January 15th of 2021. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=820.88s)]
*  They were delisted on February 4th by the Biden administration. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=823.5600000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, now we learn Houthis are trying to hijack ships. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=827.5600000000001s)]
*  They're shooting off ballistic missiles near Americans. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=830.8s)]
*  Why have you not listed them? [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=833.28s)]
*  Pompeo told me it's inexcusable. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=834.28s)]
*  Why haven't you relisted them? [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=836.5600000000001s)]
*  You know what's interesting about that, too, because we've been talking about Darfur and [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=838.04s)]
*  Sudan, and not a lot of people are talking about that. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=841.4s)]
*  And I want to spend just a second to show people how things are rolling out right now. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  We've got a lot of hate and evil in the world and the rapes and the beheading and all of [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=848.88s)]
*  that you're seeing in other places. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=853.64s)]
*  Darfur has seen a lot of atrocities, but evil is on the march. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=855.4799999999999s)]
*  I post about this a lot. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=859.28s)]
*  And so notice there in Sudan, house to house, they went looking for non-Arabs. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=861.2399999999999s)]
*  In recent weeks and killing them. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=867.48s)]
*  And the Biden White House was part of a ceasefire negotiation along with the Saudis, and it [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=870.12s)]
*  didn't hold. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=876.48s)]
*  And now it seems like we've backed away. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=877.84s)]
*  I don't know what the story is. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=879.48s)]
*  Nobody's focused on the list of people that I need to pray for every night seems to continue [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=880.9200000000001s)]
*  to grow. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=885.76s)]
*  And they're doing the same. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=886.76s)]
*  At the beginning of the year, it was people in Ukraine and now it's people in Israel and [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=888.88s)]
*  all over the world. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=892.6800000000001s)]
*  Some stories don't get enough attention or as much attention as they deserve. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=894.44s)]
*  A part of this issue also is what's going to happen after this war ends. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=897.8800000000001s)]
*  And President Biden has said that he wants a two state solution and he's calling for [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=901.84s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority to take over Gaza, which will not fly with Israel. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=905.4000000000001s)]
*  There's a Wall Street Journal op-ed that called the Palestinian Authority and the Fatah Party [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=910.7600000000001s)]
*  JV Hamas. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=915.2800000000001s)]
*  They celebrated October 7th and they recently denied that the music festival attack took [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=916.8800000000001s)]
*  place. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=921.84s)]
*  They said if it did, it was Israel killed its own people. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=922.84s)]
*  So there's going to be a lot of questions over who takes over this region and what is [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=926.24s)]
*  to come when this fighting ends. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=932.5600000000001s)]
*  The other thing I do want to point out that originally was pointed out by Lucas Tomlinson. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=934.6800000000001s)]
*  He was following the president in Nantucket. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=938.6800000000001s)]
*  President made a speech after the first American was released, little Abigail, as we now know. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=941.24s)]
*  And there was one really interesting moment where he talked about the future of Hamas [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=946.44s)]
*  and he chose his words very carefully. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=952.24s)]
*  He started to say the goal for Hamas should be the complete and it almost sounded like [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=954.4s)]
*  he was going to say eradication. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=959.0999999999999s)]
*  But he stopped himself and he said the goal should be that Hamas no longer controls the [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=961.0799999999999s)]
*  Gaza Strip, which is in opposition to what Israel would want in this situation. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=965.8s)]
*  That may be because we are in delicate hostage negotiations right now, but I did think that [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=971.3199999999999s)]
*  was notable. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=974.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, it is notable. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=975.92s)]
*  So what would they want? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=977.18s)]
*  Like a relocation development program for Hamas to get them out of Gaza? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=978.18s)]
*  Because as long as they're in Gaza, they're going to try to kill Israelis. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=983.38s)]
*  It's in their charter. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=986.9799999999999s)]
*  That is their goal. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GFt6ETb88Uc&t=988.5s)]
