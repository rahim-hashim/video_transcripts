# Israel evacuating city near Lebanon border
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs)
*  Let's go to Steve Harrigan who is in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=0.0s)]
*  Steve, what are you seeing and hearing there? [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=2.6s)]
*  Charles, the fighting is already underway in the north. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=5.84s)]
*  Israeli forces as well as Hezbollah fighters really going back and forth for the past two [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=10.8s)]
*  weeks firing rockets at each other. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=15.66s)]
*  Israeli defense forces just released a video of what they say is the destruction of a Hezbollah [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=18.1s)]
*  terror cell in Lebanon. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=23.6s)]
*  Also the destruction of a moving target. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=26.0s)]
*  It may have been a drone or a missile heading towards Israel from Lebanon. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=28.74s)]
*  The destruction of that as well. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=32.62s)]
*  So this is a fight that's already active. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=33.9s)]
*  The question is how big is it going to get? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=35.98s)]
*  It's clear Israel is already preparing for a fight that could get much bigger. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=38.54s)]
*  They evacuated the city of Kiryat Shmona, about 22,000 people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=42.62s)]
*  They moved them to government-funded guest houses. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=47.22s)]
*  So really trying to get civilians out of the way for trouble that may be ahead and trouble [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=50.22s)]
*  here in Lebanon as well they are preparing as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=54.459999999999994s)]
*  The national air carrier cutting flights, moving its airplanes to other countries for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=57.26s)]
*  fear of possible destruction ahead. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=61.98s)]
*  Charles back to you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=64.48s)]
*  Steve, thank you very much. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=65.48s)]
*  As you heard, a U.S. warship shooting down missiles appearing to target Israel and the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=66.48s)]
*  bases in Iraq and Syria coming under repeat drone attacks. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=71.53999999999999s)]
*  So does this mean the U.S. risk being drawn deeper into this conflict? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_2G2PyKABs&t=75.3s)]
