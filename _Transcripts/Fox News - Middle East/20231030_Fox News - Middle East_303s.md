# Why are US troops in Syria and Iran anyway? Lt. Col Daniel Davis explains
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco)
*  The U.S. striking back at Iranian-backed groups in response to the growing attacks on U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=0.0s)]
*  troops in Iraq and Syria. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=5.12s)]
*  The Pentagon says they are ready to do it again in the strategy of deterrence. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=6.96s)]
*  Let's bring in retired Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  He is a senior fellow and military expert at Defense Priorities. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=13.8s)]
*  Colonel, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=17.72s)]
*  I want to make sure our viewers continue to bring them along with the geography of this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=19.52s)]
*  moment. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=23.56s)]
*  U.S. airstrikes on Iranian-linked forces in Syria. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=24.56s)]
*  Location here, Abu Kamal, right on the Syria-Iraq border. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=30.24s)]
*  What message are we sending here, Colonel, as we do look back at the timeline and the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=34.6s)]
*  number of attacks on U.S. forces in the Middle East, 20 attacks so far. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=39.5s)]
*  What about the American response here? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=46.64s)]
*  Is it enough and do you expect more? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=48.92s)]
*  Yeah, unfortunately I expect more. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=52.32s)]
*  But look, we got to back up a little bit and ask a bigger question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=55.239999999999995s)]
*  Why are there American troops in Syria and Iraq anyway? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=59.0s)]
*  Now, interestingly enough, four years ago, I came on with Harris Faulkner on this network [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=62.599999999999994s)]
*  and I was talking about President Trump who said he was going to withdraw all our troops [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=68.36s)]
*  from Syria. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=72.58s)]
*  And I said at that time I wholeheartedly endorsed it because all they're doing is being points [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=73.58s)]
*  of vulnerability for our country where it makes it possible for Iran-backed groups to [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=79.8s)]
*  attack them. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=83.39999999999999s)]
*  They're not serving any value to our country whatsoever and we're having our troops in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=84.39999999999999s)]
*  harm's way and they need to be withdrawn. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=88.42s)]
*  I said it back then and I'm saying it again now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=91.28s)]
*  The issue should not be how many more times should we go and hit these groups or should [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=93.8s)]
*  we strike Iran because that could draw us into another Mideast war and that is the worst [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=98.56s)]
*  thing for American national interest right now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=102.96s)]
*  We need to reduce our vulnerability and get those guys out. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=104.96s)]
*  Sorry about that, Colonel. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=108.52s)]
*  The U.S. military is saying they chose these locations because of a number of the munitions [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=109.52s)]
*  used in the strikes on U.S. service members in the last 10 days came from those locations. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=114.67999999999999s)]
*  All right, to the news obviously of the moment and watching the Iranian weapons that are [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=121.8s)]
*  flooding into the West Bank. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=127.67999999999999s)]
*  The red lines on the screen are the Iranian smuggling routes. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=130.84s)]
*  the Middle East on into this area here, the dotted line as you get into the western border [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=135.8s)]
*  of Israel, Gaza here. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=143.12s)]
*  These are the assessed route to the West Bank. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=146.12s)]
*  You've got this constant flow of Iranian weapons that are flooding to the West Bank. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=150.32000000000002s)]
*  What does that mean for this current moment in this escalating conflict, Colonel? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you what it means that it's going to continue. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=160.4s)]
*  We can say that we know where those routes are, but we can't stop them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=164.72s)]
*  Number one, it's not our job to do that, but neither can Israel. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=168.52s)]
*  I saw this same exact dynamic when I was deployed the last time in 2010 in Afghanistan where [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=171.24s)]
*  there was all kinds of routes coming in from Pakistan where there's nonstop support into [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=176.24s)]
*  the Taliban that was in there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=181.24s)]
*  And we knew the stuff was coming, but there's just no way to interdict it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=182.8s)]
*  And there's not going to be any way here either. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  The issue is that Israel is going to have to fight this battle and those kinds of weapons [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=188.28s)]
*  and ammunition is going to find some way to get in because that's what people who are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=193.0s)]
*  desperate will do. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=196.88s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=197.88s)]
*  I'm bringing back up the general map here, Mediterranean Sea, obviously the West Bank. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=198.88s)]
*  We are just talking about the flow of those Iranian weapons directly over the borders [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=202.88s)]
*  to this general area. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=207.72s)]
*  Here's the Gaza Strip and this is what we are watching at this moment and the movement [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=210.08s)]
*  of the Israeli forces right now with the Israeli army saying that ground forces are quote expanding [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  their activity into Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=219.74s)]
*  We know that they have been lined up along the border there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=222.56s)]
*  So what do you see happening next with all this? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=224.96s)]
*  And is this preceding an ultimate large scale ground invasion by Israel into northern Gaza? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=227.6s)]
*  Yeah I think it's virtually certain at this point. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=235.88s)]
*  And as I believe I heard General Kellogg say just a minute ago, these are standard kinds [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=239.16s)]
*  of operations that you'll see in a precursor to a long larger force going in. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=243.84s)]
*  It's reconnaissance. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=247.76s)]
*  It's finding out where the routes are that you want to go to, clearing any routes of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=249.26s)]
*  potential mines because there's a lot of those. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=253.26s)]
*  And I believe it could also be coming pretty soon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=256.78s)]
*  And of course it's going to be a big issue for Israel because Hamas has said that that [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=260.18s)]
*  would be their trigger to come in potentially from the north and other groups are going [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=264.21999999999997s)]
*  to potentially join in. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=268.06s)]
*  And there's already a great deal of anti-Israel sentiment in Egypt, in Lebanon, in Saudi Arabia, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=269.46s)]
*  and that could really exacerbate it further which could make things a lot difficult for [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=278.78s)]
*  the Israeli defense forces because we've got to understand it's not just what's happening [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=283.5s)]
*  in the Gaza Strip but it's what's happening all around them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=287.58s)]
*  So Israel has got a lot of vulnerabilities here. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=290.38s)]
*  That's a great point. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=292.98s)]
*  The idea says it's acting with great force to achieve the objectives of this war. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=294.06s)]
*  We'll be watching every minute of it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=298.82s)]
*  Colonel, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=300.3s)]
*  Appreciate your time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=301.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l1un4ej4sco&t=302.65999999999997s)]
