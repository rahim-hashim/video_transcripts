# Pro-Palestinian protesters interrupt committee hearing on free speech on campuses
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE)
*  I'd like to introduce to you the flag of the United States of America and to the republic [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=0.0s)]
*  for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7.0s)]
*  all. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=14.0s)]
*  I thank the gentlemen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=15.0s)]
*  We will now begin with opening statements. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=20.0s)]
*  The chair recognizes himself. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=22.0s)]
*  Over six years ago, we had a hearing about attempts to curtail free speech on college [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=24.0s)]
*  campuses right next door in the oversight committee. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=29.0s)]
*  The hearing touched on emerging threats to the First Amendment, safe spaces, cancel culture, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=32.0s)]
*  and the targeting of conservative activist student groups. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=37.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, this was not a fad, and the hostility towards certain points of view, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=41.0s)]
*  and particularly conservative points of view, has only grown worse. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=45.0s)]
*  And it's no longer universities just censoring their students. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=49.0s)]
*  We now know that American universities were working with the federal government to systematically [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=53.0s)]
*  target speech on the internet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=57.0s)]
*  Just this week, the committee Republicans released information showing Stanford University [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=59.0s)]
*  worked with the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, and the State Department's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=64.0s)]
*  Global Engagement Center to censor certain speech in the lead up to the 2020 election. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=70.0s)]
*  Big government, big academia, and big tech all colluding to limit Americans' First Amendment [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=75.0s)]
*  free speech rights. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=81.0s)]
*  They were targeting jokes, political opinions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=83.0s)]
*  Most importantly, they targeted true information. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=86.0s)]
*  But the speech that was censored all leaned a certain way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=89.0s)]
*  What used to be the bastions of free speech and the marketplace of ideas evolved into [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=93.0s)]
*  institutions of activism and suppression. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=97.0s)]
*  With, quote, safe spaces and free speech zones aimed to protect students from violence, one [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=100.0s)]
*  would think Jewish students would have somewhere to turn as violent pro-Hamas students take [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=104.0s)]
*  to their demonstrations and have harmed students on college campuses. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=109.0s)]
*  But that's not the case, as we will see in today's hearing. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=113.0s)]
*  Nearly a 400% increase in anti-Semitic incidents, including harassment, vandalism, and assault [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=116.0s)]
*  in the two weeks after the Hamas attacks against Israel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=123.0s)]
*  We need to be doing more to protect the freedom of expression. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=126.0s)]
*  We're actually working with the ranking member Nadler on some legislation introduced by one [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=130.0s)]
*  of our colleagues trying to see if we can put some legislation forward that would help [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=135.0s)]
*  in this area. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=139.0s)]
*  I want to thank my colleagues, including Representative Virginia Foxx, Chairwoman of the Education [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=140.0s)]
*  Workforce Committee, for her important work on these issues. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=145.0s)]
*  I want to thank Representative Murphy, who is the leader on this topic, has introduced [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=148.0s)]
*  two bills to advance free speech on campus, and co-chair of the Campus Free Speech Caucus, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=152.0s)]
*  Ms. Kamik, for her work and passion for this issue. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=158.0s)]
*  I also want to recognize Mr. Kiley, one of our members, who introduced a bill just last [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=161.0s)]
*  week that denounced anti-Semitism on college campuses. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=165.0s)]
*  We look forward to hearing from all our witnesses today. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=169.0s)]
*  And again, I want to thank you for coming. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=171.0s)]
*  I now will turn to the ranking member for his opening statement, and then we'll get [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=172.0s)]
*  right to our witnesses. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=176.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chair. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=177.0s)]
*  Actually, I forgot. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=178.0s)]
*  Well, I'll wait until yours is done, then I'll play a short video. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=180.0s)]
*  We have a short 90-second video I wanted to show. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=182.0s)]
*  We'll play it right now. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=185.0s)]
*  Let's play it right now. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=186.0s)]
*  A 90-second video. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=187.0s)]
*  You can cue that up. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=188.0s)]
*  We'll play this about what's going on on college campuses. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=189.0s)]
*  Free speech debates have royal college campuses with protests against conservative guest speakers. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=196.0s)]
*  The fight against conservative speakers on college campuses escalated. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=202.0s)]
*  Administrators failed to stop some students from heckling a conservative speaker on campus. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=206.0s)]
*  Former college swimmer Riley Gates says she was assaulted after giving a speech at San [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=211.0s)]
*  Francisco State University. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=216.0s)]
*  I understand and share your objections to a speaker whose rhetoric is offensive and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=218.0s)]
*  clearly intended to shock and provoke. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=222.0s)]
*  I don't think they're less able to listen to opposing views. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=224.0s)]
*  I just think they take less crap. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=226.0s)]
*  Students have been making national headlines protesting controversial speakers on campuses [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=228.0s)]
*  across the country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=232.0s)]
*  Is free speech dead on campus? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=233.0s)]
*  No, we don't want him to speak. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=235.0s)]
*  Hopefully we can drown him out. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=237.0s)]
*  That's conservative podcaster Michael Knowles being burned in Effigy at the University of [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=238.0s)]
*  Pittsburgh. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=242.0s)]
*  Their opinions from the bench land as absolute disenfranchisement of their rights. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=243.0s)]
*  The president of the University of Pennsylvania critics say she is not sending a strong enough [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=247.0s)]
*  message against anti-Semitism. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=251.0s)]
*  I don't hear people talking about Israeli violence. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=253.0s)]
*  Hamas has shifted the balance of power. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=257.0s)]
*  Hamas has changed the terms of debate. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=259.0s)]
*  The Jewish fraternity was hit with a graffiti attack of the Jews are Nazis. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=261.0s)]
*  This is our university too. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=267.0s)]
*  I want to thank our staff for putting that together and chair recognizes the ranking [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=270.0s)]
*  member, the gentleman from New York for an opening statement. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=278.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=280.0s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, one month ago yesterday on October 7th, Hamas launched a barbaric attack on the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=281.0s)]
*  people of Israel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=287.0s)]
*  Hamas killed more than 1,400 people and kidnapped 250 more. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=288.0s)]
*  Many of them very old, many of them very young, and some of them American citizens. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=292.0s)]
*  The attack represents the largest loss of Jewish life in a single day since the conclusion [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=297.0s)]
*  of the Holocaust. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=302.0s)]
*  Here in the United States, the Jewish community has had little time to mourn. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=303.0s)]
*  The steady rise in anti-Semitism in this country over the past several years has now reached [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=307.0s)]
*  fever pitch. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=312.0s)]
*  And few places have had to bear the weight of that trend more than our college and university [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=313.0s)]
*  campuses. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=318.0s)]
*  We're according to an audit published by the Anti-Defamation League months before the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=319.0s)]
*  October 7th attack, anti-Semitic activity had increased by 41% in the last year alone. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=324.0s)]
*  In many ways, the conduct we need to discuss most urgently goes far beyond the title of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=331.0s)]
*  this hearing, Free Speech on Campus. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=336.0s)]
*  Jewish students are being physically threatened and have legitimate cause to fear for their [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=339.0s)]
*  safety on campuses across the country. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=343.0s)]
*  For example, at Cornell University, law enforcement officials arrested a student for making violent [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=346.0s)]
*  threats against Jewish students on an Internet message board. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=351.0s)]
*  These messages included the exhortation that, quote, if you see a Jewish person on campus, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=355.0s)]
*  follow them home and slit their throats, close quote. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=360.0s)]
*  In another post, the student threatened to, quote, bring an assault rifle to campus and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=364.0s)]
*  shoot all you pig Jews, close quote. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=369.0s)]
*  We are joined today by a student from Cornell University, Amanda Silberstein. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=372.0s)]
*  Ms. Silberstein, I would just like to say that I am sorry that you and the Jewish community [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=377.0s)]
*  at Cornell have had to endure these threats simply for being who you are. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=382.0s)]
*  And I am sorry for the fear they have caused you and your fellow students. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=386.0s)]
*  It is unacceptable and we must do better. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=389.0s)]
*  There is no excuse for that kind of violence at any school, against any student. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=392.0s)]
*  And an academic discussion about the First Amendment is mostly beside the point until [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=397.0s)]
*  we can secure these campuses. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=402.0s)]
*  I think that most members here on both sides of the aisle would agree. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=404.0s)]
*  Which is not to say, Mr. Chairman, that I do not appreciate your calling this hearing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=407.0s)]
*  Congress can help. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=412.0s)]
*  But first we have to put aside the political stunts and academic debates and put our money where our mouth is. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=414.0s)]
*  The Office for Civil Rights at the Department of Education is the federal agency responsible for [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=420.0s)]
*  enforcing the laws that protect students from discrimination. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=426.0s)]
*  To be clear, the Office for Civil Rights had an enormous amount of work to do long before the attacks of October 7th. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=429.0s)]
*  The reaction to those attacks in the United States may threaten to overwhelm the agency. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=436.0s)]
*  That is why the Anti-Defamation League and their partner organization, the Brandeis Center, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=441.0s)]
*  which is represented here today, have set up a helpline to aid Jewish students navigate the process [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=446.0s)]
*  for filing complaints alleging anti-Semitism during this troubling time. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=452.0s)]
*  I would like to commend both organizations for their important work, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=456.0s)]
*  and I encourage Jewish students across the country to make their voices heard. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=460.0s)]
*  Congress also has an obligation to help. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=464.0s)]
*  More than that, we have an obligation to offer meaningful help. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=467.0s)]
*  If we want to get this situation under control, we need to move past debating the various theoretical definitions of the word anti-Semitism. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=470.0s)]
*  We need to move past the meaningless resolutions on the House floor declaring our feelings about bigotry generally. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=478.0s)]
*  We need to send assistance where it is urgently needed, and we need to do so today. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=484.0s)]
*  Earlier this year, the Biden administration outlined a comprehensive national strategy to counter anti-Semitism. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=489.0s)]
*  For that matter, the administration has also announced a national strategy to counter Islamophobia. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=496.0s)]
*  These strategies are whole-of-government efforts to combat bigotry in every part of American life that the government can touch. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=501.0s)]
*  The President has put enforcement of our civil rights laws at the center of these strategies. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=508.0s)]
*  Long before we could have foreseen the wave of violent anti-Semitism that would sweep across the country, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=513.0s)]
*  President Biden requested a 27 percent increase in funding for the Office of Civil Rights. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=518.0s)]
*  If my Republican colleagues were serious about this issue, they would fully fund that request. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=524.0s)]
*  Instead, they are fighting to slash the budget of the Office of Civil Rights and other agencies that would keep our children safe. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=529.0s)]
*  Their promises about anti-Semitism and their actions disconnect in other ways as well. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=539.0s)]
*  If my Republican colleagues were serious about anti-Semitism, they would have spoken up after the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=544.0s)]
*  where neo-Nazis chanted that, quote, Jews will not replace us. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=552.0s)]
*  If my Republican colleagues were serious about anti-Semitism, they would have spoken up when President Trump then declared that they were, quote, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=556.0s)]
*  very fine people on both sides of that rally. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=563.0s)]
*  If they were serious about anti-Semitism, they would have said something last year when former President Trump shared a meal with Nick Fuentes, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=566.0s)]
*  a notorious white supremacist and Holocaust denier. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=573.0s)]
*  And lest you imagine that I am dredging up ancient history, let me remind you that if my Republican colleagues were serious about anti-Semitism, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=577.0s)]
*  they would not have just months ago invited Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to testify in this hearing room after he made appalling claims [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=585.0s)]
*  that Jews appear to be immune from COVID-19, a nod to the laughable, if not so insidious, conspiracy that the virus was somehow engineered to spare the Jewish community. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=594.0s)]
*  My friends, for too long your silence on these matters has been deafening. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=605.0s)]
*  I am all for free speech, on campuses and otherwise, and that includes the right of my Republican colleagues to say nothing at all about anti-Semitism when silence is politically convenient, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=609.0s)]
*  even when the former President of the United States takes aim at us directly. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=620.0s)]
*  But if you mean what you say here today, if you believe that the threats and vitriol that my community faces on college campuses is both unfair and unjust, [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=625.0s)]
*  then I am asking you to move beyond the pointless gestures and political posturing and help us protect our children. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=633.0s)]
*  Fully fund the Office for Civil Rights, the administration's efforts to counter anti-Semitism, and other forms of discrimination. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=639.0s)]
*  Help us get the boots on the ground. We can do better, and our students deserve no less. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=647.0s)]
*  I thank the witnesses, and I yield back. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=652.0s)]
*  I thank the gentleman. The gentleman yields back. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=655.0s)]

*  I think we'll just go like like we did. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=806.0s)]

*  Cease fire now! [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=869.0s)]
*  Cease fire now! [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=871.0s)]
*  Cease fire now! [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=873.0s)]

*  Although I had hoped... [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=890.0s)]
*  ...to be up against genocide, become anti-Semitism, house of the same- [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=892.0s)]
*  Committee will be in order. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=897.0s)]
*  ...more values of young children and students are trade. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=899.0s)]
*  What is your right to teach them all that they're not free? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=903.0s)]
*  What does it mean if they decide to... [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=906.0s)]
*  Fire again. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=916.0s)]
*  Although I had hoped that my arrival to fire... [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=918.0s)]
*  Here's the hearing for Palestinian students. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=920.0s)]
*  Palestinian liberation is not anti-Semitism. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=935.0s)]
*  Bring Gaza! Bring Gaza! Bring Gaza! [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=950.0s)]
*  Mr. Egrijec, we'll keep trying. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=963.0s)]
*  Thank you, Chairman Jordan, Ranking Member Nedler, and members of the committee. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=966.0s)]
*  Palestinians deserve to speak on the genocide of their families! [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=970.0s)]
*  Palestinians deserve to speak on the genocide of their families. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=975.0s)]
*  Stop silenting Palestinians! [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=981.0s)]
*  Stop silenting Palestinians! [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=987.0s)]
*  Stop silenting Palestinians! [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=993.0s)]
*  Stop silenting Palestinians! [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=996.0s)]
*  You want to talk about putting money where your mouth is? [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1005.0s)]
*  There are ten thousand, over ten thousand who have gotten dead and more buried, half [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1009.08s)]
*  of whom are under the age of 18. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1016.38s)]
*  And you're going to send money and talk about this? [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1024.36s)]
*  Where are the anti-liberal issues in this room? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1031.02s)]
*  You are not offering the morality of a Indian. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1032.42s)]
*  You are offering partisanship. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1037.42s)]
*  And you are offering murder to more Muslims. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1039.42s)]
*  Free Palestine! [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1043.42s)]
*  My name is Connor O'Grijoc, and it is an honor to bring my experiences before you today. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1050.42s)]
*  Although I had hoped that my arrival to higher education would mark the arrival to a bastion of free speech, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1054.42s)]
*  many of my first-hand experiences of freedom of speech violations at the University of Buffalo came during my membership of UB's chapter of Young Americans for Freedom. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1059.42s)]
*  Two of the most prominent examples of freedom of speech bias that I witnessed at the University each came in the form of speaker events hosted by my chapter. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1069.42s)]
*  In spring of 2022, as Vice Chair of my chapter, I had the opportunity to assist with hosting Lieutenant Colonel Allen West at UB, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1077.42s)]
*  an event which was preceded by delays in the signing of our contract and a forced venue change which was exposed by a Freedom of Information request. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1084.42s)]
*  However, the most striking action taking against us followed Lieutenant Colonel West's speech, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1091.42s)]
*  which had included a discussion of race in America and accounts from his decorated past. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1096.42s)]
*  When the floor was opened to a question-and-answer session, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1101.42s)]
*  student protesters shouted from their seats before the audiovisual employees from UB's Student Association, the Student Government, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1104.42s)]
*  cut powers to the event's microphones and speakers, ending the session. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1110.42s)]
*  Confrontations continued upon the exit from the event and once outside, as you just saw in the video before the opening statements, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1114.42s)]
*  chapter members were chased by a 100-person mob across campus. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1120.42s)]
*  What that footage did not show was the former chapter chair being forced into a bathroom where she called 911 for rescue and another board member being physically attacked. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1124.42s)]
*  With silence from the University and charges not pressed by the Erie County District Attorney's Office, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1133.42s)]
*  I have since been left to consider the precedent this sets for those who plan to protest future events on campus. [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1139.42s)]
*  Though I may not be qualified to determine what constitutes adequate evidence in the eyes of the justice system, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1144.42s)]
*  if those who were involved in this mob were able to result to fear tactics and violence without consequence, [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1151.42s)]
*  what is keeping a pattern of this despicable behavior from being set and executed repeatedly? [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1157.42s)]
*  This thought remained on my mind throughout the planning of a March 2023 event that I hosted as chairman featuring Michael Knowles. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1162.42s)]
*  This event would grow to gain more pushback than any event on campus in the previous four years and provide the most clear-cut examples of freedom of speech violations. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1169.42s)]
*  This pushback included delays in contract signing from UB's Student Association that deviated far from their outlined standard course of action, [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1178.42s)]
*  condemnation of the event by a local New York State Senator and multiple Western New York-based organizations, [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1186.42s)]
*  a circulated petition constructed by three university professors calling for the cancellation of the lecture, which gained thousands of student signatures, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1192.42s)]
*  a forced venue change orchestrated not only by university administration this time, but voted on by a SUNY council, [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1200.42s)]
*  a multitude of threats and torn literature, and even a tweet from Governor Kathy Hochul on the day of the event calling comments from Michael dehumanizing. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1206.42s)]
*  The decry of this event garnered a responding statement from University President Satish Tripathi explaining that the Constitution protects speech on campus, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1215.42s)]
*  quote, no matter how noxious the content, end quote. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1222.42s)]
*  Based on the actions taken by faculty and the rhetoric used by Tripathi, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1226.42s)]
*  I cannot name more clear examples of evidence that demonstrate the case of a university concerned only with following the letter of the law, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1230.42s)]
*  rather than uplifting conservative values to a level equivalent with the values of the left, [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1237.42s)]
*  which are often celebrated in the university's own distinguished speaker series. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1242.42s)]
*  Unfortunately, this was forced to extend into a federal lawsuit with representation by Alliance Defending Freedom, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1246.42s)]
*  once our YAF chapter was banned from campus as the result of a new national affiliation ban by the student government. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1251.42s)]
*  Though I graduated in the previous spring semester and am no longer able to engage in discourse with opposing students, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1257.42s)]
*  I am fortunate to still have friends on campus, including current YAF board members who can. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1264.42s)]
*  Something that has particularly concerned me recently, both on campus and off, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1269.42s)]
*  is the outward support for Hamas under the guise of support for Palestinian civilians. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1273.42s)]
*  I will not generalize entire groups, however, an unsettling number of students who appeared both in a 300-person pro-Palestine march on campus, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1278.42s)]
*  as well as a protest against a pro-Israel speaker, did not solely speak out in support of Palestinian civilians. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1287.42s)]
*  Rather, these students stated their support for Hamas directly. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1293.42s)]
*  I would like to be clear, regardless of background, I do not wish for civilian death. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1297.42s)]
*  Support for Hamas is not support for Palestinian civilians, it is the opposite. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1302.42s)]
*  Support for Hamas is support for a terrorist organization, and this must not be misconstrued. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1306.42s)]
*  Regardless of what side of the political aisle you reside on, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1311.42s)]
*  it should be common ground that no student deserves to be threatened, mistreated, or silenced on campus due to their personal beliefs. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1314.42s)]
*  Conservative students currently face a relentless uphill battle for representation on campus, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1321.42s)]
*  and though we may seek support from outside groups and legislators such as yourselves, we will not accept the label of victims. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1326.42s)]
*  Standing up for your beliefs will never be a waste of time, and as Americans, we hold this in our hearts. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1332.42s)]
*  I thank you for your time. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1337.42s)]
*  Thank you. Miss Jordan, you are recognized. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1339.42s)]
*  Good morning, Chairman Jordan, Ranking Member Nadler, and the members of the committee. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1342.42s)]
*  My name is Jasmine Jordan, and I'm blessed to have the opportunity to speak with you all today. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1348.42s)]
*  I was raised in the church and homeschooled from preschool through fifth grade. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1352.42s)]
*  Both of these were crucial in shaping my early upbringing and my worldview. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1355.42s)]
*  They gave me the strong foundation of moral beliefs and values that the Constitution was founded on. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1359.42s)]
*  Lessons like iron sharpens iron, be a leader, not a follower, and so help me God, are ingrained into every aspect of my character. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1364.42s)]
*  As I progressed through the public school environment, the strong moral compass guided me throughout my journey, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1371.42s)]
*  and I carried it with me to college. [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1376.42s)]
*  In spring 2022, I joined Iowa Young Americans for Freedom when I discovered that this organization [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1378.42s)]
*  aligned with the Christian conservative values instilled in me by my church and family. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1383.42s)]
*  The more involved I became in the club, the more I discovered that the playing field for freedom of speech on college campuses was not equalized. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1388.42s)]
*  The first time I noticed this was when Iowa YAF hosted Kellyanne Conway as a speaker. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1395.42s)]
*  In response, I was doxed in a group chat of over 800 students and was falsely labeled as a Nazi, a token, a white supremacist, and a bigot. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1400.42s)]
*  Some individuals even expressed that I made them uncomfortable and feared that I might commit a hate crime against them simply because I am black and hold conservative principles. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1410.42s)]
*  These students believe that if you are conservative, you are hateful, support oppression, and only want to benefit straight white men, [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1421.42s)]
*  even though such beliefs are untrue. When we hosted Lieutenant Colonel Allen West to speak on campus last year, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1428.42s)]
*  he spoke on the topic of debunking diversity, equity, and inclusion and proved that America is not racist. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1434.42s)]
*  We used chalk advertisements to promote the lecture, which is something many colleges do to effectively let students know about upcoming events. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1441.42s)]
*  Immediately, our chalk was altered, which is a violation of school policy. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1448.42s)]
*  New messages were put in place saying that Allen West is racist and that racism is prevalent in schools, thus critical race theory should be supported. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1453.42s)]
*  At Allen West's lecture, a protester stood in the back holding a sign that read, stop the alt right, punch your local Nazi today. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1460.42s)]
*  This is blatant irony. Conservatives are slandered by students and faculty as harmful, [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1468.42s)]
*  yet here's an obvious example of someone openly delivering a violent threat and facing no repercussions. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1473.42s)]
*  The entitlement continues. I find that when a conservative doesn't want to hear a speaker, they just don't attend the event. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1479.42s)]
*  But when a leftist doesn't want to hear a speaker, they do everything they can to shut the lecture down. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1485.42s)]
*  Our club recently hosted Matt Walsh. Students and faculty were willing to do anything to cancel the event just because they found Walsh's speech to be offensive. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1489.42s)]
*  Some people were so dedicated to silencing our voices that literally as one of us was advertising with chalk, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1498.42s)]
*  a leftist student was erasing each of those letters with a wipe. We received death threats along with plenty of verbal harassment. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1504.42s)]
*  That night, before the speaking event, my hallmate, who happened to be the one erasing the chalk, [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1511.42s)]
*  stalked outside of my bedroom door by putting his ear on it to see if I was in my room because he was just so outraged by my involvement. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1515.42s)]
*  That was a terrifying experience, but what I find to be more appalling is when I talked to our hall coordinator about this and she replied, [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1523.42s)]
*  people are allowed to think, feel, and react however they want to about this upcoming event. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1532.42s)]
*  At the event, someone threw 20,000 marbles on the floor to prevent people from entering the venue. Attendees were spat on. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1538.42s)]
*  Outside, a popular pep band well known to our school played loud music to try and drown out the speaker's message. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1546.42s)]
*  I share these occurrences with you all to show that despite repeatedly meeting with the university administration, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1552.42s)]
*  these individuals are continually permitted to be broken by left-leaning students. They are in fact coddled by our school. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1558.42s)]
*  The university expresses affirmations and puts together support, solidarity, and celebration spaces. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1565.42s)]
*  These individuals act out against conservatives without care or consequence and are empowered to act this way because of the lack of action by the administration and university leaders. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1571.42s)]
*  Conservative organizations do not get the same resources that these other organizations receive. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1583.42s)]
*  Conservatives often have to hide who they are and what they believe in so that they do not lose relationships or receive a lower grade or face constant doxing, harassment, intimidation, or threats. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1588.42s)]
*  I went to college with the expectation that I would hear different points of view because I thought it would be a place where young people could come together, disagree, and still be friendly and courteous to one another. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1600.42s)]
*  However, after two years, I've realized that this is not the case at all and that students who hold opposing views are often subjected to frequent violent threats and other forms of harassment with no accountability. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1610.42s)]
*  Our founding fathers guaranteed every U.S. citizen the right to free speech in the Constitution. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1622.42s)]
*  It is an important resource for all Americans, not just a small percentage of them, particularly if they hold different views and ideas than those of others. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1627.42s)]
*  To ensure that peaceful continuation of the nation, we must all come together and understand that differing opinions and expressing them, we should nevertheless show respect for one another and refrain from causing each other bodily, mental, or emotional harm. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1635.42s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1650.42s)]
*  Thank you, Ms. Jordan. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1651.42s)]
*  Ms. Silberstein, you're recognized. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1652.42s)]
*  I was alone in a world gone mad. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1654.42s)]
*  These are the words my grandfather wrote on the day in October 1942 after his father had been shot dead and the Jews in his small Polish town, including his entire family, were deported to a death camp. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1659.42s)]
*  He was a teenager, alone in a labor camp with a bleak future filled with unimaginable suffering. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1671.42s)]
*  I have thought about my grandfather's words often in the 32 days since October 7th, and I have watched what I can only describe as a world gone mad. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1677.42s)]
*  I have seen and heard things on and around Cornell's campus that just over a month ago, I could not have imagined. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1685.42s)]
*  Cornell professor Russell Rickford publicly justified and celebrated barbaric acts of terror as exhilarating and energizing, describing the torture, rape, and murder of innocent women and children as resistance. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1692.42s)]
*  I see classmates perpetuating age-old anti-Semitic tropes on social media. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1705.42s)]
*  I walk across a campus defaced with anti-Israel signage and graffiti, seeing phrases such as F-Israel and Zionism equals genocide. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1711.42s)]
*  Anti-Zionism and anti-Semitism are inextricably linked. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1720.42s)]
*  This is evidenced by the Jew hatred that consistently and openly accompanies attacks on Zionism. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1724.42s)]
*  On campus, I am now confronted daily with shouts to free Palestine from the river to the sea. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1730.42s)]
*  This catchy chant is not about peace or sovereignty for the Palestinian people. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1737.42s)]
*  It is a call for a Palestinian state extending from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea, a territory that encompasses the entire state of Israel. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1741.42s)]
*  It is a Jew-hating, genocidal mandate seeking to deny the Jewish right to self-determination in Israel. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1749.42s)]
*  It is a call to exterminate all Jews in accordance with Hamas' open and unequivocal goal. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1755.42s)]
*  This chant is not about Palestinian life. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1761.42s)]
*  It is about Jewish death. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1764.42s)]
*  Imagine that you frequent Jewish events on campus. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1768.42s)]
*  Imagine that you live in a Jewish sorority house. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1771.42s)]
*  Then imagine scrolling on your phone one day only to discover that a fellow student wants to shoot up the kosher dining hall and, and I quote, gang rape all Jew pig woman on campus. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1774.42s)]
*  That is what my peers and I experienced last week when reading the multiple online threats made by a fellow student instructing other Cornell students to assault Jews on campus, to follow them home and slit their throats. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1786.42s)]
*  This was not just hate speech. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1799.42s)]
*  It was a call to action and an immediate threat. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1801.42s)]
*  The sentiment did not begin with that student. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1804.42s)]
*  Professors and student organizations have been fueling Jew hatred and spreading it across campus with disregard or potentially even with deliberate intent to incite. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1807.42s)]
*  Committee will be in order. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1821.42s)]
*  Committee will be in order. [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1823.42s)]
*  Apologize, Ms. Soberstein. You can continue. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1828.42s)]
*  And even after that students arrest professors have continued to teach blatant anti Israel lessons in their classrooms. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1830.42s)]
*  Students in the course race, racism and public policy reported that Professor Lindsay played a video in class claiming that Israel is committing apartheid in which students felt was an attempt to place blame for the terror attack on Israel. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1836.42s)]
*  Students in the writing seminar true stories taught by Professor Glowman reported that the professor suggested that Palestine is a textbook case of genocide and sought to pressure students who had previously expressed sympathy for Israel to change their views. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1850.42s)]
*  These not so subtle examples of bullying and attempts at indoctrination have a tangible impact on the pervasive Jew hatred spreading throughout my campus. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1865.42s)]
*  My grandmother, along with many of my family members and close friends live in Israel. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1874.42s)]
*  Why are they calling me every day to check in and see how I am doing? [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1880.42s)]
*  Do I feel safe on campus? Is there enough security? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1885.42s)]
*  Do other students know that I am Jewish? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1890.42s)]
*  They live in an active war zone with rockets constantly being fired at them. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1894.42s)]
*  And yet my safety on an American college campus is keeping them up at night. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1899.42s)]
*  Growing up with the first hand accounts of what my grandfather endured during the Holocaust, I could never comprehend how neighbors and friends stood by as Jews were rounded up to be killed and how governments around the world turned a blind eye until now. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1904.42s)]
*  Witnessing such unbridled and unapologetic anti-Semitism unfold on my college campus is a testament to the impacts of permitting Jew hatred to fester and infect the mob mentality of impressionable students. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1920.42s)]
*  It is shocking that college campuses have devolved into echo chambers, fostering animosity, aggression and bigotry, a shift that is painfully reminiscent of the vitriol and terror that my grandfather endured in the 1930s. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1931.42s)]
*  Anti-Semitism can no longer be hidden under the guise of anti-Zionism. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1944.42s)]
*  Disseminating lies about Israel is an effort to validate violence against Jews. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1949.42s)]
*  I am grateful for the supportive words from the Cornell administration, but actions speak louder than words. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1954.42s)]
*  We require tangible measures, including strict adherence to policies that forbid threatening or intimidating behaviors towards any student and ensures that purveyors of violence are removed from campus. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1959.42s)]
*  No student should ever live in fear for their safety, regardless of background or religion. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1970.42s)]
*  What is happening on Cornell's campus and across universities in this country is not about protecting expressions of free speech or free exchange of ideas. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1976.42s)]
*  It is about enabling and even promoting intimidation and the threat of harm to Jewish students and supporters of Israel. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1983.42s)]
*  It is imperative that decisive action is taken to ensure the collective safety of students. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1990.42s)]
*  Thank you for your time today. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=1995.42s)]

*  Chairman Jordan, ranking member Nadler, distinguished members, friends, brave students. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2008.42s)]
*  Thank you for conducting this important hearing today. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2014.42s)]
*  I am chairman of the Louis D. Brandeis Center for Human Rights Under Law and former head of the U.S. Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2018.42s)]
*  At the Louis D. Brandeis Center, we fight anti-Semitism on college campuses, and I appreciate the kind words from both the chairman and ranking members. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2025.42s)]
*  At the Louis D. Brandeis Center, we fight anti-Semitism on college campuses, and I appreciate the kind words from both the chairman and ranking member about the work that we're doing, more work than ever before. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2032.42s)]
*  I would have said, if this were October 6th, that we have never seen more anti-Semitism on college campuses than we were seeing on October 6th. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2042.42s)]
*  Our staff was stretched. We were getting more complaints on a daily basis than ever before and by far. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2052.42s)]
*  We look back with nostalgia at those days because in a week since October 7th, we're hearing from more students than we would in a month or more before October 6th. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2058.42s)]
*  Incidents have gone through the roof. Let's think about that. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2071.42s)]
*  We're talking about a situation in which there was mass murder of civilians, organized rape, torture, and desecration of corpses. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2075.42s)]
*  And the immediate reaction on many, many college campuses was for student organizations to go out and celebrate the murders, the rapes, the torture. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2085.42s)]
*  For so many students that we work with, and you may get a sense of this from the brave words that you've heard today from these students, [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2097.42s)]
*  what they're facing is an extraordinary shock and the difficulty of realizing that the masks are down and the students who they thought were their friends are celebrating murders of people just like them. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2105.42s)]
*  This is partly about... [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2121.42s)]
*  The committee will be in order. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2123.42s)]
*  This is an issue of speech and it's also an issue of civil rights. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2134.42s)]
*  Again and again we are seeing Jewish college students who are being prevented from expressing not only their viewpoints, but an integral part of their identity. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2139.42s)]
*  For many Jewish Americans, not all, but for many Jewish Americans, Zionism, a commitment to the Jewish state of Israel, is an important part of their identity. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2150.42s)]
*  And so when they are excluded as Zionists, they feel this as exclusion as Jews. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2160.42s)]
*  A rule against Zionists is a rule against Jews. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2168.42s)]
*  Even before October 7, we were finding that large numbers of college students, including strongly self-identified Jewish college students such as people who were living in Jewish fraternities and sororities, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2171.42s)]
*  were unwilling on a consistent basis to express their Jewish identity. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2183.42s)]
*  Majorities were saying that they sometimes felt it necessary to conceal their Jewish identity, including in particular their support for the state of Israel. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2189.42s)]
*  In many cases, we saw this not just as toxic hostile environments, but as specific actions to exclude Jewish students who have that as a part of their identity. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2198.42s)]
*  For instance, at Tufts and the University of Southern California, clients of the Brandeis Center were members of student government facing organized efforts to exclude them, to throw them out of student government because as Jews they support the state of Israel. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2209.42s)]
*  Similarly, this is difficult, but I have to say at SUNY New Paltz, we had two clients who were thrown out of a sexual assault survivors group because Zionism was an important part of their identity. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2225.42s)]
*  At the University of Vermont, similar issues as well as a book club in which one could not participate if one was a Zionist. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2242.42s)]
*  Here we found viewpoint discrimination, but not just viewpoint discrimination. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2249.42s)]
*  That is to say, people were shunned, marginalized, and excluded not just because of their political views, but because who they are and what their identity is as Jews. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2254.42s)]
*  At my own alma mater, the University of California at Berkeley School of Law, many student organizations, including law reviews, have adopted rules, including bylaws and changes to their constitutions that prevent anyone from speaking to their groups who is a Zionist or a supporter of the state of Israel. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2265.42s)]
*  And let me be clear, they were prevented from speaking and are to this day prevented from speaking on any topic. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2287.42s)]
*  This was not just a statement that if your viewpoint disagrees with us, we don't want to hear you. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2295.42s)]
*  This was, if you are a Zionist, we don't want to hear you on any topic. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2300.42s)]
*  If you are a feminist legal scholar, we don't want to hear you on feminist legal issues if you are a supporter of Israel, which is to say most Jewish Americans. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2305.42s)]

*  And managing that experience for young adults is a very hard work, is a very hard job for [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2832.06s)]
*  universities. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2838.2999999999997s)]

*  problems. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2859.18s)]
*  Now, just because speech is legal doesn't mean it can't be harmful. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2860.18s)]
*  And university presidents and deans have made crystal clear that anti-Semitism goes against [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2864.88s)]
*  their values. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2871.52s)]
*  Protecting expression also means making clear when it crosses a line into threats or harassment. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2873.6s)]
*  Support for Palestinian rights, solidarity with Palestinian suffering is not anti-Semitism. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2880.6400000000003s)]
*  It is not anti-Semitism to advocate for curing cancer either. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2889.2400000000002s)]
*  But when your advocacy turns into threats of violence, eliminationist speech, hostility [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2893.6s)]

*  protest permits, suspending perpetrators. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2916.58s)]
*  Schools have been working with law enforcement to have people arrested and to open investigations. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2919.5s)]
*  But that's not enough. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2924.58s)]
*  The anti-Semitism task forces that have announced, been announced in some schools can go deeper. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2926.62s)]
*  They can make transformative change across systems. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2933.06s)]
*  They can touch every aspect of student life and what they learn. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2937.7s)]
*  The national strategy to counter anti-Semitism did that kind of stock taking. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2941.78s)]
*  They spoke to a thousand community members and experts and it commits our government [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2947.28s)]
*  to serious action with time bound deadlines. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2953.46s)]
*  And federal agencies have already been fulfilling those commitments including some mentioned [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2957.32s)]
*  by my long time colleague Mr. Marcus. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2964.78s)]
*  In addition to the Department of Education, eight other federal agencies have affirmed [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2968.46s)]
*  in writing for the first time that Title VI bans anti-Semitic discrimination in all [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2973.98s)]
*  federally funded programs. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2980.58s)]

*  covered. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2987.82s)]
*  These changes and commitments are important and dramatic and meaningful. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2989.32s)]
*  And even the little actions matter. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2994.9s)]
*  Making a new complaint form so that it says on the form and makes clear that if you're [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=2997.22s)]
*  a Jew victim of harassment, you are covered. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3001.78s)]
*  Making information available in Hebrew and Yiddish for Orthodox Jews who walk to and [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3005.6600000000003s)]
*  from synagogue and face attacks. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3010.92s)]
*  They need to know their rights and they need to know what recourse is available to them. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3014.1400000000003s)]
*  And this strategy, those are just a few examples of why the action recommendations in this [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3019.46s)]
*  strategy are a real roadmap to stem the normalization of anti-Semitism. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3026.06s)]
*  It's got bipartisan, bicameral support and so many organizations rallied around and celebrated [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3032.48s)]
*  this strategy because it's such a serious plan. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3040.02s)]
*  So first, Congress should implement it if they're serious. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3044.18s)]
*  And second, by the time a student files a complaint to the Department of Education, [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3048.0s)]
*  we failed them. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3052.78s)]
*  Their peer networks have failed them. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3054.26s)]
*  Their school has failed them. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3056.42s)]
*  And now they will be making a complaint. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3058.6600000000003s)]
*  The number is what Mr. Mark has called through the roof. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3062.5800000000004s)]
*  They will send those complaints to a civil rights staff that is already processing a [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3067.1400000000003s)]
*  record number of complaints with less capacity. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3073.36s)]
*  So Congress should fund the Office of Civil Rights. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3076.46s)]
*  We don't want to get investigators in the chairs for the complaints that we know are [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3080.18s)]
*  going to be coming. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3083.62s)]
*  We are sad, but we don't want those students and families to wait. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3085.1s)]
*  And finally, it seems like the only thing communities and Congress can agree on is [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3089.5s)]
*  to fund security, and that's critical. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3095.54s)]
*  But we can't legislate, regulate, tabulate or barricade anti-Semitism out of our society. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3099.14s)]
*  Jews are saying loudly and clearly they feel alienated. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3106.2999999999997s)]
*  They feel alone. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3110.3399999999997s)]
*  They feel disappointed in their allies. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3111.54s)]
*  They want support. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3113.98s)]
*  Prevention and awareness building and community building aren't some kind of extra. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3115.74s)]
*  The Jewish community values those opportunities. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3122.74s)]
*  You should see how many groups are working with the U.S. Department of Agriculture that [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3126.08s)]
*  never did before. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3130.92s)]
*  We want these programs. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3132.4s)]
*  We want to engage in prevention. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3134.04s)]
*  And the Department of Justice, Civil Rights, Community Relations Service and those programs [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3136.86s)]
*  that we sometimes think of as an afterthought, they are essential to prevent these incidents [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3142.8s)]
*  before they escalate. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3148.72s)]
*  Jews are a small minority in this country, and we are targeted so disproportionately [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3151.38s)]
*  by hate violence. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3156.5s)]
*  That was true before October 7th. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3158.08s)]
*  It was true 10 years ago. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3160.38s)]
*  We don't have the luxury right now to be partisans of anything but our safety. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3163.18s)]
*  And right now, the national strategy is the best blueprint for action I have seen in 30 [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3168.68s)]
*  years of writing blueprints for action. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3174.2799999999997s)]

*  So the question isn't whether, but how quickly is Congress going to fund and implement it? [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3181.2999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3186.3599999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Ms. Burdett. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3187.3599999999997s)]
*  We will now proceed under the five-minute rule with questions. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3188.3599999999997s)]
*  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Issa, for five minutes. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3191.44s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3195.08s)]
*  The testimony today obviously is concerning. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3196.08s)]
*  I want to touch on a few points and then ask a couple of short questions. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3199.32s)]
*  I wish I had more time. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3203.36s)]
*  I grew up in a Jewish neighborhood. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3205.6s)]
*  I grew up at a time in which there were wars between Arabs and Jews in the region. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3207.84s)]
*  Those wars have ended. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3215.82s)]
*  When this war began, I was in Bahrain, a country that has signed diplomatic relations with [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3218.32s)]
*  Israel. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3223.6800000000003s)]
*  They didn't do it because the Palestinians were being treated well or ill-treated. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3224.6800000000003s)]
*  They did it because, in fact, Israel is a partner they wanted to have against Iran. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3230.96s)]
*  I'm going to say here today, and the protesters who have all been escorted out probably don't [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3237.6400000000003s)]
*  understand, but they are playing into the hands of Iran. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3243.0s)]
*  They are playing into the hands of the last major nation to be not just anti-Semitic, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3247.6s)]
*  but wanting to destroy the state of Israel and doing it in no small part by funding activities [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3254.24s)]
*  around places including college campuses. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3261.96s)]
*  So I'm going to agree partially with Ms. Burdette. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3265.6s)]
*  Yes, we need to fully fund. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3269.52s)]
*  We need to fully fund investigations into the funding that goes to anti-Semitism into [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3272.24s)]
*  a pattern that we see here today. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3280.2s)]
*  I want to say to all of you, both young Americans for Freedom and non-YAF members, thank you [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3284.2799999999997s)]
*  for standing up to be conservatives on campus and taking it, but particularly to Ms. Cybersyne, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3290.64s)]
*  I have a question for you. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3299.12s)]
*  You know the history of the Holocaust. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3303.0s)]
*  You know that before that terrible time and the mass murders, in fact, Jews had ducked [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3304.7599999999998s)]
*  their heads. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3313.56s)]
*  They had been forced to reduce or deny who they were. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3314.56s)]
*  Do you see that as a young Jew? [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3320.56s)]
*  Do you see that as a pattern that today we are at risk if we don't use the full power [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3322.48s)]
*  of civil rights to protect the right of people to have their religion, be proud of it, and [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3328.72s)]
*  be proud of all that goes with it? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3335.72s)]
*  Thank you for your question. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3338.2s)]
*  The history of the Jewish people is one of constant oppression and fear for our lives [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3342.6s)]
*  and for being persecuted for who we are. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3349.04s)]
*  And as I've mentioned, my grandfather experienced this throughout his life and most prominently [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3351.72s)]
*  in his childhood during the Holocaust and his suffering in Auschwitz, but we are seeing [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3356.4s)]
*  it very prevalent, especially on college campuses today. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3360.64s)]
*  And I never thought twice about putting on my Jewish star every day, about opening my [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3364.84s)]
*  computer with my Hebrew keyboard in class, but today I do think twice about that and [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3370.2000000000003s)]
*  the thought of being persecuted for who I am, being looked at differently and being [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3376.28s)]
*  discriminated against crosses my mind multiple times a day. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3380.7200000000003s)]
*  And I do see a positive path forward for us. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3385.04s)]
*  I think that Jews are, we are resilient, we are perseverant, and we will not stop shouting [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3388.72s)]
*  out and voicing our concerns and voicing our fear until it is dealt with. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3396.3199999999997s)]
*  And I really do appreciate you all considering this today. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3401.08s)]
*  Mr. Marcus, are you concerned that this movement is not just pro-Palestinian or just anti-Semitic [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3405.04s)]
*  but in fact massive amounts of dollars in support, not just here but globally, is in [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3415.24s)]
*  fact being spent coming from the very country who paid for the 5,000, now 10,000 plus rockets [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3421.7599999999998s)]
*  that have fallen on Israel that paid for those weapons and that continues to be virtually [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3429.7599999999998s)]
*  the sole funder of attempts to destabilize Israel and in fact led to the murder of more [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3434.56s)]
*  than 2,000 Israelis? [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3442.0s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman Issa, for your question and it is well put. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3444.48s)]
*  Yes, indeed, what we're seeing today, especially post-October 7, is not just harassment of [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3448.56s)]
*  Jewish students, although we're seeing that, and it certainly isn't just support of Palestine, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3455.6400000000003s)]
*  which in and of itself is simply a political view. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3461.88s)]
*  What we're seeing is a lethal hatred which may be supported by funds from other countries [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3464.44s)]
*  and to that extent, I believe we need to know, first, are colleges making the disclosures [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3470.32s)]
*  that are required by law and if not, are there appropriate sanctions being brought on them? [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3475.84s)]
*  Second, we need to know if funds are being brought in from abroad, what is the impact, [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3480.96s)]
*  not just on these groups but on university curricula, personnel and other decision making? [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3488.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, and you have our pledge, and my pledge particularly, to the two-pronged approach, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3494.16s)]
*  combat anti-Semitism using the power of this committee and particularly civil rights and [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3500.16s)]
*  look into and root out the continued foreign influence that may affect, not just here but [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3506.16s)]
*  around the world, anti-Semitism and anti-Israel. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3513.12s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3515.92s)]
*  I yield back. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3518.16s)]
*  The gentleman yields back. [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3519.16s)]
*  The chair now recognizes the ranking member from New York, Mr. Nader. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3520.16s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3523.3199999999997s)]
*  Ms. Burdette, do you agree that if Congressional Republicans really care about enforcing Title [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3524.3199999999997s)]
*  VI, they would support fully funding rather than trying to cut funding for the Office [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3529.72s)]
*  of Civil Rights at the Department of Education to ensure that the office is adequate staffing [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3534.48s)]
*  in anticipation of a surge in Title VI complaints? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3539.3599999999997s)]
*  I would say that anyone who cares about civil rights and enforcement against anti-Semitic [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3543.44s)]
*  actions should fund that office. [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3549.68s)]
*  Ms. Burdette, was the Office for Civil Rights already inundated with complaints of anti-Semitism [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3553.8799999999997s)]
*  and Islamophobia before October 7th? [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3559.3599999999997s)]
*  They had their record year of complaints in 2016, I'm sorry to say, and that record was [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3562.56s)]
*  broken in 2022 at almost 19,000 complaints. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3570.7999999999997s)]
*  They have worked through them, but they are working with, I think, 12% less staff, so [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3576.86s)]
*  it just doesn't make any sense at all. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3584.82s)]
*  What happened after October 7th? [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3587.1400000000003s)]
*  After October 7th, we already know from NGOs like the one cited, where my professional [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3589.38s)]
*  alma mater, ADL, talking about hundreds of percent increase, but if you ask Mr. Nadler, [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3596.9s)]
*  the NYPD, they, even reports coming to them in just three weeks have been skyrocketing, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3604.18s)]
*  and when you compare it to an average month of October, there are three times as many [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3612.8199999999997s)]
*  incidents, and I'm sure police departments in a lot of congressional districts would [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3618.94s)]
*  say the same. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3623.14s)]
*  And what do you think will happen going forward? [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3624.62s)]
*  We know that every time Israel is in the headlines, unfortunately attacks against Jews go up. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3629.34s)]
*  So inappropriate. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3636.42s)]
*  There's no war, there's no conflict, there's no injustice that entitles someone to punch [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3637.42s)]
*  their neighbor in the face, to spit at them, and all the things we've heard here from these [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3643.08s)]
*  students. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3647.26s)]
*  I think that this war won't be a six-day war. [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3648.46s)]
*  This conflict, the tension on campus is going to take a very long time to work through. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3652.82s)]
*  It's really a work in progress, and I think we're going to be dealing with these incidents [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3659.5s)]
*  for a long time. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3663.1400000000003s)]
*  That's why I mentioned the Community Relations Service. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3664.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know if we think about it every day, but those civil rights tools and instruments [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3667.5s)]
*  and outreach programs that we have, they're going to work first. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3673.42s)]
*  The universities and those programs have the ability to help Ms. Silberstein right [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3678.58s)]
*  now without a law and without a markup. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3684.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3688.46s)]
*  Professor Nadel and Ms. Burdette, in your testimony you noted the White House's national [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3689.46s)]
*  strategy to counter anti-Semitism. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3693.42s)]
*  For the record, I would also note that the White House is also pursuing an analogous [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3695.1s)]
*  national strategy to counter Islamophobia. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3699.86s)]
*  To the extent you are able, can you explain the national strategy to counter anti-Semitism [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3702.06s)]
*  and highlight why you think it's valuable and effective? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3707.58s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3711.38s)]
*  Thank you for your question. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3712.72s)]
*  I was one of the 1,000 people that the White House talked to as they were developing the [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3714.7s)]
*  national strategy to counter anti-Semitism. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3719.9s)]
*  This is an extraordinary document. [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3723.42s)]
*  It runs to, I don't know, 60, 70 pages, and it is filled with recommendations about what [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3726.18s)]
*  be done to respond to anti-Semitism in different venues and in different agencies in the United [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3733.62s)]
*  States government. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3741.54s)]
*  As I said in my opening remarks, I know of no country that has ever developed such a [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3742.8199999999997s)]
*  strategy and believe me, as we know from the testimony of Ms. Silberstein, we know that [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3748.02s)]
*  other countries could have developed this if they had the goodwill to do so. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3753.58s)]
*  For example, it talks about, as Ms. Burdette was talking about, it talks about what should [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3757.98s)]
*  be done in the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3764.22s)]
*  Since the Obama administration, Title VI has protected Jewish students under Title VI by [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3769.26s)]

*  I feel like we're talking about college campuses right now, and we really should be talking [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3924.04s)]

*  By the time students get to college campuses, they have certain views and oftentimes ingrained [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3933.44s)]

*  Isn't our K-12 system really letting down the concept that we have in America for free [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3956.36s)]
*  speech but also for responsible free speech, for speech that doesn't include hate? [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3965.72s)]
*  Congressman, I would like to be able to tell you that you don't need to worry that this [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3971.7200000000003s)]
*  is just a campus problem, but the fact is that it is not. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3974.84s)]
*  K-12 is important not only because of the attitudes that students develop and bring [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3978.4s)]
*  to college, but also because there are increasing issues that we see currently in public elementary [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3983.92s)]
*  and secondary school, including any number of different forms of discrimination. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3989.4s)]
*  We see that especially in certain schools, especially on the West Coast, that have a [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3994.66s)]
*  particular form of ethnic studies, which unfortunately has involved some degree of [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=3999.44s)]
*  anti-Semitic stereotypes and defamations. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4004.92s)]
*  There are things that educators can do to address this. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4007.76s)]
*  Certainly there are more school districts that are incorporating Holocaust education [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4011.0s)]
*  into their programming, but what studies are showing is that Holocaust education isn't [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4014.9s)]
*  necessarily sufficient in that it's better to have also education into the ways in which [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4019.28s)]
*  anti-Semitism manifests itself today. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4024.36s)]
*  So that sort of programming is important, but more than that, I do think we need to [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4027.64s)]
*  have more attention than we have been about the increasing problem of anti-Semitism also [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4032.08s)]
*  in K-12 schools. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4037.54s)]
*  You mentioned funding from other countries. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4040.2s)]
*  Do you have any direct evidence of funding from other countries? [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4042.7999999999997s)]
*  Because I honestly believe that it goes on in a lot of different areas. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4045.68s)]
*  One of the great things about America is we're open, and one of the great vulnerabilities [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4049.0s)]
*  we have is that we're open and social media is being used to manipulate us in a lot of [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4052.3599999999997s)]
*  different ways. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4057.36s)]
*  Do you have any evidence that Iran or any other foreign country is using our social [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4058.36s)]
*  media in this country to promote anti-Semitism? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4064.2s)]
*  During the Trump administration, the Department of Education revealed various kinds of evidence [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4069.56s)]
*  that there were not just significant contributions coming from the Gulf states and elsewhere [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4073.84s)]
*  in the world, but also contributions that were not disclosed as required by law. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4079.12s)]
*  And these are to college campuses? [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4083.72s)]
*  To colleges and universities. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4085.92s)]
*  And I believe there was also an effort by the Chinese Communist Party to establish groups [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4087.2000000000003s)]
*  on campuses. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4095.48s)]
*  The Confucius Center, I think they were often called. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4097.04s)]
*  That's right. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4100.72s)]
*  But if I may, Congressman, the problem is also going the other way around, which is [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4101.72s)]
*  to say the increasing perception that there may be support from college campuses for terrorism [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4105.28s)]
*  abroad, not just money coming one way, but support coming the other. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4110.88s)]
*  You're not suggesting that colleges are supporting terrorism abroad, but students or professors [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4115.32s)]
*  on college campuses are supporting terrorism? [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4120.28s)]
*  There are student groups who have indicated that they are not just in favor of the same [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4123.719999999999s)]
*  issues as Hamas, but that they are part of that movement. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4129.32s)]
*  And there is a point at which under federal terrorism law that promoting the program and [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4133.679999999999s)]
*  agenda and ideas of a U.S. State Department designated terrorist organization may constitute [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4139.54s)]
*  material support for terrorism. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4146.0199999999995s)]
*  So where do we draw the line between speech and where it crosses the line? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4147.94s)]
*  The Supreme Court has made clear that anything that encourages violence, and I'm not using [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4154.66s)]
*  the technical words, but crosses the line. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4159.38s)]
*  Is anti-Semitic speech by itself a violation of the First Amendment? [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4164.179999999999s)]
*  In the case of support for terrorism, of course, under the holder. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4171.66s)]
*  Absolutely. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4174.66s)]
*  But I'm just suggesting we have hateful speech all around, and it's offensive. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4175.66s)]
*  And frankly, I want to be the first, as all my colleagues on this committee are, to condemn [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4180.98s)]
*  anti-Semitism and Islamophobia and racism and anti-Christian speech. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4186.099999999999s)]
*  It's terrible, it's hateful, it shouldn't be in this marketplace of ideas that we have. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4193.42s)]
*  But is it without threats of violence, is that speech a violation of the First Amendment? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4198.18s)]
*  What I would say to you, Congressman, is that the Supreme Court has properly been protective [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4205.660000000001s)]
*  of a wide range of speech, including much speech that we would describe as hate speech. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4210.06s)]
*  However, what we are seeing over and over again on college campuses is that where you [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4215.42s)]
*  see intense anti-Jewish hate speech, you will almost always also find hateful conduct. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4221.099999999999s)]
*  Hateful conduct, not just words, it can be assault, it could be exclusion, it's happening [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4228.7s)]
*  over and over again. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4234.58s)]
*  So in order to address the anti-Semitism, I think that there is sufficient conduct we [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4236.0599999999995s)]
*  need to go after. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4240.78s)]
*  In terms of speech, I think there should be the same protections regarding speech in this [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4241.82s)]
*  area as in any others. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4245.82s)]
*  I yield back. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4247.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4248.42s)]
*  We now recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Johnson. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4249.5s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4252.74s)]
*  The chairman, when he showed his video this morning, we witnessed in that video someone [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4257.78s)]
*  asking the question, is free speech dead on campus? [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4265.64s)]
*  I think that question applies to Congress. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4270.46s)]
*  It's ironic that we're holding this hearing today about censorship and speech on campus. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4274.58s)]
*  But last night, MAGA Republicans and others censured the only Palestinian voice in the [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4283.9s)]
*  House of Representatives because they didn't like what she had to say. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4292.74s)]
*  She didn't threaten anybody. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4297.04s)]
*  She did not advocate for violence. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4298.5599999999995s)]
*  She stated a view as happens on college campuses, it happens across the country. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4302.7s)]
*  We have freedom of speech in this country. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4309.0199999999995s)]
*  But she was censured last night for exercising her First Amendment right to freedom of speech. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4311.66s)]
*  And we're not setting a very good example here in Congress. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4319.099999999999s)]
*  We are all reeling from the situation in the Middle East. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4323.8s)]

*  a safe college learning environment free from threats of violence and discrimination. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4343.5s)]
*  It should go without saying that threatening violence against people because of who they [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4349.3s)]

*  think that criticism of the government of Israel is always anti-Semitic, or does it [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4433.52s)]

*  Thank you for your question. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4444.92s)]
*  As a historian, I think everything depends on context. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4446.6s)]
*  I think we always need to think more broadly. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4450.72s)]
*  It's very clear the criticism of the government of Israel is not ipso facto anti-Semitic. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4453.4800000000005s)]
*  If it were, hundreds of thousands of Israelis who he had watched in the past months turning [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4459.92s)]
*  out to throng the streets of Tel Aviv and of every city and hamlet in Israel would have [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4465.6s)]
*  been seen as anti-Semitic. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4472.6s)]
*  So criticism of the government's policies is not by itself anti-Semitic. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4473.9800000000005s)]
*  However, what is anti-Semitic is absolutely is to deny the Jews the right of self-determination, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4478.84s)]
*  a right that is internationally protected, and to call for the destruction of the state [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4485.44s)]

*  has coursed across American history. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4526.88s)]

*  she was afraid it would be attacked. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4581.8s)]

*  It's a judiciary hearing about speech. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4609.08s)]
*  In that vein, I am reminded of the great words of the philosopher Austin Powers who said, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4612.28s)]
*  there's only two things I can't stand, people who are intolerant of other people and the [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4618.76s)]
*  Dutch. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4624.32s)]
*  A similar tension seems to be on display today because on one side of the witness table, [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4625.76s)]
*  we have people saying we have speech that we would like to have vindicated and we are [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4632.26s)]
*  under this tremendous pressure from these entities that offer a heckler's veto of what [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4636.88s)]
*  we're trying to get out. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4642.16s)]
*  And then on the other side of the table, you have people saying, well, there's speech we [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4643.52s)]
*  really don't like that's anti-Semitic and problematic and we've got to figure out ways [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4646.68s)]
*  to root it out. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4651.04s)]
*  There is an inherent tension in having that discussion on those terms. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4652.72s)]
*  And increasingly, it feels as though if we like speech, then any effort to constrain [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4657.72s)]
*  that speech is really problematic and the committee needs to explore it. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4663.08s)]
*  And if we don't like speech, we're increasingly censuring it on the House floor. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4667.64s)]
*  We're increasingly confronting it on pretty negative terms. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4673.24s)]
*  So I guess I want to just go through some of the statements some of our witnesses made. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4677.8s)]
*  So Mr. Marcus, a celebration of what happened on October 7th, let me let me disclaim, is [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4684.5199999999995s)]
*  offensive, horrid, but is it constitutionally protected speech? [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4691.98s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4699.58s)]
*  It may be, but it depends. [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4700.98s)]
*  And I'll give you an example. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4703.86s)]
*  If you say I'm going to celebrate Hamas and then you celebrate them by giving a big talk, [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4706.4s)]
*  doing a little dance, that can be deeply offensive and protected. [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4713.459999999999s)]
*  But if you say I celebrate Hamas, I am part of Hamas, their mission is my mission, and [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4719.98s)]
*  I will do what I can to advance them, that may be material support for terrorism, depending [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4729.86s)]
*  on what exactly you do. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4736.799999999999s)]
*  No, I think that's right. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4738.74s)]
*  But what you focused on there is the conduct. [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4739.9s)]
*  I think that was a really good explanation and parsing of it because speech is different [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4742.5s)]
*  than conduct. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4747.219999999999s)]
*  If someone says I associate with this known terrorist movement, then that association [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4748.22s)]
*  has more sort of a conduct flavor than someone saying I think what happened on October 7th [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4753.26s)]
*  was good. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4758.34s)]
*  Right? [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4759.34s)]
*  So I think that's right, Congressman, but with one caveat from the law interpreting [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4760.34s)]
*  the Terrorism Act, which is the following. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4766.42s)]
*  Material support doesn't need to be dollars, it could be guns, it doesn't need to be guns, [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4769.900000000001s)]
*  and it can be the sort of PR activity that could be done by a commercial firm. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4774.74s)]
*  Man, see that's the thing, PR activity sounds a lot like people talking. [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4781.74s)]
*  And so I just think we ought to be careful with that, but I do want to move on because [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4786.34s)]
*  I think it was Dr. Nadel. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4790.42s)]
*  Is it possible to criticize George Soros without being anti-Semitic? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4793.0199999999995s)]
*  I don't know all the tropes that people use to associate with George Soros, but when they [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4799.76s)]
*  talk about a... [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4804.92s)]
*  No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, not when they talk about someone else. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4806.360000000001s)]
*  Is criticism against George Soros ever not anti-Semitic? [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4810.04s)]
*  That's the question. [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4815.84s)]
*  Ms. Burdette is offered to answer that. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4819.52s)]
*  No, no, but you mentioned Mr. Soros. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4820.96s)]
*  I want you to answer this. [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4821.96s)]
*  Obviously, you want me to. [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4822.96s)]
*  There's no phone a friend here in the Judiciary Committee. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4823.96s)]
*  What has happened in the United States is that we use different code words to disguise... [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4828.36s)]
*  Right, no, that's not the question. [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4834.08s)]
*  No, wait, I'm answering your question. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4835.08s)]
*  We use different code words to disguise anti-Semitism. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4837.679999999999s)]
*  And so Soros has become the code word that replaced Rothschild, that replaced Shiloh. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4842.36s)]
*  But is it possible to criticize him without being anti-Semitic, yes or no? [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4847.32s)]
*  I don't know the context. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4851.2s)]
*  I'm not going to talk without knowing the context. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4852.48s)]
*  That is just an astonishing thing. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4854.5199999999995s)]
*  And similarly, you said any critique of globalism is anti-Semitic. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4856.36s)]
*  Now that really is an Austin Powers... [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4860.5199999999995s)]
*  No, what I said was that the word globalist, I didn't say any critique of globalism. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4862.12s)]
*  What I said was the word globalist had become the new code word for the internationalist [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4866.5599999999995s)]
*  code word from the previous period. [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4872.92s)]
*  You ascribe that motive. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4875.12s)]
*  See, when I criticize globalism, I'm often criticizing the UN, which then in turn goes [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4876.5199999999995s)]
*  around and criticizes Israel. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4883.0s)]
*  So if critiquing a globalist entity that criticizes Israel is anti-Semitic... [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4885.48s)]
*  So why use the word globalist instead of the UN? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4892.48s)]
*  Well, because the UN's goals are to have a global order over things that deprive countries [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4895.36s)]
*  of their sovereignty. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4899.94s)]
*  One of those countries is Israel. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4901.04s)]
*  That is the great hypocrisy of what I think is frankly a reverse trope that any criticism [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4903.5199999999995s)]
*  of Soros or any criticism of globalism is somehow anti-Semitic. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4908.799999999999s)]
*  Sometimes they're just criticisms of Soros and of globalism. [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4912.98s)]
*  But I see my time's expired and I yield back. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4916.259999999999s)]
*  I thank the gentleman and yield back. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4918.5s)]

*  the burning families alive, families clutching each other, lying in bed as they were machine [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4953.58s)]
*  gunned. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4957.900000000001s)]
*  And I asked myself, how is it possible that people could commit such acts of barbarism? [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4960.46s)]
*  And I think I probably speak for many in the Jewish community when I say that as horrifying [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4967.38s)]
*  and traumatizing it was to witness that. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4973.82s)]
*  It was, it amplified the pain to see the reaction, the almost immediate reaction in the United [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4979.54s)]
*  States and around the world was to not condemn the butchers, but to condemn the victims, [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4988.14s)]
*  to celebrate Hamas's acts of unbridled terror. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=4998.42s)]
*  And then I asked myself a different question. [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5004.9800000000005s)]
*  How is it possible that people could justify the butchery of whole families, the [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5006.900000000001s)]
*  wanton deliberate violence directed against these innocent civilians? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5017.98s)]
*  How could that be celebrated? [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5023.259999999999s)]
*  And I don't think it can be celebrated unless you view Israeli life, unless you view Jewish [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5028.139999999999s)]
*  life as somehow less than a human life. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5037.219999999999s)]
*  We spend a lot of time debating the definition of anti-Semitism. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5043.179999999999s)]
*  I'm not sure I could give you a clear analytic answer to that question, but seems to me at [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5047.34s)]
*  its most basic viewing Jewish life as less than human life is the very definition of [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5054.9800000000005s)]
*  anti-Semitism, or it's certainly anti-Semitism in its most extreme form. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5062.9400000000005s)]
*  And what I see happening on college campuses with the glorification with people talking [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5069.26s)]
*  about how empowered they felt at seeing women butchered peace activists mowed down. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5074.22s)]
*  The fact that many Jewish students don't feel comfortable expressing their Jewish identity. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5085.9800000000005s)]
*  At a time of their lives when they should be free to discuss whatever issues they want, [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5097.18s)]
*  free to be themselves, is just horrifying. [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5103.5s)]
*  I remember years ago talking to the president of the Jewish community in France at a time [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5108.14s)]
*  when many Jews were leaving France because they didn't feel safe there. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5114.06s)]
*  And he told me the French government was doing what they could to protect the Jewish [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5118.26s)]
*  community, but who wanted to live in a country that where you needed protection? [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5121.46s)]
*  And I remember thinking years ago, thank God, that's not the case in the United States, [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5125.06s)]
*  but now it is the case. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5128.26s)]
*  And not for Jews alone, we've seen a horrific rise of Islamophobia. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5129.34s)]
*  Even as we mourn the death of an older Jewish man in Los Angeles who died when struck at a protest, [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5138.9400000000005s)]
*  we mourn the loss of a six-year-old Muslim child. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5148.38s)]
*  It's just horrifying. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5159.34s)]
*  Dr. Nadel, I'd be interested in your thoughts on how you see anti-Semitism today. [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5169.82s)]
*  How is it different in character than what we've seen in the past? [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5177.5s)]
*  Ms. Burdett, I'd be interested in your thoughts on how hate online leaps into the real world [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5181.26s)]
*  and what we might do to combat that. [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5188.38s)]
*  The anti-Semitism that we see today since you closed with hate online is horrifically magnified [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5191.82s)]
*  in a way that has never been this magnified before because it is you can reach millions [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5199.1s)]
*  and millions of people by expressing anti-Semitic ideas, including all of these old ideas about Jews [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5205.42s)]
*  as internationalists and old ideas about Jews as corrupted by money. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5212.94s)]
*  And so what we have in this moment in time is we have millions of people, [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5218.62s)]
*  especially when leading personalities, whether they are members of the government [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5225.42s)]
*  or they are entertainment figures, when they post these kinds of anti-Semitic messages [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5230.0599999999995s)]
*  and then it just explodes. [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5236.0599999999995s)]
*  It goes viral. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5238.22s)]
*  I don't spend time looking at the social media because I think you could just spend all your [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5239.5s)]
*  time doing it, but I had a student last semester in my course, anti-Semitism, enduring hatred, [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5243.74s)]
*  who told me that she had spent the previous week 40 hours looking at TikTok videos. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5248.3s)]
*  So I looked at her, I said, when did you ever do any of your schoolwork? [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5254.94s)]
*  And I was a little concerned. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5258.06s)]
*  But the point is, is that anti-Semitism is magnified in a way today because of social media [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5259.82s)]
*  that was just unimaginable in earlier eras. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5266.3s)]
*  I thank the gentleman. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5270.3s)]
*  We now recognize the gentleman from Arizona, Mr. Biggs. [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5272.46s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5275.1s)]
*  Thank you for our panelists, for all of you being here today. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5275.900000000001s)]
*  Appreciate it very much. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5279.1s)]
*  So I just want to point out to my friend from Georgia who has left the room that apparently [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5282.22s)]
*  22 MAGA Democrats also voted in favor of the censure resolution last night. [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5289.26s)]
*  So I think that's important to get out. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5294.54s)]
*  But be that as it may, I want to just kind of get into some of this. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5296.38s)]
*  We'll deal with some of the anti-Semitism. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5305.34s)]
*  We'll talk also about the anti-conservative bias in education. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5307.18s)]
*  So I'm going to give you two personal examples. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5313.34s)]
*  Number one, I belong to a church. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5315.18s)]
*  I think it's the only American church that's ever been actually an exterminated, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5317.82s)]
*  an extermination order was issued on by a governor, Governor Lilburn Boggs of Missouri, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5323.26s)]
*  to actually give license to kill members of my religion over 150 years ago. [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5328.62s)]
*  I could, you know, a little bit. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5336.06s)]
*  The other thing is just to relate to this, we talked about the UN just a moment ago. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5341.66s)]
*  So at 40 years old, having practiced law and tried literally hundreds of cases, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5348.78s)]
*  actually representing NGOs at the United Nations and other multilateral institutions, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5356.46s)]
*  by the way, there is no other organization I know that is so openly, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5360.139999999999s)]
*  you know, anti-Semitic in my opinion than the UN. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5367.98s)]
*  The Israeli representative was constantly ostracized and ignored and maltreated in my opinion. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5371.34s)]
*  Anyways, so I went to decide to go back because, you know, being a lawyer at the international level, [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5383.0199999999995s)]
*  that was good, but being a PhD at the international level and a lawyer, [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5387.74s)]
*  really got a lot of credence. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5393.42s)]
*  So I decided to go back to get to my degree. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5394.78s)]
*  Unafraid, very conservative, but the one thing I know is when I was on that campus in Arizona, [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5398.62s)]
*  by the way, somebody mentioned that I was graduated from elite universities. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5408.54s)]
*  I can't wait to tell ASU and U of A and BYU, they're considered elite by some congressional [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5412.38s)]
*  witnesses. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5417.82s)]
*  But the point is, as I was there, I had to duck and hide my beliefs because the professors [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5418.62s)]
*  they held you. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5430.54s)]
*  You sit in a master's degree or PhD class in seminar, how could I express my thoughts [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5432.139999999999s)]
*  knowing that a grade below a B because a professor disagrees with me? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5440.0599999999995s)]
*  And I experienced that. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5448.219999999999s)]
*  They control your destiny. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5450.139999999999s)]
*  So I want to ask about to our three students, tell us a little bit, we'll start with you, [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5453.82s)]
*  Ms. Silverstein, Ms. Jordan, and Mr. Agrizdek, is that how you say it close enough? [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5461.5s)]
*  A little bit about whether the administration or the institutional, [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5468.139999999999s)]
*  or the institution of whether it's Cornell, Iowa, or Buffalo, did anything to [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5473.42s)]
*  hinder your identity as a student or your beliefs or your, let's just go with that. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5479.9s)]
*  Thank you, Congressman. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5489.02s)]
*  As for Cornell, in the case of antisemitism, following the massacre on October 7th, [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5491.18s)]
*  President Pollock issued a statement in which she essentially conflated the horrific massacre [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5498.14s)]
*  of Jews on that day with various natural disasters occurring in the world, such as an earthquake in [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5504.780000000001s)]
*  Afghanistan, which was extremely baffling, tone deaf, and insensitive, and truly hurtful to the [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5510.860000000001s)]
*  Jewish community on campus. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5519.660000000001s)]
*  Now, many incidents, as I've mentioned, have occurred since then in which the Jewish students [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5521.42s)]
*  at Cornell have been threatened repeatedly, most recently with a student's comments posted [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5527.42s)]
*  online to directly go after and attack students. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5534.38s)]
*  So when we have a threat, that is not protected speech, that is criminal speech. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5538.06s)]
*  Was there criminal prosecution investigation or arrest made in that case? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5542.9400000000005s)]
*  In the case of the student who was just arrested? [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5547.66s)]
*  Yes, tell us about it. [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5550.38s)]
*  Yeah, so he, this student was arrested, I believe, last week, and he was arraigned. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5551.1s)]
*  He is currently being held, and his parents claim that he made these comments due to his [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5556.78s)]
*  mental health issues. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5565.259999999999s)]
*  But regardless of any, you know, mental health issues that could have caused these statements, [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5567.34s)]
*  it's evident that the sentiment created on campus by professors and students alike of [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5573.34s)]
*  pervasive and just widespread anti-Semitism and anti-Israel rhetoric has created such an atmosphere [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5580.22s)]
*  that has enabled him to make these comments, and that really fuels the fire within many students [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5587.18s)]
*  who may feel hostile to Israel to attack Jews because of it. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5593.26s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, my, while my time has expired, I ask the questions of those. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5598.780000000001s)]
*  May they respond to it? [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5602.38s)]
*  Thank you for your question. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5606.780000000001s)]
*  So our flyers have been torn down, our chalk is washed away, and we even had an advertisement [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5608.3s)]
*  sign for one of our speakers, Chloe Cole, stolen, and the police recovered the sign, [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5613.66s)]
*  but they didn't figure out, I guess, who took the poster. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5618.14s)]
*  We never received that back. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5621.58s)]
*  And this stuff has been ongoing, continues to go on, and it's obviously showing that [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5623.26s)]
*  there is an equal opportunity for our speech. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5630.54s)]
*  The left-leaning students groups, they get their posters, like, theirs are literally [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5633.820000000001s)]
*  right next to ours. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5638.06s)]
*  You can see the remnants of the tape and our poster design is still there, but then their [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5638.700000000001s)]
*  posters are completely un-attacked. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5644.06s)]
*  And I have met with the university president, I have met with other staff members to discuss [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5645.9800000000005s)]
*  this, and it just seems like there's no move towards change. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5650.700000000001s)]
*  I have asked, I was like, okay, what can we do to at least let our messages heard so we [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5654.3s)]
*  can have people attend our events and hear different points of view, and I still haven't [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5657.740000000001s)]
*  received any other options. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5662.780000000001s)]
*  It's a shame that we have to have different things be done so that we can have our speech [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5664.9400000000005s)]
*  heard. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5672.78s)]
*  We should have equal opportunity to have our flyers up, just like their left-leaning students. [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5673.26s)]
*  We should have equal opportunity for our chalk to be un-erased so that we should have to [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5678.9400000000005s)]
*  do something different. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5683.9800000000005s)]
*  And also, all these actions that these students are doing violates school policy. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5685.58s)]
*  It's very clear in the handbook, and again, it still keeps happening, so I just would [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5691.42s)]
*  like to see something positive, like just us being able to stay represented without [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5696.62s)]
*  being hindered. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5703.9800000000005s)]
*  Thank you for your question. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5709.02s)]
*  I was very fortunate myself to not face any academic penalty while I was still enrolled [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5710.46s)]
*  at the university. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5715.26s)]
*  However, I was also a biological sciences major, oftentimes political topics stayed [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5716.3s)]
*  outside the classroom. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5720.7s)]
*  However, we did have those three professors that I had mentioned in my opening statement [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5721.74s)]
*  circulating the petition, heavily protesting our micro-noels event, calling for it to get [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5727.98s)]
*  shut down. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5733.26s)]
*  So I do recognize as well that while I was lucky, I did not have these professors in [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5733.74s)]
*  class. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5740.38s)]
*  I recognize other students may not be quite so lucky. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5740.78s)]
*  Additionally, it was very obvious that the protest following our Allen West lecture [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5744.94s)]
*  was mishandled. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5751.98s)]
*  There was danger posed to students. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5753.66s)]
*  This was widely documented through police reports, yet there was no apology from any [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5755.66s)]
*  university officials. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5760.3s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5761.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5762.94s)]

*  The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California for five minutes. [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5764.38s)]
*  Ms. Burdett, you are an expert on anti-Semitism, and I want to read a few different statements [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5767.42s)]
*  to you. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5773.9s)]
*  And if you can just give me a yes or no as to whether you would consider them anti-Semitic. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5774.3s)]
*  I prefer my kids knew Hanukkah from Kwanzaa. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5779.42s)]
*  At least it will come with some financial engineering, anti-Semitic or not. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5782.14s)]
*  Very potentially. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5786.78s)]
*  I just think that's what they're about is making money in a reference to Jared Kushner [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5788.62s)]
*  and his Jewish family. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5793.820000000001s)]
*  You think that's anti-Semitic? [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5795.18s)]

*  When I say Jew, I mean the 12 lost tribes of Judah, the blood of Christ, who the people [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5805.42s)]
*  known as the race black really are. [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5810.38s)]

*  Anti-Semitic or not. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5814.22s)]
*  A little too confusing for me to decipher. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5816.62s)]
*  We'll get to that. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5818.86s)]
*  This ain't a game. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5820.46s)]
*  I'm going to use you as an example to show you the Jewish people that told you to call [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5821.58s)]
*  me that no one can threaten or influence me. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5826.06s)]

*  Now going to get you some business. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5830.139999999999s)]
*  Still confusing? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5832.46s)]
*  Uses two stereotypes about Jews as being motivated only by business and having nefarious [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5835.5s)]
*  control that isn't real. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5843.42s)]
*  Last one. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5846.0599999999995s)]

*  The funny thing is I actually can't be anti-Semitic because black people are actually [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5852.299999999999s)]
*  Jew. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5856.22s)]
*  Also, you guys have toyed with me and tried to blackball anyone who opposes your agenda. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5856.780000000001s)]
*  What do you think about that one? [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5861.18s)]
*  Anti-Semitic. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5862.3s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is that we have anti-Semitic posts coming from this committee. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5864.06s)]
*  Last October, the chairman tweeted out on October 6, Kanye, Elon, Trump. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5873.42s)]
*  Those five statements that I just read to you were from Kanye West, who had made a number [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5880.22s)]
*  of anti-Semitic statements before this tweet was put up and then made the DEF CON statement [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5885.9s)]
*  about a day after the tweet was put up. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5892.0599999999995s)]
*  I, the chairman at the time, Chairman Nadler, many people in the Jewish community, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5894.379999999999s)]
*  asked the chairman, Chairman Jordan, to take this down. [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5899.82s)]
*  And it wasn't just members of Congress. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5904.139999999999s)]
*  It was nonpartisan Jewish organizations who said Kanye West is anti-Semitic. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5906.0599999999995s)]
*  I don't know what you're doing, but please do not give him a platform by leaving this [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5911.099999999999s)]
*  tweet up. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5915.179999999999s)]
*  It stayed up for months. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5916.46s)]
*  Defiantly, the chairman kept this tweet up. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5918.379999999999s)]
*  So, Mr. Chairman, I want to be just today your accountability partner, your online [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5921.74s)]
*  accountability partner, and just go through your social media. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5926.62s)]
*  Because if we're going to have a hearing about anti-Semitism, we can't allow a tweet like [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5929.42s)]
*  this to be posted on our side or your side. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5934.219999999999s)]
*  In 2019, Chairman Jordan also tweeted at Tom Steyer and used the dollar sign for Steyer. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5937.5s)]
*  Again, known Jewish philanthropist playing into what Ms. Burdette mentioned earlier, [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5946.78s)]
*  tropes about Jewish people and money. [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5951.9s)]
*  So, this committee should have a conversation and a hearing about anti-Semitism. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5955.58s)]
*  But I would first insist that the chairman, I don't know why he put this tweet up, either [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5962.0599999999995s)]
*  he believes it, which I hope is not the case, or he just wanted to own the libs. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5967.58s)]
*  And if that's what you're doing, you're hurting a lot of people by keeping that tweet up for [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5973.26s)]
*  so long, especially knowing what it represents. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5977.5s)]
*  And if we're talking about being your online accountability partner, Chairman, you still [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5980.139999999999s)]
*  have a subpoena in your inbox that's about 500 days old. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5984.46s)]
*  And with that, I'll yield back. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5987.82s)]
*  The gentleman yields back. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5990.7s)]
*  The chairman, I recognize the gentleman from California, Mr. McClintock. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5991.74s)]
*  First, does the chairman wish to dignify that with a response? [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5997.0199999999995s)]
*  No, I don't. [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=5999.82s)]
*  I yield time. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6000.3s)]
*  It seems to me there are only two ways I know of to resolve our differences as human beings. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6001.74s)]
*  There's reason and there's force. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6007.9s)]
*  I don't know of any other way. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6010.62s)]
*  The American founders established an empire of reason and democracy. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6012.54s)]
*  Freedom of speech is the beating heart of democracy. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6017.42s)]
*  In fact, the sole purpose of this building and the others like it in this complex is [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6020.78s)]
*  solely to talk out our differences and resolve them. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6025.98s)]
*  It seems to me there's only one way to separate truth from lies or wisdom from folly, [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6030.86s)]
*  and that's to expose one to the other and then trust the people to sort out the difference. [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6036.86s)]
*  That's our entire form of government is based on that. [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6041.339999999999s)]
*  Speech can be ugly. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6045.82s)]
*  It can be disgusting, hateful, prejudiced, alarming, but it can never be dangerous to [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6047.179999999999s)]
*  a free society as long as men and women of goodwill have the freedom to dispute it, [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6053.9s)]
*  to challenge it, and to reject it. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6059.820000000001s)]
*  I've never been comfortable with this concept of hate speech simply because it's always [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6063.18s)]
*  seemed to be a very short step between banning hate speech and banning speech we hate. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6068.14s)]
*  Mr. Marcus, this chant from the river to the sea, that clearly calls for the eradication [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6075.66s)]
*  of Israel. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6084.54s)]
*  It is genocidal at its roots. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6085.26s)]
*  We, the House, just censured a member for repeating it, and let me say it is absolutely [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6088.06s)]
*  despicable, but should that be banned or punished, the mere repetition of that phrase? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6095.9800000000005s)]
*  So thank you, Congressman. [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6105.18s)]
*  I'll just begin by saying again that most hate speech is protected speech under our [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6106.38s)]
*  Constitution, but context matters. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6110.46s)]
*  Are we talking about public institutions or non-public institutions? [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6112.38s)]
*  Are we talking about public fora or non-public fora? [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6116.54s)]
*  But I will also say again that where one finds hate speech, one often, almost invariably, [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6119.74s)]
*  finds hateful conduct. [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6125.82s)]
*  There's a very bright line between speech and conduct. [[01:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6128.06s)]
*  Of speech we tolerate because it can be combated by appealing to the better angels of our nature, [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6133.34s)]
*  by exposing the nature of evil that is behind it. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6139.74s)]
*  That's how we resolve our differences without resorting to force. [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6143.099999999999s)]
*  Now, my point is this. [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6147.179999999999s)]
*  We have this chant that calls for the eradication of Israel, and we punish people for using [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6149.42s)]
*  it. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6156.38s)]
*  Well, I happen to believe in the eradication of Hamas. [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6156.86s)]
*  I'm not making a moral equivalency. [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6160.62s)]
*  There couldn't be a stronger contrast between good and evil than that, but the same freedom [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6163.5s)]
*  of speech that protects my right to advocate that position. [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6169.900000000001s)]
*  Is at stake here, is it not? [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6176.46s)]
*  So I also very strongly support free speech, even freedom of speech to say things that [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6178.46s)]
*  we hate. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6184.46s)]
*  I believe that the Trump executive order on combating anti-Semitism does something [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6185.02s)]
*  important, which is to say it indicates that in many other areas of the law, we can use [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6190.38s)]
*  speech not as something to punish or suppress, but as an indicator of the nature of conduct. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6196.78s)]
*  So that, for example, if you say certain things and then throw a rock through the window of [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6204.139999999999s)]
*  the Hillel building, your statement may be used to determine whether that conduct was [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6209.82s)]
*  intentional, whether you intended to hit the building or not, and whether it was motivated [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6214.86s)]
*  in a way that implicates either student conduct codes or other rules of behavior. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6219.82s)]
*  I believe it is important for rules, whether within universities or within the Federal [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6224.620000000001s)]
*  Department of Education, to use conduct in this way. [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6230.22s)]
*  That is to say speech must be protected, but it is sometimes a way of understanding conduct, [[01:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6234.46s)]
*  which often crosses the line. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6240.46s)]
*  Well, yes, but then you're talking about the conduct and the influence of speech on it, [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6241.820000000001s)]
*  but the issue is the conduct, not the speech. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6246.620000000001s)]
*  What measures... [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6249.820000000001s)]
*  Let me ask the students, what measures would you propose to protect your rights to free [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6251.099999999999s)]
*  speech on the campuses? [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6256.86s)]
*  Ultimately, I would just ask for less pushback from the university. [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6263.9s)]
*  I mean, as long as we can more equally represent all perspectives, I think it would be much [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6268.38s)]
*  easier, much more conducive to do so for other students. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6274.86s)]
*  There is a word for that. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6279.42s)]
*  It's called tolerance. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6280.38s)]
*  Correct, yes, and it would be much less of a step up to speak your mind when you know [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6282.139999999999s)]
*  that violence is not coming your way for doing so. [[01:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6288.94s)]
*  Now it is so polarized, I just wish we could step that back or increase speech, allow others [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6291.5s)]
*  to not face such consequence when doing so. [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6297.42s)]
*  That would promote it. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6301.98s)]
*  Ms. Jordan? [[01:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6302.78s)]
*  Yeah, so I support what Connor said, and I think really instilling within the campus [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6303.9800000000005s)]
*  community that we need to be more tolerant of others' beliefs, whether we agree with [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6310.7s)]
*  them or not. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6316.46s)]
*  Like my school does a free speech training, but people will just click through that just [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6316.9400000000005s)]
*  to get it over with. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6321.5s)]
*  They're not actually being taught to respect people just because they're bullies. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6322.38s)]
*  That's just what we're asking for, to be respected. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6327.82s)]
*  We aren't asking to be doxed. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6330.3s)]
*  We aren't asking to be violently assaulted or harassed or anything like that. [[01:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6331.5s)]
*  We are simply sharing our viewpoint, and we respectfully listen to other students' and [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6336.3s)]
*  faculty's viewpoints, but they won't do the same to us. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6341.740000000001s)]
*  Similar to Mr. Marcus' comments, conduct often follows words. [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6349.58s)]
*  We saw at Cornell after chance of free Palestine from the river to the sea, which called it [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6353.900000000001s)]
*  the genocide of the Jewish people and the eradication of the state of Israel, that soon [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6359.02s)]
*  following that, a student posted direct threats to murder Jews on campus. [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6364.78s)]
*  Those are very interrelated, and they cannot be separated. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6370.78s)]
*  So are you saying the conduct should be banned or the speech should be banned or both? [[01:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6372.86s)]
*  Speech advocating for violence should not be tolerated on a college campus. [[01:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6377.82s)]
*  Well, but what about the eradication of Hamas? [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6382.22s)]
*  The eradication of Hamas is the eradication of a recognized terror organization. [[01:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6384.38s)]
*  So it depends upon your viewpoint. [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6393.5s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6395.18s)]
*  When students who are protesting the Jewish people's right to exist, [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6398.86s)]
*  their fellow students' right to exist, leads directly to violence against those students. [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6403.9800000000005s)]
*  Who's going to decide though which viewpoint is legal and which one is illegal? [[01:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6408.7s)]
*  That's what concerns me. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6414.86s)]
*  In a free society, we put all those viewpoints out there and let the people make that judgment for themselves. [[01:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6417.179999999999s)]
*  In the context of a college campus, it is the school's, the school has a right, [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6422.3s)]
*  and the school is obligated to protect all of its students from violence, [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6427.42s)]
*  and students should all feel safe on their campus. [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6431.58s)]
*  I know that Cornell is implementing additional DE&I training that now addresses anti-Semitism [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6433.58s)]
*  that all students will be required to complete so that all students feel safe. [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6439.66s)]
*  And there should be similar DE&I training to prevent Islamophobia on campus as well. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6443.42s)]
*  When talking about college campuses, the main priority is ensuring that students feel safe [[01:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6449.98s)]
*  and that they can freely express their opinions without feeling harmed or that harm is coming their way. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6454.38s)]
*  Gentlemen's time has expired. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6460.86s)]
*  The chair will recognize the gentlelady from Texas. [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6462.780000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6465.34s)]
*  I want to make it very clear that our committee is not undertaking this hearing today [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6468.54s)]
*  because my Republican colleagues actually care about free speech on college campuses [[01:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6473.42s)]
*  or even care about anti-Semitism. [[01:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6478.700000000001s)]
*  These are the same Republican colleagues who've worked tirelessly to defund all efforts for [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6481.660000000001s)]
*  diversity and inclusion initiatives in the appropriations bills. [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6487.82s)]
*  These are the same folks who want to censor and remove books they disagree with [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6492.54s)]
*  from classrooms and school libraries. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6497.9s)]
*  And the same folks- [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6501.0199999999995s)]
*  The lady will suspend just for a second. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6501.82s)]
*  My point of order was the statement that her colleagues, her Republican colleagues, [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6503.66s)]
*  do not care about anti-Semitism on college campuses or freedom of speech. [[01:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6507.74s)]
*  I would request that those words be taken down because they're absolutely untrue. [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6513.259999999999s)]
*  That's a matter of opinion. [[01:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6517.82s)]
*  The gentlelady from Texas was stating her opinion, but we've talked about this before [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6548.78s)]
*  in the committee. [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6552.62s)]
*  I think all of us should be cognizant of attributing motives to our colleagues and or other [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6553.179999999999s)]
*  individuals in the government, whether that be the president, the vice president, [[01:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6559.66s)]
*  or former president. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6562.62s)]
*  We should all be cognizant of that. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6564.299999999999s)]
*  The gentlelady is recognized for remainder for five minutes. [[01:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6565.42s)]
*  And I'll correct that. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6568.7s)]
*  I'll say some of my Republican colleagues. [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6569.82s)]
*  However, again, these are the same folks who've worked to defund efforts for diversity and [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6573.9s)]
*  inclusion initiatives in the appropriations bills. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6580.299999999999s)]
*  Those are a matter of record. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6583.259999999999s)]
*  Those votes are available for anyone to view. [[01:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6585.5s)]
*  These are also some of the same folks who want to censor and remove books they disagree [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6588.78s)]
*  with from classrooms and school libraries. [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6593.58s)]
*  And the same folks who balk at the prospect of teaching accurate history lessons [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6596.86s)]
*  on slavery and its repercussions in the United States. [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6602.86s)]
*  All of that is on the record and factual and available for anyone to review. [[01:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6606.86s)]
*  What is going on here is that there is an effort to capitalize on an emotionally charged issue [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6613.42s)]
*  to sow further frustration and division. [[01:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6620.0599999999995s)]
*  I have frequently complained and expressed my concerns around the fact that there are [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6623.0199999999995s)]
*  egregious efforts to continue to divide our country. [[01:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6629.66s)]
*  And many of those efforts are coming from this committee. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6633.42s)]
*  In the last four weeks alone, we've seen horrific incidents in the United States [[01:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6637.0199999999995s)]
*  fueled by both anti-Semitism and Islamophobia alike. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6642.7s)]
*  In the community that I represent of El Paso, Texas, we know full well, [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6648.3s)]
*  my community knows full well, the power of speech, the power of hate, [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6653.42s)]
*  and how that drifts into conduct. [[01:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6659.26s)]
*  On August 3rd, 2019, a white supremacist drove over 10 miles, I'm sorry, 10 hours to my community. [[01:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6663.18s)]
*  And he published a screed online talking about the invasion of migrants and Hispanics and [[01:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6672.860000000001s)]
*  immigrants into the United States. [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6680.860000000001s)]
*  Many of us flagged that speech as dangerous and as life threatening, and yet members of this [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6683.9800000000005s)]
*  committee continue to use that same speech, knowing full well the kind of danger it creates [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6691.42s)]
*  for my community and other communities like mine. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6698.9400000000005s)]
*  I want nothing more than for students to feel safe on their college campuses. [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6703.34s)]
*  I want all of us to feel safe and be able to express our opinions and to be able to address [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6709.58s)]
*  controversy head on without fearing for our lives or the lives of people who live with us, [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6717.66s)]
*  among us, near us. [[01:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6725.0199999999995s)]
*  These conversations are critical and important, and I want to thank our panelists for participating [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6728.7s)]
*  in these conversations. [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6735.5s)]
*  And it is really important that all of you put pressure on all of us to ensure that everyone [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6737.18s)]
*  can live in peace and dignity, free from the fear of violence, especially young people on [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6745.900000000001s)]
*  college campuses. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6754.14s)]
*  Professor Nadelle, Ms. Burdette, can you give us concrete strategies and policies that colleges [[01:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6756.46s)]
*  can use in order to create those safer spaces for young people? [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6763.9s)]
*  Sure, thank you very much for your question. [[01:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6772.379999999999s)]
*  And indeed, you know, there's a lot of serious work to do on this issue, and there are actions [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6775.9s)]

*  of what you're saying. [[01:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6790.139999999999s)]
*  So campuses have rules, and the way we use our rules tells the story of our values. [[01:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6791.82s)]
*  And that's why I mentioned campuses are, they've had someone arrested. [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6800.299999999999s)]
*  They have suspended people. [[01:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6805.82s)]
*  There's a, there are privacy concerns around speaking openly about disciplinary action [[01:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6807.259999999999s)]
*  against a student, especially in such a charged time. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6811.82s)]
*  But you get a protest permit, there's an approval process, there are rules you have [[01:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6815.74s)]
*  to follow in that protest, and not all speech is permissible in our country and on a campus. [[01:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6820.94s)]
*  And I think we heard one of the committee members say before that it's just up to people [[01:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6829.5s)]
*  to decide, and that's just not okay, because of course I'm here to testify on behalf of [[01:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6834.46s)]
*  free speech. [[01:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6841.66s)]
*  I'm invited by the Democrats. [[01:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6842.62s)]
*  I don't know why someone tried to divide this witness panel into two sides. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6844.139999999999s)]
*  I haven't heard two sides. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6848.62s)]
*  I've heard people of conscience, my fellow panelists. [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6850.54s)]
*  But when you call immigrants vermin invading our country, hate crimes against people who [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6854.299999999999s)]
*  look like an immigrant go up. [[01:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6861.259999999999s)]
*  I'm a practitioner. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6862.94s)]
*  That's my indicator. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6864.139999999999s)]
*  When Israel is in the front page and people are fighting about Israel, and you assault [[01:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6866.379999999999s)]
*  a Jew because of their connection to Israel, that's bigotry, that's a hate crime. [[01:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6871.66s)]
*  And words do have consequences. [[01:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6877.18s)]
*  And of course we can walk and chew gum at the same time. [[01:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6880.54s)]
*  I like the Austin Powers movie also, but we are civil society and elected leaders. [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6884.22s)]
*  And we can distinguish the difference between free expression that people don't like, [[01:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6891.58s)]
*  including conservative views that should be aired on campuses. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6898.14s)]
*  Ms. Jordan should never have been called a Nazi. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6902.54s)]
*  I was tearing up while she was talking about it. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6905.1s)]
*  But words have consequences. [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6908.3s)]
*  And we can't just have Lord of the Flies in our free speech marketplace. [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6910.3s)]
*  Thank you for that question. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6915.02s)]
*  Gentlelady yields back. [[01:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6917.26s)]
*  The chairman recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hunt. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6918.06s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, college and free speech go hand in hand. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6920.38s)]
*  And college is meant to be a place where students are safe to express ideas and confront ideas [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6925.42s)]
*  that they may or may not necessarily agree with. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6931.660000000001s)]
*  We've heard for years about microaggressions and how silence is violence. [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6935.1s)]
*  And colleges have spent years condemning and monitoring speech as they deem dangerous. [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6940.620000000001s)]
*  But when actual physical threats of violence occur, do colleges know how to react? [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6946.54s)]
*  Under the logic of the left, microaggressions are hate speech. [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6952.860000000001s)]
*  But physical threats of violence can be free speech depending on if the group being threatened [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6955.9800000000005s)]
*  is not oppressed enough. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6962.54s)]
*  It appears that colleges have labeled everything hate speech but hate speech itself. [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6965.26s)]
*  They claim to be committed to diversity, equity, and inclusion. [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6970.54s)]
*  But the dirty little secret is that there is a hierarchy of oppression within a DEI club. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6974.14s)]
*  And colleges fail to act when they consider these less oppressed groups to be threatened. [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6981.58s)]
*  Tragically, universities have put their responses to free speech under the DEI lens. [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6988.06s)]
*  And oftentimes, that lens fails to respond to threats for fear of angering the DEI gods. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=6993.66s)]

*  College campuses are supposed to be places where people can discuss ideas, including [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7330.62s)]
*  foreign policy, with civility and with the goal of understanding different perspectives [[02:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7336.3s)]
*  and learning from their peers. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7342.22s)]

*  but rather to address this problem writ large. [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7363.82s)]
*  It is the duty of the Department of Education's Office of Civil Rights, an office that my [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7367.9s)]

*  Civil Rights has the tools it needs to properly address anti-Semitism and all discrimination [[02:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7386.54s)]
*  on college campuses. [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7393.98s)]
*  My first question is for Professor Nadal and Ms. Burdett. [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7396.139999999999s)]
*  Could you just, let's go back to the basics. [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7402.0599999999995s)]
*  Why is it important that students at universities have freedom to espouse and explore a wide [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7405.0199999999995s)]
*  range of ideas? [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7412.54s)]
*  It's critical that the university continues to uphold the value of free speech because [[02:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7414.62s)]
*  what happens on the university campuses is that these are the places where our students [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7423.26s)]
*  learn to be future leaders. [[02:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7429.34s)]
*  How are they going to learn to be future leaders if they don't, if they're not exposed to [[02:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7431.099999999999s)]
*  opposite ideas and different points of view? [[02:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7436.3s)]
*  I think one of the most powerful statements comes from the, came from the Dean of Students [[02:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7439.26s)]
*  at the University of Chicago when he wrote to the entering class of 2020 and he told [[02:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7444.46s)]
*  them that yes, you have to be on campus, campus is certainly a place where you cannot be challenged, [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7451.1s)]
*  you cannot be threatened, but there are not going to be trigger warnings in the classrooms [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7457.58s)]
*  that you cannot shut down a speaker. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7463.1s)]
*  Speakers have to be able to come and hear the points of view and I've heard what the [[02:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7465.98s)]
*  students have said about their campuses, but at the University of Chicago they have upheld [[02:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7470.139999999999s)]
*  the value of hearing these diverse points of view so that when their graduates go out [[02:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7476.139999999999s)]
*  into the world they can become leaders and they know what people will be saying on multiple [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7481.339999999999s)]
*  sides of issues. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7486.7s)]
*  So we have to maintain that value. [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7487.5s)]
*  Ms. Burdett, do you have anything to add to that? [[02:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7490.62s)]
*  Of course, I mean universities have harder jobs than any of us in this room because they [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7492.78s)]
*  have to teach people how to think, not tell them what to think and we haven't really mastered [[02:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7498.78s)]
*  that. [[02:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7504.139999999999s)]
*  They are chartered, their mission is to create a platform that students, including some of the [[02:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7505.179999999999s)]
*  young people in this hearing room and Jewish students, can fill with their ideas and their [[02:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7513.74s)]
*  perspectives and their voices and that's how we learn. [[02:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7520.38s)]
*  And I don't think for one minute there's a university that doesn't know what's right and [[02:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7524.78s)]
*  wrong when it comes to is Hamas, was Hamas justified in that massacre, but they have a [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7531.42s)]
*  very hard job and they agreed in 1967 the University of Chicago issued the Kelvin Principles, [[02:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7539.02s)]
*  which is still a very influential document and they protected the right of young people to say, [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7547.58s)]
*  I don't want to die in Vietnam, I'm scared and it wasn't always the predominant view. [[02:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7554.54s)]
*  And so their jobs are hard. [[02:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7560.38s)]
*  We sit around and tell people what to think all the time. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7562.62s)]
*  It's really harder to teach them how to come to their own conclusions and I just have utmost [[02:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7565.42s)]
*  respect for the challenge they're facing. [[02:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7571.1s)]
*  We should be helping them do better, not walking away and pulling our marbles and our funding and [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7573.42s)]
*  our kids away. [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7579.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7580.78s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[02:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7581.26s)]
*  I yield back. [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7582.54s)]
*  Gentlewoman yields and I will take five minutes for questioning now. [[02:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7583.5s)]
*  First of all, I will deign to respond in regards to the gentleman from California in regards to [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7587.82s)]
*  anti-Semitic tropes, in particular in regards to one gentleman named Tom Steyer. [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7594.06s)]
*  That had nothing to do with anti-Semitism. [[02:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7599.66s)]
*  He was a presidential candidate. [[02:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7602.14s)]
*  He was taking his enormous wealth and putting it into a presidential campaign. [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7603.740000000001s)]
*  In America, it is fair game to be able to criticize someone when they've chosen to enter [[02:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7610.22s)]
*  the field of politics. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7618.38s)]
*  The gentleman, Mr. Steyer, threw in huge dollars. [[02:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7621.18s)]
*  He was described by the gentleman from California as a philanthropist. [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7624.22s)]
*  He was a presidential candidate who has thrown in hundreds of millions of dollars to political [[02:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7628.780000000001s)]
*  campaigns here in America. [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7633.740000000001s)]
*  That is fair game, using the cudgel of racism to stop free speech is also wrong. [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7635.5s)]
*  Mr. Marcus, if you could do it real briefly, so many of us, I have three children, much the same [[02:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7643.34s)]
*  age as them. [[02:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7650.46s)]
*  Where's this intolerance coming from? [[02:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7651.660000000001s)]
*  Where's this intolerance that really is a bit foreign for someone who went to college, [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7654.38s)]
*  you know, a few decades ago? [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7659.34s)]
*  Not just the anti-Semitism. [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7664.14s)]
*  Where's the intolerance coming from? [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7665.34s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, this has been a long time coming and the intolerance towards other groups is [[02:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7668.78s)]
*  not unrelated to the intolerance towards Jews. [[02:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7673.26s)]
*  We have for too long seen political polarization throughout our country with extreme [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7676.38s)]
*  aspects on the college campus. [[02:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7682.06s)]
*  There are extremists on the left, there are extremists on the right, but on the college [[02:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7684.38s)]
*  campus, the extremists on the left have considerably more influence, louder voices and [[02:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7688.14s)]
*  the greater ability to make their views heard. [[02:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7694.9400000000005s)]
*  Oftentimes, that means not just presenting their own opinions, but trying to silence [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7699.66s)]
*  others. [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7704.86s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7706.14s)]
*  So I turn to Ms. Jordan. [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7706.9400000000005s)]
*  Why do administrators fear the left? [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7710.46s)]
*  I would say that they fear the left because they don't want to hurt their feelings. [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7715.34s)]
*  I know that they probably are trying their best to, you know, be equal, be fair, but it [[02:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7719.9800000000005s)]
*  honestly feels like they are favoring those students. [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7725.34s)]
*  I know there are a lot of different departments within a Big Ten university and so some of [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7727.82s)]
*  those, we have a lot of diversity, equity, and inclusion spaces. [[02:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7732.46s)]
*  So a lot of those that are, you know, directly funded, directly associated with the [[02:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7735.26s)]
*  university, those are especially the leaders in initiating the activities that I feel like, [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7739.9s)]
*  you know, cuddle left-leaning students and empower them to, you know, attack us. [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7746.62s)]
*  Because Mr. Ogre-Zach, isn't it true that they don't fear you on the right on campus, [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7751.58s)]
*  that you're going to tear things down, that you're going to go out and do a nasty [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7758.0599999999995s)]
*  demonstration to deny somebody from coming into the campus who comes from the left point [[02:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7763.1s)]
*  of view to speak? [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7767.58s)]
*  I mean, I'm assuming the administrators don't fear you guys. [[02:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7768.78s)]
*  I would certainly hope that they would never expect us to commit any acts of violence against [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7773.42s)]
*  opposing speakers. [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7778.219999999999s)]
*  So we heard earlier in testimony, the quote was used and one of the panelists, we have [[02:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7780.0599999999995s)]
*  failed them. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7787.099999999999s)]
*  By the time it gets to the Office of Civil Rights, we have failed them. [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7787.66s)]
*  So Mr. Marcus, why would we put more federal dollars into something like this? [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7793.66s)]
*  I think this is part of what you're hearing from some of us up here, is we are saying, [[02:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7798.54s)]
*  is there really a federal role? [[02:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7804.62s)]
*  Should we be pumping more federal dollars in? [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7807.179999999999s)]
*  In fact, as we put more federal dollars in and we hear about more intolerance, less [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7809.9s)]
*  tolerance for free speech, are we going in the wrong direction by saying, federal government, [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7815.58s)]
*  you should try to do more? [[02:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7820.7s)]
*  Because maybe the federal government is being counterproductive. [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7821.98s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, my experience with the Office for Civil Rights is that it has had lean years [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7828.3s)]
*  and it has had fat years. [[02:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7833.9s)]
*  In either case, the head of that agency has been able to do what the head feels needs [[02:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7838.38s)]
*  to be done. [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7845.66s)]
*  That is to say, there may be in a particular year, 15 or 17 or 19,000 cases, but the number [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7846.219999999999s)]
*  of anti-Semitism cases will never be 1%. [[02:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7854.3s)]
*  And will seldom be 1 tenth of a percent. [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7857.74s)]
*  So it is my sense that while there may be political reasons and a host of policy reasons [[02:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7860.7s)]
*  to support either increases or decreases of the budget for that agency, and the Brandeis [[02:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7867.26s)]
*  Center is a nonpartisan group, we don't support others, that the Office for Civil Rights can [[02:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7872.94s)]
*  focus the resources it needs on fighting the problems that needed to be fought as long [[02:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7879.98s)]
*  as it has the political will and regardless of the budget in a particular year. [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7885.98s)]
*  I want to get one more question in here for Ms. Silberstein. [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7890.139999999999s)]
*  By the way, you are engaged with one of the most incisive questioners we have up here [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7893.179999999999s)]
*  in Mr. McClintock. [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7898.78s)]
*  It is a terrific lesson many of us have learned. [[02:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7899.98s)]
*  And why not tell parents, just take your dollars elsewhere? [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7903.099999999999s)]
*  If Cornell is going to act the way they do, if, I mean, Madison, University of Madison [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7907.5s)]
*  refuses to condemn pro-Hamas demonstrators chanting glory to the murders, why not just [[02:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7912.78s)]
*  tell parents to take your dollars elsewhere? [[02:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7917.98s)]
*  I mean, of course private individuals are entitled to do what they wish with their money. [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7923.9s)]
*  With regard to sending students to these schools, I've been faced with that question numerous [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7929.66s)]
*  times and I've had to grapple with it myself about why I would put myself in such a situation [[02:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7934.0599999999995s)]
*  that could potentially lead to my own harm. [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7939.74s)]
*  And I have gone to a Jewish day school my entire life and coming to Cornell, I was hoping to [[02:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7942.22s)]
*  encounter a variety of diverse perspectives from whom I'd be able to learn. [[02:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7948.14s)]
*  And upon coming here, I've realized that, you know, I've been hit with a lot of hatred [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7953.26s)]
*  and virulent anti-Semitism. [[02:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7958.78s)]
*  And it's something that makes me feel the need and the right to be there more, to combat it [[02:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7961.42s)]
*  and to continue to fight against it and to not let it win. [[02:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7969.1s)]
*  I want to thank all the witnesses for being here today. [[02:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7972.860000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[02:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7975.42s)]
*  May I have a minute to clarify my words that were used? [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7976.3s)]
*  Is that possible within the rules? [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7979.26s)]
*  Sure. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7982.54s)]
*  The chair will give you a let's take a minute. [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7982.780000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7985.42s)]
*  Thank you. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7986.06s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7986.54s)]
*  So I'm the one who said we failed them. [[02:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7988.3s)]
*  And fighting hate and preventing hate is a whole of society job. [[02:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7991.58s)]
*  We all have a job to do. [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=7998.22s)]
*  And if all we do is investigate a crime after someone's dead because of their identity, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8000.3s)]
*  I'm just saying we can interrupt it earlier. [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8007.5s)]
*  I hope we won't throw up our hands about what the United States of America and its government [[02:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8010.22s)]
*  can do to help encourage our society to be more tolerant and moral. [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8016.3s)]
*  So let's please not throw up our hands. [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8023.18s)]
*  Interventions work. [[02:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8025.42s)]
*  And when the FBI counts hate crimes, that is a deterrent. [[02:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8028.22s)]
*  When a school has a policy against hate, all they have to do is post it online. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8033.26s)]
*  There are less hate crimes. [[02:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8038.62s)]
*  So let's just make the FBI count hate crimes. [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8039.9800000000005s)]
*  It's optional right now. [[02:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8043.74s)]
*  Why? [[02:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8045.5s)]
*  So Miss Burdette, we can have more of a discussion on this offline. [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8046.38s)]
*  Thank you for your comments. [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8050.54s)]
*  Thank you for the time. [[02:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8051.66s)]
*  Um, I yield and would like to recognize the gentle lady from Georgia for five minutes [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8052.7s)]
*  of questioning. [[02:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8058.46s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chair. [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8059.66s)]
*  And as a woman, a woman of color who's lost her son to murder, the very kinds of bigotry [[02:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8060.7s)]
*  and discrimination and hatred that we're talking about today, I wake up every single morning. [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8069.42s)]
*  And when I see all of the elevated instances of anti-Semitism and bigotry and hatred, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8075.58s)]
*  and just racial division, I ask God every single day, are we losing our humanity? [[02:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8082.14s)]
*  And with that said, first, I'd like to thank the committee for holding this critical hearing [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8089.9s)]
*  to highlight the need to fund the Office of Civil Rights at the Department of Education [[02:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8095.9s)]
*  and the importance of diversity, equity, and inclusion offices across our schools. [[02:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8100.38s)]
*  As we address these incidents of hate speech across our college campuses. [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8107.98s)]
*  Yes, we have a right to speak our minds. [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8113.66s)]
*  We have a right to share our views and be ourselves. [[02:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8116.46s)]
*  But free speech is an invaluable right that is granted to us by the First Amendment. [[02:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8119.5s)]
*  And we must use it to nurture our diverse and ever changing country. [[02:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8125.42s)]
*  However, in a nation made up of many cultures and backgrounds, [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8131.58s)]
*  hate has no place, especially at our schools, where the minds of our young people are really [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8135.820000000001s)]
*  being nurtured. College campuses are places where people expand their knowledge, they gain new [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8145.580000000001s)]
*  perspectives, and pursue future success. And the recent occurrences on campuses where students [[02:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8151.900000000001s)]
*  have used the freedom of speech to harm and intimidate their classmates are despicable [[02:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8160.62s)]
*  and should prove our absolute need to incorporate diversity, equity, and inclusion education [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8167.26s)]
*  throughout all of our school systems. Not only would DEI offices and education [[02:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8175.34s)]
*  reducing the likelihood of these events happening in the future by bringing awareness and knowledge [[02:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8182.0599999999995s)]
*  to students who otherwise they may not learn about the richness of other cultures [[02:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8187.74s)]
*  until well into their adulthood. But it will also educate and support the diverse [[02:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8195.02s)]
*  interests of our children. And I truly believe this at heart because I'm a mother to my core. [[02:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8201.1s)]
*  And I mean this with every fiber of my being, we are losing our way. [[02:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8209.02s)]
*  In addition to DEI offices, we need to fund the Office of Civil Rights to equip students and [[02:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8213.42s)]
*  faculty experiencing intimidation, threats of violence, and other harmful acts with the tools [[02:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8218.54s)]
*  necessary to protect them. Without these support resources, students will continue to live in fear [[02:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8224.060000000001s)]
*  of harm while they know that they have little or no support in the event that they experience such [[02:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8231.74s)]
*  personal and hate-filled instances. Thank you, Mr. Chair, for having this hearing today. [[02:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8238.3s)]
*  Let's work to protect our students and affirm the value of all cultures by funding the Office of [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8245.58s)]
*  Civil Rights at the Department of Education and supporting diversity, equity, and inclusion [[02:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8252.3s)]
*  programs on campuses all across our country. Ms. Burdette and Dr. Nadelle, throughout your [[02:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8259.58s)]
*  professional careers, have either of you found that individuals with a better understanding [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8268.78s)]
*  and background of cultures dissimilar to theirs tend to be more understanding and accepting when [[02:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8274.14s)]
*  speaking to or about someone who's from a different culture? You know, one of my favorite things about [[02:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8281.02s)]
*  the president's strategy against anti-Semitism is that it talks about the need to celebrate [[02:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8288.14s)]
*  Jewish heritage. And of course understanding matters. And that is where communities can [[02:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8293.099999999999s)]
*  actually stop problems before they happen with understanding. And you know, you mentioned DEI. [[02:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8305.58s)]
*  There are people out there who want to tell Jewish people that DEI, those three letters, [[02:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8312.3s)]
*  are our enemy because it doesn't care about Jews. I work with DEI professionals all the time. And [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8317.18s)]
*  sometimes they weren't addressing anti-Semitism in the past. And it's a process to explain it, [[02:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8324.06s)]
*  to integrate Jews into DEI work. But everything I hear these last four weeks tells me Jews want [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8331.18s)]
*  to be welcome and included. And that's what the I stands for. Thank you. Thank you. Dr. Nadelle. [[02:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8338.62s)]
*  What I would add to that is that it is imperative to understand and learn about the diversity of [[02:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8347.42s)]
*  cultures in American life. And so to respond to one of the things Ms. Burdett said, we have had [[02:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8353.58s)]
*  proclaimed in the United States May as Jewish American Heritage Month at least since one of [[02:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8360.14s)]
*  the Bush administrations. I forget which one, maybe at least since 2004. And that this is a way in [[02:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8366.460000000001s)]
*  which Americans can learn a great deal about Jewish Americans. But we also have an array of [[02:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8372.7s)]
*  specific months dedicated to learning about the different cultures of the United States. And so [[02:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8379.42s)]
*  we need to support those efforts. Thank you. And I yield back. General Lee yields back. I should [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8384.460000000001s)]
*  have mentioned this earlier. You've been here now a couple hours, almost three hours. If anyone needs [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8389.980000000001s)]
*  a break, just let us know. If you need to step to the restroom or anything like, just let us know. [[02:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8395.740000000002s)]
*  We probably have about 45 more minutes of questioning. We'd like to keep going because [[02:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8399.82s)]
*  we are going to have to go to the floor for votes. So if it's okay with you, we'll continue to go. [[02:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8403.18s)]
*  The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Roy. Thank the witnesses. Thank you for being [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8407.18s)]
*  here. A couple of questions, particularly for the students. And appreciate you all being here. [[02:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8413.98s)]
*  Have any of the three of you ever in any meaningful way received support from the [[02:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8421.02s)]
*  Department of Education to perpetuate your viewpoints on campus to the best of your understanding? [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8426.7s)]
*  I have not received any supporting sentiments from them, no. Ms. Jordan? [[02:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8436.54s)]
*  I have not received sentiments either. I as well have not received any. [[02:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8440.62s)]
*  Yeah, I hear a lot from my colleagues on the other side of the aisle about how important it is to [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8446.220000000001s)]
*  have these offices of diversity, equity, inclusion. And I'm just wondering if any of the three of you [[02:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8449.5s)]
*  we have, you know, we dance around these topics all the time in this thing, but we have a white [[02:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8457.18s)]
*  male, we have a black female, we have a Jewish female. Have any of you felt, you know, exalted [[02:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8463.34s)]
*  or supported or helped by these offices of diversity, equity, and inclusion so that you [[02:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8469.18s)]
*  feel comfortable on campuses? Never. Actually, so the story I was telling earlier about how I [[02:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8474.86s)]
*  was doxxed in a group chat over 800 students, those were all black students. It was a group [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8481.900000000001s)]
*  chat for black people on campus. And at the time of my involvement as Secretary of Young [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8486.38s)]
*  Americans for Freedom, I served as the first year representative on the Black Student Union, [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8491.66s)]
*  which is an organization within the Afro House, which is a part of the DEI organization department [[02:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8495.9s)]
*  within our school. And they requested my removal. They had a meeting for that. And they said, [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8503.58s)]
*  if I did want to continue being on the board, I'd have to have a discussion with the executive [[02:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8509.42s)]
*  board and their director on how black students can have different viewpoints. I decided to [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8514.06s)]
*  discontinue my position because I felt like that's unnecessary. You shouldn't have to have [[02:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8521.26s)]
*  discussion on how people can have different viewpoints because that's common knowledge. [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8524.779999999999s)]
*  Ms. Silverstein, anything to add? Yes, I would just like to point out that [[02:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8529.42s)]
*  I've only been at Cornell for about a year and a half now. And this problem far exceeds my time [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8534.06s)]
*  at Cornell. It has been a persistent problem on college campuses for many, many years. My brother [[02:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8540.3s)]
*  attended the university about five years ago, and swastikas were posted outside of his dorm. [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8546.539999999999s)]
*  Following the Tree of Life synagogue shooting a few years ago, three swastikas were found within [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8552.22s)]
*  nine days on campus. And then we're seeing this happening now. The university, do you [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8559.099999999999s)]
*  know anything about that? The university issued what was, in my opinion, a weak response. [[02:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8563.34s)]
*  And clearly it is evident that it was weak as it has persisted on campus. And nothing is being done [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8569.58s)]
*  to stop these hateful symbols from being spread around campus. Ms. Silverstein, a quick question [[02:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8575.5s)]
*  for you and a question for the three of you. So I have this concern right now that I believe that [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8580.7s)]
*  we've got a world in which students fear disagreeing with professors, but don't feel [[02:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8586.14s)]
*  afraid for calling for the eradication of Jews, for example. Now there might be some free speech [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8591.1s)]
*  lanes that are wide enough to have some very hateful statements made. And I certainly support [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8598.86s)]
*  a very wide lane of tolerance with respect to free speech in the First Amendment. But the point here [[02:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8605.26s)]
*  is something a little bit different. Because all of us who have gone to law school and have studied [[02:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8610.94s)]
*  the whole idea of yelling fire in a crowded theater, right? We all get that there are some [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8615.1s)]
*  limits to speech. I fully associate myself with remarks of the gentleman from California, Mr. [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8622.62s)]
*  McClintock, in our need to defend free speech. But I feel like there's something that we are not [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8627.42s)]
*  talking about here that's actually the center of all this while we just go around the bar and [[02:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8633.26s)]
*  saying the same stuff over and over again. And that is that in a world in the 21st century with [[02:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8636.7s)]
*  TikTok and with a whole lot of say political actors and technological actors at play, [[02:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8641.66s)]
*  driving rhetoric and speech and driving what people see as news and information, [[02:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8648.94s)]
*  that we've got elements that are arising to something akin to yelling fire in a crowded [[02:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8655.66s)]
*  theater. I'm looking at TikTok data over the last week and I'm seeing a massive ramp up of the [[02:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8661.42s)]
*  stand with Palestine versus the stand with Israel. This is not accidental. That's not just something [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8667.02s)]
*  that just materializes. My point is when there's purposeful action designed directly to foment [[02:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8673.26s)]
*  actual response and hate and targeting of individuals, you have now stepped into the very [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8680.220000000001s)]
*  action that the gentleman from California, Mr. McClintock, was talking about. So my question for [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8685.5s)]
*  you as students, to the extent that you think that these devices are harmful or helpful for society [[02:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8690.140000000001s)]
*  generally, and I've got my views on that, with respect to TikTok and the use of technology, [[02:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8696.06s)]
*  can you expand on each of the three of you? The extent to which this TikTok and others have been [[02:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8700.779999999999s)]
*  used to dox you, target you, undermine you, and undermine your ability to engage in free speech [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8706.779999999999s)]
*  and free thinking as conservative or as free thinking Americans? I'll start with you Ms. [[02:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8712.3s)]
*  Silberstein and go down the line. So from my experience over the past few weeks, the rise [[02:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8717.34s)]
*  in anti-Semitism that we've seen, yes it has been around in person, at rallies, at protests, [[02:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8724.38s)]
*  on campuses, but a large part of the issue stems from many of the comments made on social media. [[02:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8730.779999999999s)]
*  People think that they can hide behind some perceived veil of anonymity and post whatever [[02:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8737.9s)]
*  comments, however hurtful, however targeted, however menacing they may be. People think that [[02:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8743.42s)]
*  they can post them about Jews with impunity and not receive any ramifications for their actions. [[02:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8748.78s)]
*  So I think that social media in general has been fueling the fire and as we've seen with the [[02:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8756.220000000001s)]
*  Cornell student who was recently arrested, that veil of anonymity was pierced and your words have [[02:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8763.820000000002s)]
*  consequences and I think that all students should really take that to heart, that what you write [[02:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8770.78s)]
*  online can be traced back to you and people take it to heart. Ms. Jordan? Yeah I feel like technology [[02:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8775.5s)]
*  usage is a double-edged sword because on one aspect you can connect with people, especially [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8783.42s)]
*  like-minded people, but that can also be dangerous because it can create a mob mentality [[02:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8788.62s)]
*  like the experience I've discussed repeatedly and also I feel like there with social media channels [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8793.98s)]
*  especially TikTok, they can just create targeted things. Once you like something then it shows you [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8801.1s)]
*  similar content so like if someone just happens to like a pro-Palestine graphic then they're [[02:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8807.66s)]
*  absorbed more and more and then you know once people start sharing stuff on their stories that's [[02:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8815.26s)]
*  a huge thing. You know like if you're the only one who shares an Israel one then people start like [[02:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8819.98s)]
*  DMing you and attacking you and it's like a lot of fear because it's like are you scared to lose [[02:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8825.66s)]
*  friends and followers? Do you want to stand up for what you believe in? Then that kind of translates [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8831.5s)]
*  to like you know being physically involved in groups and organizations on campus. There's [[02:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8836.14s)]
*  like so much fear kind of what you share online like you know should you have the which side [[02:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8842.7s)]
*  flag should you have in your bio things like that are like hotly discussed and also I feel [[02:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8849.74s)]
*  like a lot of people use online to like kind of organize too which in one aspect you can you know [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8855.42s)]
*  kind of see what they're up to and what they plan to do to your event because that's where we find [[02:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8861.98s)]
*  that a lot of people want to protest our conservative events but also you know makes them [[02:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8866.62s)]
*  gauge a larger community honestly of hate and it's just I don't know it's a very hard thing to kind [[02:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8872.62s)]
*  of have discretion over kind of knowing you know what's right what should be allowed what shouldn't [[02:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8881.18s)]
*  be and kind of in general it's very very divisive. Thank you very quickly Mr. Grudziak we're way over [[02:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8886.86s)]
*  time but if you would answer really quickly. Mr. Chairman isn't time yeah. [[02:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8893.580000000002s)]
*  I would certainly like to echo many of Miss Jordan's sentiments about [[02:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8897.98s)]
*  social media opening up the door to conflicting thoughts and of course there's no debate that it [[02:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8906.539999999999s)]
*  certainly does open up to more speech however yes it is very unfortunate that it is a common tool [[02:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8910.699999999999s)]
*  of doxxing. I've been victim of this my friends fellow EF members have I'm not a user of TikTok [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8915.5s)]
*  but across both Instagram and Snapchat no shortage of leaking addresses untrue slurs about myself and [[02:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8922.46s)]
*  others and it is extremely unfortunate that this is the case I know we were well over time here [[02:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8930.699999999999s)]

*  because I think that is a real problem in our country. Anti-Semitism is not confined to our [[02:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8984.7s)]
*  nation's universities according to a January 2023 report entitled anti-Semitic attitudes in America [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8990.3s)]
*  the Anti-Defamation League concluded that 85 percent of Americans believe at least one anti-Jewish [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=8997.02s)]
*  trope as opposed to 61 percent in 2019. A more recent ADL report shows a 388 percent rise [[02:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9003.5s)]

*  that you were opposed to Congress legislating any definition of anti-Semitism in 2017 [[02:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9055.18s)]
*  and you remain opposed today respecting your stance can you briefly explain whether Trump's [[02:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9059.9s)]

*  and there have been other similar statements that I have thought were anti-Semitic because [[02:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9084.699999999999s)]
*  what that statement was doing was buying into one of these very classic anti-Semitic tropes [[02:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9089.42s)]
*  about the loyalty of the Jewish people and that the question that they cannot be loyal to the [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9095.74s)]
*  nation in which they live because they hold a higher loyalty to their own people but to say [[02:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9101.74s)]
*  that they were being disloyal to the United States because they voted for a different political party [[02:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9106.46s)]
*  is not saying that one is is disloyal to the United States it's just that they had a different view [[02:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9111.66s)]
*  in terms of the party they preferred. Unfortunately that wasn't the first time that Trump attacked [[02:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9118.539999999999s)]
*  American Jews nor was it the first time the 2024 Republican presidential front runner engaged with [[02:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9123.9s)]

*  is that those groups are not capable of orchestrating something like that by themselves [[02:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=9205.74s)]

*  quickly then i did have a question for mr marcus of course yeah i just wanted to touch on [[03:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11789.9s)]
*  representative roy's question regarding you know application of dei offices and why they may not [[03:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11793.58s)]
*  be so effective i mean of course my biggest problem with these offices is the i and dei [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11799.02s)]
*  inclusion of course i think it's a pretty safe assumption that everyone here wants the inclusion [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11804.22s)]
*  of all viewpoints however i i don't understand how such offices can pretend to facilitate that [[03:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11808.94s)]
*  when it's so unequally applied you know when we hosted alan west on our campus he came to [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11818.22s)]
*  spoke about to speak about race and this was heavily protested especially by members of this [[03:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11823.26s)]
*  office the university itself and their distinguished speaker series which is pretty well known in the [[03:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11828.38s)]
*  buffalo area was able to host nicole hannah jones who was the founder of the 1619 project [[03:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11833.34s)]
*  these speakers each came to talk about race they each have large followings but the response to [[03:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11839.019999999999s)]
*  them was vastly different you know if dei offices were committed to handling these topics equally i [[03:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11845.5s)]
*  fail to see why there was this discrepancy so one of the things i've just recently learned about [[03:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11852.3s)]
*  you made me think of it um you know i know on campuses we had these safe spaces we have free [[03:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11856.38s)]
*  speech and all this stuff that doesn't it seems to me the free speech zone should be everywhere [[03:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11861.02s)]
*  it's called the first amendment but we have these things but i learned about this issue called no [[03:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11864.14s)]
*  contact orders have any of the three of you students experience that dynamic on campus where [[03:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11868.54s)]
*  someone says they don't like your point of view they report to the dei office or someone in [[03:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11873.98s)]
*  in the campus in authority and then there's a there's an order that you're not allowed to have [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11878.38s)]
*  contact with another student because that student is somehow offended by what you believe or what [[03:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11882.619999999999s)]
*  you may have said have any of you had any experience with that um i personally have not had any [[03:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11886.38s)]
*  experience with that okay i also have personally not experienced that okay i have not either that's [[03:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11891.82s)]
*  good to hear maybe it's maybe it's not very prevalent which would be a good thing mr mark [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11897.34s)]
*  in your opening statement you talked about four things you thought should happen that you were [[03:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11901.1s)]
*  suggesting the committee do if you could just and i just i just wrote down one to four but i didn't [[03:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11905.26s)]
*  get all didn't get those if you could just recite those for me again that'd be great [[03:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11908.7s)]
*  certainly mr chairman i suggested that congress could provide the education department with [[03:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11912.220000000001s)]
*  tools to address violations of the freedom of speech similar to the way in which it handles [[03:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11917.9s)]
*  violations of the right to be free of discrimination okay second that there could be a special advisor [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11924.699999999999s)]
*  or coordinator for free speech within the department of education reporting to the secretary [[03:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11932.38s)]
*  third i promoting free speech promoting the first amendment not not the disinformation governance [[03:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11938.06s)]
*  board that the obama or the biden administration tried to set up that would limit speech is that [[03:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11943.42s)]
*  right that's right mr chairman got it um if free speech is addressed if at all by the office of [[03:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11947.42s)]
*  general counsel by the office for civil rights there are implications of work done by the office [[03:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11954.38s)]
*  of post-secondary education and other components but there is no institutional repository of [[03:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11958.3s)]
*  knowledge on how it is that free speech can be protected okay um a third i suggested that the [[03:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11963.98s)]
*  anti-semitism awareness act would provide important tools for the education department [[03:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11971.82s)]
*  and i believe the fourth one is that the there could be a check on whether the biden administration [[03:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11978.86s)]
*  is indeed planning to issue the promised regulations implementing the trump executive [[03:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11985.34s)]
*  order 13899 next month as promised in the oira unified agenda and regulatory plan but for which [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=11992.14s)]
*  there's been no talk in that's something that's that's you know current that we need to you know [[03:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12002.939999999999s)]
*  pressing right now i want to thank all of our witnesses particularly our students miss silverstein [[03:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12008.3s)]
*  especially you and what you've had to endure but thank you all for being here the chair not [[03:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12011.5s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to address in the context of this hearing my concerns about [[03:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12015.5s)]
*  diversity equity and inclusion offices on campuses in particular we've heard some of that today but [[03:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12025.900000000001s)]
*  I noticed a trend that's very disturbing to me and then I want to come to some of the students [[03:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12032.220000000001s)]
*  and ask you about your experiences on campus as well but it seems to me that staff at diversity [[03:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12035.900000000001s)]
*  inclusion departments on many college campuses today are noticeably anti-semitic and go about [[03:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12040.7s)]
*  their work in a manner contrary to the stated intent of treating all with equality or equity [[03:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12046.140000000001s)]
*  in 2021 heritage did a report on the anti-semitism of dei staff at universities that objectively [[03:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12052.300000000001s)]
*  validates my hypothesis on this matter in conducting its study heritage search the twitter [[03:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12059.42s)]
*  feeds of 741 dei personnel at 65 universities to find comments regarding israel and for comparison [[03:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12065.02s)]
*  also looked at their comments about china those dei staff tweeted retweeted or liked almost three [[03:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12072.54s)]
*  times as many tweets about israel as tweets about china but here's what's disturbing notably of the [[03:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12078.54s)]
*  tweets about israel 96 percent were critical of the jewish state while 62 percent of the tweets [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12084.300000000001s)]
*  about china were favorable towards china so consider that it appears to me through that data [[03:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12091.02s)]
*  that dei staff simply across our college campuses university are favoring china and disfavoring [[03:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12096.380000000001s)]
*  israel in my view this explains in large part the lack of response towards anti-semitic instances by [[03:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12103.74s)]
*  dei staff on college campuses seems clear to me that there are a number of higher education [[03:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12109.66s)]
*  institutions whose dei staff are disconnected with the values and the strategic objectives of [[03:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12115.26s)]
*  the us and what's more they are clearly anti-semitic one of the most painful videos from the fallout of [[03:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12120.62s)]
*  the hamas attack on israel on this issue in particular is from uc berkeley and in the video [[03:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12127.660000000002s)]
*  you can watch jewish students pleading with the vice chancellor of dei to do something to protect [[03:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12134.220000000001s)]

*  dei administrators to assist the students themselves put together a vigil for israel within 24 hours [[03:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12150.06s)]
*  despite their busy schedules and despite their workload and despite the fact that they're not [[03:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12156.539999999999s)]
*  getting paid to do that as part of their job simply put jewish students in many cases receive [[03:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12160.14s)]
*  disproportionate pushback and opposition by dei staff on college campuses it's atrocious to me [[03:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12166.3s)]
*  dr nadal earlier defined anti-semitism in a number of different ways but on campuses she said [[03:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12173.26s)]
*  quote it involves threats violence intimidation and discrimination on campuses that was part of [[03:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Y6blXNmFjE&t=12179.5s)]
