# Melissa Francis: Trump's 'Middle East doctrine' a game changer
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk)
*  Remember who Soleimani was. He was the man who set up all of the militias, which are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=0.0s)]
*  really like Iran's foreign ministry. They never wanted to have to take the blame or [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=5.72s)]
*  the credit for having gone to war in Iraq, in Syria, in Lebanon, and Yemen. They wanted [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=9.92s)]
*  to have plausible deniability, which I think is, by the way, one of the most significant [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=18.76s)]
*  things that happened yesterday was that the Ayatollah himself, he sent those missiles [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=22.8s)]
*  from Iranian territory and that it was very clear that he himself made the decision. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=29.92s)]
*  So Iran was owning this. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=36.04s)]
*  And was said to be present. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=37.04s)]
*  Present, and he owns this. In other words, I own this. This is my response for the killing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=38.04s)]
*  of Soleimani and the fact that it was such a minimal response and that no Americans died, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=44.28s)]
*  I think is just extraordinary. And if it's true what their foreign minister said yesterday, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=49.92s)]
*  we've done, we've done it, we've done our retaliation. If that's the case, Trump has [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  an opportunity that no president has had really for 50 years. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=59.56s)]
*  To offer an offer to Iran, that's what you're saying. That's what the opportunity is. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=64.56s)]
*  The offer to Iran, and for a couple of reasons, which you understand better than anybody, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=68.6s)]
*  because it's the oil. We are independent. The president said that we don't need their [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=72.88s)]
*  In fact, if Iran threatens to shut down the Persian Gulf or the Strait of Hormuz, they [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=77.24s)]
*  do themselves far more harm than us. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=81.8s)]
*  So to me, that was the biggest point, the salient feature of the president's speech. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=83.96s)]
*  And to me, it was his Middle East doctrine. And if you listen to it, he said, look, America's [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=89.24s)]
*  doing great. We are energy independent. This is something that we thought could never happen, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=93.91999999999999s)]
*  which is true. I myself was in the Middle East. I was in Saudi Arabia during our last [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=98.8s)]
*  huge spike. People were saying it was peak oil, that we were running out of oil. And [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=103.32s)]
*  we did believe that the Middle East had control over the world. Our economies, they do not [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=107.68s)]
*  now because of the Shell Revolution and all of the oil production in the U.S. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=113.36s)]
*  So he said, look, this is not our problem any longer. We don't have, we've been accused [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=117.8s)]
*  of being in the Middle East for oil for so long. We don't need that oil. I am calling [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=123.36s)]
*  on NATO to get involved and get here in the Middle East and find a peace solution. This [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=128.06s)]
*  is not for us. So that answers that question of people who were saying, are we getting [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=135.66s)]
*  into another war that's going to last forever? He said today, quite the opposite. I'm ending [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=139.98s)]
*  this conversation. Iran, you need to end your actions. I'm not going to let a nuclear weapon [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=145.44s)]
*  happen, but I'm also not going to be the police of the Middle East. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vbjtv0NL2pk&t=150.5s)]
