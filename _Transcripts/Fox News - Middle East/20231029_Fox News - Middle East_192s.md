# Brian Kilmeade: Is this the way a world super power acts?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA)
*  New tonight, Israel expanding ground operations big time and the escalation of the war, what [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=0.0s)]
*  we were expecting for quite a while against Hamas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=8.64s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in his first news conference since the October [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=11.88s)]
*  7th attack, says the conflict is entering the second stage, officials outlining this [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=16.76s)]
*  plan to destroy, dismantle and totally defeat Hamas. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=21.6s)]
*  It will not be easy. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=26.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, the IDF also launching more details and more strikes against Hezbollah targets [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=27.56s)]
*  in southern Lebanon in their northern border as fighting escalates between the two sides, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=32.6s)]
*  fueling new concerns of a wider, at least a two-front war. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=37.839999999999996s)]
*  Now, for the very latest on the ground, let's go out to the man on the ground right there, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=41.68s)]
*  Chief International Correspondent Steve Harrigan in northern Israel. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=46.04s)]
*  Hey, Steve. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  Ryan, Hezbollah is about two miles behind me and Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon have [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=52.52s)]
*  been launching a variety of attacks into northern Israel over the past 24 hours. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=57.760000000000005s)]
*  They have fired rockets, they've fired a guided missile, which Israel intercepted, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  and they've also fired mortars into Israel. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=67.36s)]
*  This has set off alarms in many communities around northern Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=69.52000000000001s)]
*  Israel has responded. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=73.68s)]
*  They have used drones to attack what they call terror cells. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  These are Hezbollah fighters firing anti-tank missiles into Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=78.48s)]
*  Israel using drones to destroy some of those cells. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=83.04s)]
*  This happens as protests continue in Lebanon. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=85.92s)]
*  A lot of people in Lebanon angry at the conditions for civilians in Gaza, and they want that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=89.04s)]
*  fighting to stop. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=93.68s)]
*  This has largely been for the past three weeks a pretty much contained war on Israel's northern [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=95.06s)]
*  border between Hezbollah on one side, Israeli fighters on the other side. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=99.68s)]
*  47 Hezbollah fighters killed, six Israeli soldiers killed, and all across the north [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=104.82s)]
*  here people are leaving their homes. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=110.17999999999999s)]
*  More than 40 communities here evacuated, people afraid about what might be coming ahead. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=112.13999999999999s)]
*  Ryan, back to you. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=117.53999999999999s)]
*  All right, Steve, thanks so much. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=118.94s)]
*  We'll stay on top of that and we'll check with you again this hour. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=121.85999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, the prime, meanwhile this, U.S. fighter jets unleashing airstrikes on Iran-backed [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  militias in Syria. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=129.01999999999998s)]
*  Now, this happened initially Thursday after a series of attacks on U.S. troops, which [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=131.3s)]
*  we actually refused to answer. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=134.86s)]
*  Look at that map that we're all seeing together. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=137.9s)]
*  That's where we hit. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=140.26000000000002s)]
*  But if we would put the blast map out there, you'd see 19 separate attacks since the October [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=141.38000000000002s)]
*  7th attack. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=146.58s)]
*  Now, think about this for a second. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=147.58s)]
*  19 attacks on our forces. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=149.62s)]
*  You got 2,500 in Iraq. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=151.74s)]
*  You got 900 in Syria. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=153.52s)]
*  You got smaller bases in and around that area. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=155.08s)]
*  They hit on us with Iranian-backed militias, which they freely admit to, and we hit them [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=157.98s)]
*  back one time and we hit a weapons depot. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=163.62s)]
*  I'm glad to do it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=165.78s)]
*  But in your mind, is that the way a superpower acts? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=167.57999999999998s)]
*  Is that the way we defend ourselves? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDHRpJStuWA&t=171.7s)]
