# Biden reportedly told Netanyahu 'take the win' after intercepting Iran attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E)
*  President Biden told Iran, don't. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=0.0s)]
*  And it did. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  But is Biden giving power now to the Islamic Republic [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=6.3s)]
*  and hanging Israel out to dry? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=9.74s)]
*  It's ironic that we find ourselves [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  in the all-too-familiar position of talking about a long list [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=14.84s)]
*  of deterrence failures by the Biden administration. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=18.98s)]
*  Mr. President, don't. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=21.92s)]
*  Stop it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=24.62s)]
*  Support Israel. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=26.1s)]
*  With respect, go to Amazon and buy a spine online. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=28.24s)]
*  We've gone from peace through strength [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=32.72s)]
*  to war through weakness. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=34.92s)]
*  It's no surprise that Biden is doing more to constrain Israel [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=37.16s)]
*  than he is to constrain Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=41.9s)]
*  President Biden told our closest Middle East ally [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=45.7s)]
*  that the U.S. would not take part in any counterstrike, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  or as the New York Post puts it, Iran your own. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=53.4s)]
*  Peter Ducey at the White House. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Peter. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=60.12s)]
*  And, Harris, the Biden-Iran policy [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=61.12s)]
*  is kind of hard to understand because on the one hand, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=63.68s)]
*  you've got officials saying that President Biden's support [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=65.96s)]
*  for Israel is unwavering. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=67.86s)]
*  But then you've got officials telling us [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=70.2s)]
*  that President Biden and the U.S. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=71.92s)]
*  will not support Israel [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=73.6s)]
*  if they launch a counterstrike against Iran. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=75.5s)]
*  It's hard to look at what President Biden has done [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=79.3s)]
*  with respect to Iran and say that he hasn't been tough on Iran [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=81.53999999999999s)]
*  and that we haven't put pressure on them, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=84.98s)]
*  that we haven't additional 500 sanctions, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  additional resources. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=90.39999999999999s)]
*  President Biden also told Netanyahu [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=92.5s)]
*  after missile defenses knocked down about 99% [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=94.24s)]
*  of Iran's incoming missiles to take the win. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  That is according to a report in Axios. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  But that is really lacking in terms of support for Israel [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=102.1s)]
*  in the eyes of Republican critics on Capitol Hill [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=105.97999999999999s)]
*  who want the president to do more than just consult G7 allies [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=108.34s)]
*  about strong diplomatic options. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=112.41999999999999s)]
*  The parade of horribles you just mentioned, Trey, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=116.12s)]
*  I want to stress it is happening [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  because Joe Biden has projected weakness [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  all around the world. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=122.18s)]
*  Russia did not invade Ukraine on Donald Trump's watch. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=123.56s)]
*  He did on Barack Obama and Joe Biden's watch. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=126.12s)]
*  Iran would have never thought to shoot 300 missiles [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  and drones at Israel when Donald Trump was president. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=131.70000000000002s)]
*  This is a White House that over the last couple of years [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=135.34s)]
*  has unfrozen billions of dollars of money [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=137.44s)]
*  that is now in the leaders of Iran's hands. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=140.88s)]
*  They insisted it couldn't be used to fund attacks [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=144.22s)]
*  or buy weapons, but these attacks have not stopped, Harris. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=146.16s)]
*  Well, and they don't pay for themselves. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  Peter Ducey, thank you very much. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=153.29999999999998s)]
*  Two headlines in the Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=155.44s)]
*  Biden wanted to avoid a regional war. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  Now he's got one. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=160.54s)]
*  U.S. deterrence fails again as Tehran shows [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=162.17999999999998s)]
*  it's willing to take risks while Biden tries to restrain Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=165.38s)]
*  In focus, Florida Republican Congressman Brian Maast, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=169.77999999999997s)]
*  member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=173.0s)]
*  and also the Subcommittee for the Middle East, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=175.04s)]
*  North Africa and International Terrorism [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=177.38s)]
*  and a decorated member of our armed forces. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=180.48s)]
*  He is retired. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=183.72s)]
*  You saw him saluting earlier. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=184.56s)]
*  I wanna lean on your acumen in terms of that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=186.57999999999998s)]
*  and talk to me about what it means to, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=190.01999999999998s)]
*  as the president told Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=192.6s)]
*  and the War Council, take the win. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=195.16s)]
*  And for the administration to say this, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=198.24s)]
*  you were able to knock some drones out of the sky, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=203.24s)]
*  maybe 300 Saheed, 136, carrying a payload of, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=205.64000000000001s)]
*  let's say roughly 100 pounds of ordnance, each one of them. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=209.04000000000002s)]
*  We helped you knock them out of the sky. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=212.28s)]
*  Let's just leave it at that and let's allow them to regroup [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=213.78s)]
*  and maybe do something more substantial. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=217.44s)]
*  Let's allow them to regroup and realize [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=219.48000000000002s)]
*  that as the administration said, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=221.68s)]
*  they're not going to have your back in retaliating. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=223.32000000000002s)]
*  Let's allow them to regroup [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=225.66000000000003s)]
*  and retaliating, let's allow them to regroup [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=227.26s)]
*  while you have 40 Democrats in the house. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=229.73999999999998s)]
*  One of them being Nancy Pelosi, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=232.06s)]
*  a pretty mainstream Democrat going out there and saying, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=233.73999999999998s)]
*  let's essentially embargo and sanction Israel [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=236.82s)]
*  in this literal time of war [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=240.38s)]
*  by not transferring any further arms to Israel, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=242.29999999999998s)]
*  which is what the letter they literally wrote last week said. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=245.62s)]
*  And this is the message that Democrats, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=249.22s)]
*  the Biden administration and House Democrats, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=251.89999999999998s)]
*  it's what they're all sending to Iran [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=253.79999999999998s)]
*  and to any foreign intelligence agencies out there [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=255.56s)]
*  that are paying attention to this conflict. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=257.8s)]
*  Look, with all the committees you sit on, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=259.04s)]
*  I feel like I can ask you this question. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=260.48s)]
*  We don't have a lot of details, I would imagine, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=263.44s)]
*  about what North Korea could put on a plane, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=265.68s)]
*  but it is not outside the bounds that Iran could put a warhead [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=268.32s)]
*  that has a nuclear tip on it and send it wherever it wanted to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=272.76s)]
*  with some help and maybe 48 hours notice. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=276.68s)]
*  What would that look like in terms of a game change? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=280.16s)]
*  And I don't want to telegraph something [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=282.72s)]
*  that hasn't happened yet, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=284.2s)]
*  but look, they didn't have to give a heads up [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=286.32s)]
*  what happens when they don't. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=288.24s)]
*  I'm slightly outside of your question [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=292.03999999999996s)]
*  and say something that's maybe more probable. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=293.32s)]
*  We know that Iran has fissile material. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=295.92s)]
*  We know that they have heavy water reactors [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=298.76s)]
*  that they've been working towards building nuclear weapons. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=301.09999999999997s)]
*  So maybe they can't quite create the Oppenheimer scenario yet, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=303.24s)]
*  but that doesn't mean that they can't create a dirty warhead, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=307.38s)]
*  a dirty payload. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=310.2s)]
*  Fissile material spread across Israel [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=311.36s)]
*  by the disbursement of 300 separate drones [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=313.56s)]
*  that are being fired in their direction, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=316.84s)]
*  making areas essentially unusable. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=318.68s)]
*  That's absolutely realistic. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=320.84s)]
*  It's been a realistic threat for a long time. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=323.04s)]
*  So I'm not going to speculate on whether North Korea [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=325.02s)]
*  might hand them something or whether Russia [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=327.96s)]
*  or somebody else. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=330.56s)]
*  Obviously, there's a great alliance [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=331.4s)]
*  between Iran and Russia there as well. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=332.68s)]
*  I won't speculate on that one, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=334.46s)]
*  but let's say certainly they have fissile material [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=335.54s)]
*  and that would be in the realm of possibility [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=337.72s)]
*  and probably even probability. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=339.6s)]
*  That's helpful information. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=341.68s)]
*  And the reason I would go to like a North Korea [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=342.92s)]
*  is because it's ready-made. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=345.15999999999997s)]
*  But from what you're saying, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=346.4s)]
*  it doesn't have to be ready-made [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=347.48s)]
*  and it certainly doesn't have to be perfect. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=349.04s)]
*  It could be a dirty situation using the materials [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=351.32s)]
*  that they have already on ground. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=354.56s)]
*  All right, back in 2020, [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=355.84s)]
*  then candidate Joe Biden called out [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=358.44s)]
*  then President Donald Trump for getting, quote, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=361.84s)]
*  dangerously close to starting a war with Iran. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=364.36s)]
*  If you haven't seen it recently, watch this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=367.04s)]
*  The president who says he wants to end endless wars [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=370.4s)]
*  in the Middle East is bringing us dangerously close [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=372.79999999999995s)]
*  to starting a brand new one. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  A president who says he wants out of the region [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=377.94s)]
*  sends an additional 18,000 plus troops [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  to do with the crisis of his own making. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=384.35999999999996s)]
*  An administration that claims its actions [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=386.96s)]
*  have made America safer in the same breath [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=388.88s)]
*  urges our citizens to leave Iraq, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=392.52s)]
*  puts Americans throughout the region on notice [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=395.0s)]
*  because of the increased danger that now exists. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=398.06s)]
*  It was almost like he was telling [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=401.98s)]
*  his own future about himself. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=403.42s)]
*  The Biden administration, that the accusations [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=408.18s)]
*  that they make are the crimes that they themselves [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=410.68s)]
*  are actually committing. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=413.18s)]
*  And this goes with their foreign policy as well. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=414.82s)]
*  We see, as many have spoken about, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=417.1s)]
*  you don't have a peace through strength policy [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=419.58s)]
*  with the Biden administration. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=421.94s)]
*  It's been characterized many ways [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=423.42s)]
*  and you don't have to decode what they're saying as well. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=425.1s)]
*  They're crystal clear with our allies, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=428.1s)]
*  with America's allies, we will not have your back [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=430.82s)]
*  in this situation. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=433.96000000000004s)]
*  That's what leads to the weakness. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=435.40000000000003s)]
*  And let's bring this back to one other place. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=436.98s)]
*  Former CENTCOM general, General McKenzie, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=439.22s)]
*  head of CENTCOM under Biden, he has been very clear [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=442.02000000000004s)]
*  now that he's out of uniform that the Biden administration [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=444.86s)]
*  literally took Iran off the table as a target. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=447.78000000000003s)]
*  He actually characterized it as giving aid and comfort [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=452.14000000000004s)]
*  to our enemy. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=455.46000000000004s)]
*  And if you take them off the target list, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=456.3s)]
*  then they are actually, there's no deterrence [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=458.70000000000005s)]
*  for them whatsoever. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=460.94s)]
*  Why would they do that? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=461.78000000000003s)]
*  And that's what he quantified as very probably. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=462.6s)]
*  Because the Biden administration has no sense [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=463.74s)]
*  of what peace through strength actually means. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=466.88s)]
*  And that's where, again, McKenzie said it very well himself. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=469.46000000000004s)]
*  That's giving aid and comfort to our enemy. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=472.38s)]
*  Congresswoman Mast, thank you for being in focus today. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOmX6GH665E&t=475.02000000000004s)]
