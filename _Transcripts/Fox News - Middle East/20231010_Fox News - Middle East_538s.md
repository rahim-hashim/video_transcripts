# Israel, Hamas trade fire as war escalates
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU)
*  And focus now from Tel Aviv, Danny Danone, former Israeli ambassador to the United Nations [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=0.0s)]
*  and member of Israel's House of Representatives. Ambassador, when you and I have spoken in earlier [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  times, it was always about the potential for this. What was the tipping point that you see [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=13.84s)]
*  that got Hamas in a position to be able to make this kind of strike on a sovereign nation next door? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  Harris, to be honest with you, we don't know. You cannot look for any logic when you deal [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=26.56s)]
*  with terrorists. There is no logic for 9-11, no logic for ISIS. And those barbaric terrorists, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=34.16s)]
*  they unprovoked attacked us. They chose to attack communities and not military bases. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  And today we were exposed to horrible things here in Israel when we found the bodies of young [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=47.44s)]
*  children who were tied and were killed in a brutal manner. Some of them were burnt [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=53.44s)]
*  while they were alive. Some of them were decapitated. Horrible things they did to [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=59.68s)]
*  young children, to women. Those barbarics, we have one thing to do is to eliminate them. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=64.88s)]
*  That's the only thing we can do, and we shouldn't look for any reasoning or explanation [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=70.88s)]
*  because I don't think we can find one. So when you hear the president of the United States and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=74.88s)]
*  others who will push for, at least he did on Saturday, push for just kind of a more moderate [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=81.2s)]
*  tone, I mean obviously condemning what's happening but not moving in right away, when you hear that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  kind of response, when you don't see a huge movement from around the world supporting Israel [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=93.84s)]
*  full-throatedly, I don't know if you saw what Russian President Vladimir Putin put out, but [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=100.08s)]
*  my goodness, it was like milk toast. So when you see that, what does that tell you about what [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=105.76s)]
*  you're up against as a country in terms of defending yourselves? Well, we know we can count only on [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=111.04s)]
*  ourselves, and thanks God we have the ability to protect ourselves. We have a strong army. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=118.32000000000001s)]
*  You know, at the same time we bury the victims and we are in pain. We are also regrouping our [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=123.52000000000001s)]
*  military. We have called the reserves more than 300,000 boys and girls, and we are getting [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=129.44s)]
*  ready to hit back, and we're going to hit them hard. We're going to hunt down the leaders of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=135.6s)]
*  the Hamas, the militants, those who committed the war crimes against our civilian population, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=139.2s)]
*  and they will pay a heavy price. I sit in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  and I can tell you that it will not look nice in Gaza, and I'm calling the people of Gaza to move [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  away from the headquarters of Hamas because we are coming to get them. We will be strong, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=155.12s)]
*  we will be evil, because we know we cannot have mercy on those kind of brutal enemies. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=160.64s)]
*  You know, I know, and I want to ask you if this is still the case, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=167.27999999999997s)]
*  are you still a lieutenant in reserves for the IDF? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=170.88s)]
*  Indeed, indeed. You have very good memory. Would you fight? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=176.32s)]
*  But today my son, my son is a lieutenant, so my son was called, you know, Saturday 6 a.m. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=178.64s)]
*  when the attack started. He left everything and he went down south, and we pray for him and we wish [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  him the best. At my age, I'm not active anymore, but I do participate as a member of the parliament [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=190.0s)]
*  in the Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee, and we are all together here. You know, even now what [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=197.76s)]
*  happened, you don't find any any disputes in Israel. No left or right. We are united to defeat Hamas. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=202.48s)]
*  Tell me the numbers that you anticipate that you're up against, because I was reading some [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=209.12s)]
*  300,000 of the IDF, including your son, as you've just shared, and I do know when all hands are on [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=213.6s)]
*  deck, at least when my father served, he used to say in his later years, they won't call me to the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=220.79999999999998s)]
*  battle lines, but I sure can't help them with a lot of other things, like strategy, and I would [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=225.44s)]
*  imagine you're in that position too. What kind of numbers versus Hamas? How many of them, or do you [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=229.76s)]
*  think they've been fortified from what you've seen? So we know that we're talking about tens of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=235.2s)]
*  thousands of militants, but it's challenging because it's not a military. They are hiding [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=241.52s)]
*  against civilian population. They are committing a double war crime. They attack civilians in Israel, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=246.56s)]
*  and then cowardly, they go and hide behind civilians in Gaza, and they use them as human [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=251.76000000000002s)]
*  shields. So it's challenging, but we have no option. We will have to go there. We're going to [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=256.88s)]
*  have to look for them, and we're going to have to kill them, because you know, after you saw those [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=261.76s)]
*  pictures, it reminded us, you know, horrors from the Holocaust. I don't recall in the last 75 years [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=266.64s)]
*  when you saw people taking Jews out of their homes and killing them in daylight. It was horrible, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=272.8s)]
*  horrible, and we are committed to stop it. Yeah, I opened this hour with something that we have [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=279.12s)]
*  not seen since the middle of the last century, and that's what you're talking about, and one [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=284.8s)]
*  of the family members of the four hostages who gave a news conference, four who've been taken, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  and their families were giving a news conference a couple of hours ago, one of them said, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=295.6s)]
*  compare this to pogroms, which were, of course, leading up to the Holocaust. And so this is a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=300.16s)]
*  situation now where we really have to watch to see if our thirsty enemies, who we have in common [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=306.0s)]
*  in Iran in particular, would want to make this a wider conflict. What are your thoughts on that? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=314.0s)]
*  So we pay very much attention to what's happening in our northern border with Hezbollah. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=320.08s)]
*  That's another proxy of Iran. And I think, you know, no coincidence, we were talking with the [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=328.71999999999997s)]
*  Saudis, with the U.S. to expand the Abraham Accords here in the region, and all of a sudden Hamas [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=334.96s)]
*  attacks us. I think that Iran was not happy to see more peace in the region, and that's why they [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=341.52s)]
*  initiated this brutal attack against Israel, unprovoked. So we advise the Hezbollah not to [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=347.68s)]
*  join this cycle of violence. If they will do that, we will fight hard against them also. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=354.40000000000003s)]
*  And also the Iranians, we know that they are doing things behind the scenes, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=359.68s)]
*  and we can see their fingerprints all over the area. Like what? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=363.52s)]
*  Mainly funding and training. We know that many of the militants of Hamas flew to Tehran [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  to learn about how to use explosives, how to attack our facilities. And for us, you know, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=377.28s)]
*  we are caught by surprise. We have to admit that. In 1973, it happened during the Yom Kippur holiday, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=384.55999999999995s)]
*  and now it was another holiday. We were celebrating the holiday, and we were caught by surprise again. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=392.0s)]
*  But I can assure you that we will win the war. We have no other choice. We are coming together. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  We will prevail. It will not be easy, and we will need the support of the American people [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=402.8s)]
*  to stand with us, to pray for us. But especially when the international community will start to [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=407.28000000000003s)]
*  pressure us to have a ceasefire or will blame us for humanitarian suffering. So we will not [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=412.24s)]
*  listen to them with all due respect. If you are an ally of Israel, you should tell us, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=420.32000000000005s)]
*  finish the job. Do what you have to do. Well, and on the other side of all this, too, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=425.36s)]
*  they have closed their border, and that is Egypt. Interesting. They are closing their border to [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=429.92s)]
*  the very people. I mean, they are Arabs. They do not even want to help the Palestinians coming [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=434.56s)]
*  out of that area. It is really fascinating. I do want to get to this, because you talk about [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=439.6s)]
*  what you did not know coming up, and we know something of that. I mean, obviously, you compared [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=443.28000000000003s)]
*  it to 9-11. I think you would mix in some Pearl Harbor, too, with the stakes that were so high [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=447.76s)]
*  and how they carried this out. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who is expected to be at [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=452.0s)]
*  the White House briefing later today, said this last week about the Middle East. Watch. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=457.68s)]
*  The war in Yemen is in its 19-month of truce. For now, the Iranian attacks against U.S. forces [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  have stopped. Our presence in Iraq is stable. I emphasize for now because all of that can change. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=471.44s)]
*  And the Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=477.04s)]
*  What does that even mean to you? [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=483.28000000000003s)]
*  So, you know, the naivete is something we cannot argue about. But in our region, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=484.96s)]
*  when you have a terrorist organization with using its funds to dig tunnels [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=493.44s)]
*  and to acquire rockets and missiles, they will use it one day. So we were not sure when it [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=498.0s)]
*  will happen and how, but we knew that was the intention. That's why I think this time the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=502.4s)]
*  government must go all the way to eradicate Hamas, not only to hurt the capabilities of Hamas, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=507.44s)]
*  but this time to finish the job, to make sure we can live peacefully. And I think, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=513.52s)]
*  Harris, it would be also good for the Palestinians. They will be able to build their society, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=518.0s)]
*  not under the regime of Hamas, who unfortunately is taking advantage of the Palestinians themselves. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=524.0799999999999s)]
*  Ambassador Danone, thank you for being in focus. Appreciate your expertise. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=530.64s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Y1_jydxoU&t=536.24s)]
