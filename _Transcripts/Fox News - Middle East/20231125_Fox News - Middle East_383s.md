# Issues causing delayed hostage release are resolved: Qatar
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU)
*  Well, Jonathan, we have breaking news. We're just getting word from Qatar negotiators that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=0.0s)]
*  the hostage holdup has been resolved, bringing in now Ambassador Michael Oren, former Israeli [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=5.42s)]
*  ambassador to the U.S., and a member of the Israeli Knesset. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=12.68s)]
*  We're not sure of the details, Ambassador, in terms of exactly when this now kink that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=16.78s)]
*  has been released out of this chain, if you will, when the flow will begin again. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=22.56s)]
*  But you know, you can't really trust Hamas, quite frankly. With this delay in the first [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=27.42s)]
*  place, what message was Hamas sending, and what are they up to at this point? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=33.78s)]
*  So good to be with you, Sal. Hamas is reminding us of who and what it is as a terrorist organization. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=38.46s)]
*  It's like negotiating with ISIS or negotiating with al-Qaeda. And Hamas as a terrorist organization, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=45.86s)]
*  of course, does not, is not an honest negotiator. It's going to move the football. It's going [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=50.94s)]
*  to move the goalposts. And the goal there is not just to terrorize us physically, it's [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=56.42s)]
*  to terrorize Israelis emotionally. And you can imagine what these families are going [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=60.82s)]
*  through, knowing at the last minute everything may fall through, or even that the people [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=64.74s)]
*  who are on the list, or the hostages scheduled to be released, may not be released. And Hamas [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=68.62s)]
*  will do this again and again and again. I'm not the least surprised by this delay, or [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=74.14s)]
*  any delay that's going to occur toward the end of the ceasefire period. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=78.02s)]
*  I mean, Qatar, they don't necessarily have the loved ones on the line and on the line [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=82.7s)]
*  and wanting to get them back into their arms. But they have a lot at stake in terms of putting [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=88.62s)]
*  their themselves very forward-facing on the negotiations. So you'd imagine that the Qatari [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=92.94s)]
*  officials are working diligently to try to get this to continue to run as smoothly as [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=98.62s)]
*  possible, given the circumstances. But where we sit now, where does that portend, or what [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=103.86s)]
*  does that portend for a potential extension to this pause in fighting? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=109.38s)]
*  Just to show you how absurd the situation is, Qatar is the principal backer of Hamas. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  Major Hamas officials live in Qatar. So Qatar is getting it both ways. It's promoting [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=120.22s)]
*  Hamas, promoting the atrocities and horrors of October 7th, promoting the hostage crisis [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=125.38s)]
*  and then getting credit for trying to resolve the hostage crisis. Almost you can't make [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=130.85999999999999s)]
*  this up. So Qatar's line is, its reputation is on the line because if it can't produce [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=134.62s)]
*  that, it can't produce the hostages, it's left with just holding the, we promoted Hamas [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=139.86s)]
*  card, which was not particularly good for Qatar. They're a rife, rife with dangers for [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=147.06s)]
*  the state of Israel. And one of your commenters previously said that Hamas will use this period [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=153.18s)]
*  to reorganize, to rearm, to move troops from the south up north again. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  And Israel has to make the terrible decision of weighing a hostage life against a soldier's [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=162.94s)]
*  life because this is liable, very much liable to cost us in terms of our soldiers lives [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=166.78s)]
*  when the ceasefire renews and even when the fighting renews and getting the fighting [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=170.98s)]
*  renewed is even more problematic because now there's a momentum in the world where the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=176.82s)]
*  world is saying, well, you agreed to this ceasefire. Why not a longer ceasefire? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=180.3s)]
*  And there's even domestic pressure within Israel for that effect. And here's the bottom [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=184.46s)]
*  line. Ceasefire means Hamas gets away with mass murder. Ceasefire means Hamas wins. Ceasefire [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  means that Israel cannot restore its internal security. We have 250,000 refugees inside [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=195.82000000000002s)]
*  the state of Israel who have been moved away from the border. They cannot go back to those [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=202.14000000000001s)]
*  border areas if Hamas is allowed to rearm and mount further attacks. And they have said [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=205.9s)]
*  openly that that is their goal. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=211.9s)]
*  And Israel has also said that once these hostages are released, as many as possible, we hope [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=214.14s)]
*  that the fighting will continue. They've said that part out loud. So it almost begs the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=220.62s)]
*  question. So what's the point of what's happening now? I mean, is it strictly for you believe [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=226.54s)]
*  for Hamas to regroup their forces so they can reorganize so they're a more formidable [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=231.66s)]
*  force against Israeli IDF? But even though IDF says bring it no matter what you do, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=238.54s)]
*  we're coming for you basically. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=243.73999999999998s)]
*  And there's two basic points which have to be stressed here. One is that Hamas wouldn't [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=246.62s)]
*  be negotiating now the way it's negotiating if Israel hadn't moved its ground forces into [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=250.45999999999998s)]
*  Gaza and close that noose around Hamas. They're underground. They've been underground for seven [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=254.94s)]
*  weeks too. They're hardly not fighting at all. They come up, their terrorists come up, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=259.09999999999997s)]
*  shoot an RPG or an anti-tank missile, then they run back down. They're under siege. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=262.7s)]
*  So Hamas is playing for time. It's playing for time and hoping that the international community [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=267.98s)]
*  will increase its pressure on Israel to accept the ceasefire because remember ceasefire means [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=272.22s)]
*  victory. But the second point is the most difficult point. And this is this, brace yourself. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=277.18s)]
*  And that is Hamas will not release all the hostages because it knows once it released the last [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=281.74s)]
*  hostage, that is when Israel will flood those tunnels with seawater or some flammable substance. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  And that will be the end of Hamas. So I think the goal here for Israel is on one hand to get as [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=292.70000000000005s)]
*  many hostages out, particularly the women, children, the elderly, the infirm, and then [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=297.74s)]
*  to renew that pressure on Hamas by restarting the military stage of this battle. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=302.62s)]
*  YAMICHE ALCINDOR-CHAFMANN A conundrum indeed, but again the breaking news is that according to [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=309.02s)]
*  negotiators, the hostages, the second batch or group if you will, of hostages will be released [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=314.3s)]
*  today. Quickly, Ambassador, what do you make of the fact that no Americans are included in [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=319.58s)]
*  this second group? There we go. It's moving the football again. What is Hamas trying to do? It's [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=325.42s)]
*  trying to drive a wedge between the United States and Israel. It's causing, it's raising tensions on [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=332.54s)]
*  the American side. And hopefully the Americans then will put pressure on Israel to extend the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=339.58000000000004s)]
*  ceasefire to get more American prisoners out. You see how this works? Ingenious, right? But evil, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=343.98s)]
*  ingenious, sinister. That's who we're dealing with. They are not an honest negotiator. They're [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=350.22s)]
*  not going to negotiate in good faith. They're a terrorist group and they will terrorize both us [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=356.06s)]
*  and the people of the United States on this holiday weekend. Former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S., [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LsGspuWK6OU&t=361.34000000000003s)]
