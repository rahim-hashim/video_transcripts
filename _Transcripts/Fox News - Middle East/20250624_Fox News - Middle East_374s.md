# This makes Dems go 'ABSOLUTELY CRAZY'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw)
*  President Trump means what he says. Just listen to his words. He's not that hard to figure out. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=0.0s)]
*  You can call it the Trump doctrine if you want, but it is simply a fact. And despite all the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=4.8s)]
*  smears from the state-run legacy media mob, Trump has always called for global peace. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=9.52s)]
*  Sometimes that means you got to get tough with both your enemies and your friends. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=15.52s)]
*  Take a look earlier today. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=19.6s)]
*  Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=21.52s)]
*  the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=25.52s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. You know, when I say, OK, now you have 12 hours, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=29.68s)]
*  you don't go out in the first hour and just drop everything you have on them. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=34.56s)]
*  So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=38.0s)]
*  But I'm really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=41.44s)]
*  that didn't land that was shot, perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. I'm not happy about that. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=46.0s)]
*  You know what? We have — we basically have two countries [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=53.6s)]
*  that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the f— they're doing. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=56.56s)]
*  Do you understand that? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  All right. After a tenuous start, the ceasefire is now back on track. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=63.28s)]
*  Keep in mind, this is a ceasefire less than one week after President Trump obliterated Iran's [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  nuclear program with a massive strike. Take a look at your screen. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=71.84s)]
*  The strike was a tremendous success thanks to several bunker buster bombs that penetrated [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=75.04s)]
*  a mountain and exploded deep underground. Fordow, their nuclear plant, really no longer exists. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=80.4s)]
*  We'll get the full assessment in days ahead. Now, there will be a lot of hard work ahead [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=86.72s)]
*  in terms of achieving a lasting peace. That will include checks and balances and measures in place [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=91.76s)]
*  to prevent Iran from ever rebuilding anything nuclear. This should also include Iran's [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=98.48s)]
*  recognition of Israel and, of course, anywhere, any place, any time inspections. And that would be [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  American inspections. And, of course, a full accounting of all enriched uranium that the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=110.16s)]
*  Iranians may have moved. That has got to be a part of it as well. My message to Iran, tried to warn [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=115.6s)]
*  you before Donald Trump dropped those bunker busters, if you think you will be clever and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=121.2s)]
*  you think you'll be able to use your proxies like Hamas and Bola, the Houthi rebels or others to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=127.12s)]
*  attack Israel, then that war will be back on immediately and Donald Trump will not come to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=132.88s)]
*  the rescue and stop Israel this time. He knows that they are acting on orders from you, the Iranian [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=138.64s)]
*  leadership, or whoever's left. From this point forward, Iran's radical leaders, they are committing [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=144.95999999999998s)]
*  suicide any and every time they dare attack Israel, either directly or indirectly through their proxies. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=150.48s)]
*  But what President Trump has been able to accomplish in the last week is incredible. It is historic. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=157.6s)]
*  So many presidents talked about it. None of them ever did it. And, of course, it is driving the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=163.6s)]
*  Democrats and the media mob predictably absolutely crazy. Instead of congratulations, we are seeing [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=168.48s)]
*  condemnation from the left. Insanely, some are even accusing Donald Trump of committing [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=174.64s)]
*  an illegal act. And even today, 79 Democrats in Congress voted to impeach the president for [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=179.92s)]
*  daring to breach the 1973 War Powers Act, which, as Greg Jarrett points out, quote, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=186.23999999999998s)]
*  it is a notification requirement. And he did notify the leadership on the Democratic side [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=192.4s)]
*  and Republican side in Congress, not a prohibition on the president's right to exert military action. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=198.4s)]
*  And the president did, in fact, notify those people in Congress he needed to notify, just to be clear. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=204.56s)]
*  As Greg Jarrett points out, under Article 2 of the Constitution, the president is the commander-in-chief [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=210.32000000000002s)]
*  of the armed forces, and that empowers him to direct military operations to deter foreign [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=216.88s)]
*  threats to our national security without conferring with Jasmine Crockett. Now, this has been well [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=222.56s)]
*  established over the course of our republic. No president has ever abided by the War Powers Act [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=228.32s)]
*  ever. And the act itself even allows presidents a 60-day window to strike at any enemy if they [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=235.28s)]
*  necessary. On top of that, after 9-11, Congress specifically authorized additional powers [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  for a president, granting explicit power to target nations linked to terrorism. That would be Iran, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=249.35999999999999s)]
*  the number one state sponsor of terror. But if Democrats actually disagree with these facts, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=256.0s)]
*  where then was the outrage? When Joe Biden bombed Afghanistan, Syria, Yemen, or when [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=261.52s)]
*  Barack Obama ordered strikes against Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Pakistan, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=266.88s)]
*  Obama even ordered a drone strike against a U.S. citizen in Yemen, and yet Democrats then didn't [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=274.32s)]
*  care a whit. In fact, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=280.8s)]
*  Jimmy Carter, Gerald Ford, Richard Nixon, Lyndon B. Johnson, all ordered strikes without [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=286.96s)]
*  congressional approval. There's your Hannity history lesson. But Democrats, why let facts [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=292.24s)]
*  get in the way of a great smear campaign against President Trump? They live, eat, breathe, sleep, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=297.2s)]
*  hating Trump. If the dog bites, the beast stings, you're feeling sad, blame Trump. If Trump cures [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=303.36s)]
*  cancer, blame him for that, too. They don't like Donald Trump. They don't like that he has emerged. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=309.6s)]
*  As the real, one true leader of the free world, other presidents only made proclamations about Iran [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=314.64s)]
*  and their nuclear program. Donald Trump brought them to their knees. Other presidents politely [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=321.6s)]
*  encouraged NATO members to, you know, take their defense seriously, pay their fair share. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=327.12s)]
*  Donald Trump got them to start paying their fair share as of today. Other presidents looked the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=332.56s)]
*  other way, while Europe, you know, was piping in oil and gas at lower rates from Russia, you know, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=338.08000000000004s)]
*  funding Putin's war machine, while Donald Trump was calling them out for doing that very thing [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=343.52000000000004s)]
*  and then wanting money for defense. And now, by the way, at the NATO meeting that's going on in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=348.56s)]
*  the Netherlands, Europe's leaders have finally come to the realization that President Trump has [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=352.88s)]
*  been right the entire time about every major issue facing the world. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FXUtyRAk_Pw&t=357.76s)]
