# Grisham responds to criticism of Trump's Soleimani airstrike
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 07, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U)
*  White House Press Secretary Stephanie Grisham is our headliner and joins us now from Washington. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=0.0s)]
*  And Stephanie, welcome back to our program here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=4.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=6.0s)]
*  And a good morning to you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=7.0s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=8.0s)]
*  What is, among the conversations at the White House, what is the expected response, the [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=9.0s)]
*  anticipated response on behalf of Iran? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  That's not something that we would know about, but we're definitely ready for it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=18.68s)]
*  If they choose to retaliate, the president has made clear that we will be ready for that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=22.76s)]
*  Our military is, of course, on high alert, and we'll just see what happens. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=27.44s)]
*  We hope it doesn't happen. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=30.96s)]
*  The president has said he does not seek any kind of an escalation or war, but again, we'll [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=31.96s)]
*  see what happens. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=36.52s)]
*  Can you specify the threats that Soleimani posed against American forces? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=37.52s)]
*  No, that's something. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=43.08s)]
*  It was an intel-based decision, and it saved American lives. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=44.96s)]
*  And I think that that's what's most important. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=48.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people are now questioning the intel. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=49.8s)]
*  That's really unfortunate. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=52.92s)]
*  A lot of people are saying, to what benefit? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=53.92s)]
*  I will answer that question. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=55.96s)]
*  The benefit was we saved American lives. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  We saved members of the military. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=59.52s)]
*  We saved diplomats. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=61.64s)]
*  And we saved a lot of families from having to welcome their loved ones home in coffins. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=63.2s)]
*  How long will you keep it private? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=68.6s)]
*  That is not up to me. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=71.56s)]
*  The members of Congress are being briefed tomorrow, so they'll get to see that. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=72.76s)]
*  I imagine some of those details will leak. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=76.88s)]
*  But again, there's intel that just can't be made public because it's a safety for national [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=78.88s)]
*  security. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=83.4s)]
*  Obviously, the coming minutes, hours, days, everything matters when it comes to the president's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=84.44000000000001s)]
*  next decision with all of this. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=89.68s)]
*  What does this schedule look like? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  Who is he meeting with, and how is he coming up with his next move? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=93.0s)]
*  Well, he's being briefed all of the time. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=96.96000000000001s)]
*  He's talking to his national security team all of the time. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=99.24000000000001s)]
*  He's also continuing on with the job of the president. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=102.12s)]
*  He's going to meet with the Greek prime minister today, and he's got other things that he needs [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=105.68s)]
*  to be doing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=111.2s)]
*  But he's being briefed constantly. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=112.2s)]
*  He is on top of everything, and the country should feel good that this president is not [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=113.32s)]
*  going to let anything happen to anybody. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=118.0s)]
*  Many Republicans, I would say, have supported the move, with one exception. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=120.67999999999999s)]
*  That's Rand Paul. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=124.52s)]
*  At last hour, he told us diplomacy, the possibility of it is now dead. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=125.52s)]
*  To him, you say what? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=130.4s)]
*  I don't know if I agree with that. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=132.56s)]
*  The president has said that he's welcome to talking to them with no preconditions. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=135.0s)]
*  I did see him speak, and I would say that, again, we saved American lives. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=140.52s)]
*  There is nothing that we could have done. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=145.16s)]
*  The alternative was to what? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  Not save these people, and then what would people be saying to us? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=148.52s)]
*  What would Congress be saying? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=151.24s)]
*  What would Nancy Pelosi be saying? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=152.72s)]
*  That we sat by and let something happen to our American troops or our American diplomats. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=154.5s)]
*  Again, we saved lives here, and that was the number one most important thing to this president. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=159.28s)]
*  I know you're not going to go very far on this, but I'm going to try and push you yet [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  again. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=166.36s)]
*  So a deliberate decision to kill him when he was in Iraq, or would you have made the [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=167.36s)]
*  same decision had he been in Damascus or even Tehran? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=171.8s)]
*  I will just say exactly what the president has said, is that we caught him red-handed. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  We caught him in the act. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=181.08s)]
*  It was a targeted strike that eliminated the number one terrorist in this world, and countless [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  lives have been saved, not only by catching him in the act for what he was going to do, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=188.76000000000002s)]
*  but who knows what he was going to do in the future. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=193.02s)]
*  He was not going to stop targeting Americans. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=194.72s)]
*  But were you waiting for him to come back into Baghdad? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=197.8s)]
*  That's not something I'm going to get into. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=201.52s)]
*  How is the president responding behind closed doors to some Democrats suggesting that the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=203.82s)]
*  president made this move to distract from impeachment? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=208.48s)]
*  It's not surprising, but he's staying focused. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=212.4s)]
*  Look, the Democrats are not going to be happy with anything that we do, absolutely anything. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=214.32s)]
*  They should be celebrating that this president took such decisive action to save their Americans. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=218.96s)]
*  Many of whom they represent. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=224.6s)]
*  But again, there's nothing that this president can do that will make them happy. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=226.4s)]
*  It's really unfortunate that they're turning this political. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=230.28s)]
*  This is not political. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=232.48s)]
*  This is not a game. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=233.76s)]
*  This was about American lives. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=234.88s)]
*  What is the president's biggest concern when he weighs his next move? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=236.64s)]
*  Well, of course, collateral damage and people being injured. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=240.72s)]
*  He's going to have to keep that in mind. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=245.6s)]
*  The president has such difficult decisions to make on a daily basis. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=247.84s)]
*  He's been very, very careful, which I think should show that this was an imminent danger [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=252.76s)]
*  to some Americans. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=257.08s)]
*  That is why he acted so decisively. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=258.26s)]
*  He's very, very careful and very thoughtful, and he weighs all of his options very carefully [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=260.8s)]
*  based on intel and based on what his national security team tells him. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=264.86s)]
*  Stephanie, what do you say to American men and women serving overseas as to what they [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  should brace for, and what direction have you given them? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  What we say to them is thank you, as always. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=277.56s)]
*  We say thank you for their bravery and thank you for serving this country. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=279.68s)]
*  And we have every confidence in them. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=283.04s)]
*  We've got the best military in this world. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=285.76s)]
*  We've got the best soldiers. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=288.48s)]
*  All five branches of the military are fantastic. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=289.92s)]
*  They're brave. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=292.88s)]
*  We thank them for what it is that they do every single day. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=293.88s)]
*  The president expressed with Rush Limbaugh in a new interview that there was knowledge [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=296.52s)]
*  of this behavior and intelligence that would have rendered doing this sooner, even in past [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  administrations. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=307.76s)]
*  What is he saying about that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=308.76s)]
*  Yes, I mean, President Obama designated him a terrorist, and then nothing was done. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=310.48s)]
*  In fact, he just sent him cash. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=315.64s)]
*  There probably were missed opportunities, but there's really no need to look in the [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=317.64s)]
*  past. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=321.0s)]
*  We're looking ahead. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=322.0s)]
*  We're looking at what we're doing as this administration. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=323.0s)]
*  The president is focused on what he's doing now. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  And again, he took decisive action, and there was a targeted strike that took out a very, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=327.71999999999997s)]
*  very bad man, a murderer, somebody who targeted Americans constantly, had many, many plans [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=332.59999999999997s)]
*  to kill Americans. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=338.12s)]
*  Let's move from Iran to impeachment. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi sent out this tweet yesterday saying, the president and Senator McConnell [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=341.88s)]
*  have run out of excuses. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=346.04s)]
*  They must allow key witnesses to testify and produce the documents Trump has blocked so [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=347.4s)]
*  Americans can see the facts for themselves. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=351.7s)]
*  The Senate cannot be complicit in the president's cover-up, a hashtag, defend our democracy. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  What is the expectation now that John Bolton said yesterday he would respond to a subpoena [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=360.8s)]
*  and testify in a Senate trial if it comes to that? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4XWYmf7h-4U&t=365.04s)]
