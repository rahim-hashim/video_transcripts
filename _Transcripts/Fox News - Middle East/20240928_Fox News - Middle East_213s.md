# Col. Richard Kemp: Biden should be 'court-martialed' for what he's doing with Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk)
*  We're here with our friend Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=0.0s)]
*  forces in Afghanistan, former chairman of the Cobra intelligence group, a [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  tremendous friend of the United States, a tremendous friend of the state of [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Israel, including the prime minister of Israel, Colonel Kemp, I need your wisdom [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=9.96s)]
*  here. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=14.96s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=16.52s)]
*  The Biden Harris administration is still flowing billions of dollars into Iran. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=19.04s)]
*  Iran is building a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=22.92s)]
*  They haven't lifted a finger to stop them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Iran is behind all the horrific attacks against the state of Israel, who I [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=27.0s)]
*  thought was our ally. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=30.68s)]
*  Atrocious, atrocious casualties occurred on citizens. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=32.64s)]
*  The citizens are the target of Hamas, the Houthis and Hezbollah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=36.24s)]
*  Hezbollah began firing missiles, unprovoked, no territorial disputes from [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=41.2s)]
*  Lebanon the day after October 7th, the day after Hamas. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=47.2s)]
*  So it's obviously coordinated with their terrorist coalition. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=51.32s)]
*  And after 9,000 missiles have landed into towns and cities in Israel, Israel [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=55.32s)]
*  said, you know what? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=59.24s)]
*  Biden and Harris have had 11 months to negotiate their diplomatic deal like they [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=60.88s)]
*  did so brilliantly in Afghanistan and they've done so brilliantly with Hamas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  And they did so brilliantly with Russia as they are with China and Taiwan. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=68.6s)]
*  We need to defend the homeland. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=72.48s)]
*  We need to defend the homeland. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=74.12s)]
*  And that's exactly what they're doing now. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=75.52s)]
*  And today, Colonel, Biden and Harris are undermining Netanyahu with Macron of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=77.36s)]
*  France. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=83.56s)]
*  Instead of focused on helping them defeat Hezbollah, can you make any sense of [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=86.08s)]
*  this, sir? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=89.96000000000001s)]
*  It makes no sense at all to me. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=91.2s)]
*  I said on this program a while back after Biden and Harris's [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  horrific withdrawal from Afghanistan, I said that President Biden should have [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  been court-martialed for that, for pulling the U.S. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  forces out of Afghanistan, abandoning a U.S. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=106.68s)]
*  ally. And I think he should be court-martialed for what he's doing with Iran now as [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=109.32000000000001s)]
*  well, because he's been encouraging Iran, he's been funding Iran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=112.84s)]
*  He's been in many ways helping Iran to attack Israel. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=116.64s)]
*  And Israel is probably one of the most important American allies in the world. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=120.72s)]
*  What's what's Biden doing? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=125.96000000000001s)]
*  He is withholding arms, important arms from Israel. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=127.48s)]
*  And that includes two thousand pound bombs, which Israel needs to destroy [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=137.52s)]
*  Hezbollah, like Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah has a very extensive tunnel [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=139.32000000000002s)]
*  system in Lebanon. You can't destroy that without that kind of munitions. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  They've asked for helicopters. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  They've been declined. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=149.08s)]
*  They've not been delivered at all. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=150.88000000000002s)]
*  And also very important armored bulldozers, which are essential to fighting [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=152.96s)]
*  Hezbollah as they've been to fighting Hamas. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=157.56s)]
*  And yet the United States is withholding this vital equipment from [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  Israel. And you raised it yourself. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=164.84s)]
*  You first, I think you were the first person really to highlight the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=166.44s)]
*  kind of de facto arms embargo on Israel that Biden put in place. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=171.08s)]
*  And that is absolutely shocking. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=176.16s)]
*  It was shocking. And now it's just got worse. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=178.08s)]
*  The list has been added to, as we've been learning from some of the very good [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=179.88s)]
*  work that's been done by the likes of Senator Cotton in the Senate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=184.44s)]
*  And it's not just it's not just withholding munitions. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  That is that is a crime enough, in my view, of its own. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=191.84s)]
*  It's also not giving Israel support in other areas where it really does need it. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAXVKDiHrkk&t=196.08s)]
