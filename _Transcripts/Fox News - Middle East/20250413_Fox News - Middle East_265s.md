# 'PRO-PEACE': Trump Iran talks could signal 'most significant' Middle East reformation
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM)
*  The lines of communication still open with the US and Iran as talks between Trump administration and the regime are expected to resume next Saturday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=0.0s)]
*  White House calling the talks quote positive and constructive and a step forward in achieving a mutually beneficial [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=8.24s)]
*  Outcome our next guest says that if a deal is made it could herald the biggest Mideast reformation of a lifetime [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  Attorney Julian Epstein served his former chief counsel for the House Judiciary Committee. He joins us now. Thanks so much for joining us this morning [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=22.88s)]
*  You know Julian you wrote a really fascinating piece in the New York Post [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=29.0s)]
*  And I want to just sort of step back and do a big picture thing here [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=33.88s)]
*  How extraordinary is it that you actually have an American administration? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=37.72s)]
*  engaging directly with Iran in the first place [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=43.56s)]
*  Well, it's exceptional, but I think it's welcome and it's certainly welcome after the failed [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=47.64s)]
*  Obama-Biden approach of de-escalation and appeasement of Iran [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=52.760000000000005s)]
*  I think what Trump is saying is and the Trump administration is saying very directly [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=56.96s)]
*  Which is it's time to cut out the nonsense. You don't have very many options Iran [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=63.24s)]
*  You can either completely denuclearize or we'll do it for you [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=67.64s)]
*  And I think he I think Iran understands that Trump is strong [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=71.72s)]
*  I think they understand that he means it by deterrence and would use force if need be or at least free Israel to use [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=76.52s)]
*  force and I think [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=84.26s)]
*  You know sort of the Trump administration is holding most of the cards here [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=86.5s)]
*  Yeah, so obviously it's a high stakes gamble and there's a reason nobody wants to engage with Iran generally speaking [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  But you you talk about how this could be the most significant [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=98.02000000000001s)]
*  Reformation of the Middle East, you know bigger even than the Abraham Accords [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=101.86s)]
*  How does that how does that play out in a in a in a positive direction? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=106.54s)]
*  Well, let me explain it Charlie [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=111.18s)]
*  What we were just referring to is the use of hard power which the administration has as an option and can free Israel to do [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=112.86s)]
*  but what's more interesting that's going on right now is what seems to be the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=120.66s)]
*  Really clever use of soft power by the Trump administration and if three things occur [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=125.58s)]
*  I think we could see the most significant pro-peace [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=131.68s)]
*  pro-west [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=134.98s)]
*  Reformation in the Middle East of our lifetime the three things would have to be if we get a Ukraine deal [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=135.94s)]
*  Which I think we are going to get part of that deal has got to include the decoupling of Russia from Iran [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=142.26s)]
*  Fast and for various reasons Russia wants that if you look at what happened to the ruble last week, Charlie the ruble crashed [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=149.45999999999998s)]
*  It could go be going through another devaluation what Russia needs more than anything else right now is [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=156.34s)]
*  Engagement with the Western economies and access to the Western economy. So that's the first thing. The second thing is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=162.34s)]
*  Cleaving the relationship between Iran and China and you can almost all of Iran's oil [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=169.6s)]
*  95% of it is exported to China [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=176.68s)]
*  You can sanction that out of existence tomorrow if you wanted to through Western sanctions [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=178.92s)]
*  The Israelis could also take out about the 20 to 25 tankers that deliver the oil from Iran to China on a daily basis [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=184.4s)]
*  So that's the second thing but the third most important thing Charlie is [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=192.04s)]
*  Is [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=195.4s)]
*  The Saudis the Saudis want a defense pact with the United States [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=196.6s)]
*  They want it so badly that they've promised an extraordinary 1.4 trillion dollars in investments in the US in the next four years [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=201.48000000000002s)]
*  And if we can get that Saudi deal ratified by the Senate part of that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=209.08s)]
*  Deal would have to include an economic relationship [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=214.68s)]
*  With Israel and most of the moderate states Charlie would probably fall in line with a Saudi [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=217.84s)]
*  Israeli US sort of forward-looking modern [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=225.44s)]
*  modern [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=230.44s)]
*  worldview [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=231.88s)]
*  Because most of these economies want to grow all of these things combined would isolate Iran and I think would be a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=233.16s)]
*  Reformation worthy of a Nobel Prize if Trump can pull it off [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=240.04s)]
*  Truly extraordinary and a great way that you just broke it all down very simply obviously [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a complex situation, but thank you so much for for doing that for us. I do have me Charlie. Yes, sir [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2k0VpTK-PM&t=249.32s)]
