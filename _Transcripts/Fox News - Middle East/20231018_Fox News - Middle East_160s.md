# Biden speaks from Israel after meeting with Netanyahu
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE)
*  I remember the first time that I was in Israel with Golda Meir. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=0.0s)]
*  She was just before the Six-Day War. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=7.0s)]
*  And she was telling me how terrible everything was, which it was. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=10.0s)]
*  She kept flipping the maps up and down behind her, and all of a sudden she looked at me and she said, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=16.0s)]
*  Would you like a photograph? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=21.0s)]
*  And I thought, that's unusual. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=24.0s)]
*  And she just got up and walked out there, who were outside her office. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=26.0s)]
*  And we're standing there having a photograph taken, like you and I are standing there looking at the press. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=30.0s)]
*  And without looking at me, she turned like this and said, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=35.0s)]
*  You look worried, Senator. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=39.0s)]
*  And I said, I am. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=42.0s)]
*  She said, Don't worry. We Jews have a secret weapon in our fight. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=43.0s)]
*  We have no place else to go. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=48.0s)]
*  Well, the truth of the matter is, if there weren't an Israel, we'd have to invent one. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=52.0s)]
*  The truth of the matter is that I believe that, as I went home and said, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=58.0s)]
*  I got in trouble at the time, but it's true. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=63.0s)]
*  You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=67.0s)]
*  You don't have to be a Jew to be a Zionist. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=70.0s)]
*  And I think the security and safety of Jews worldwide is anchored in the continued vibrance of the State of Israel. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=73.0s)]
*  That's what I think it's about at its core. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=80.0s)]
*  And so I've admired you all, this country, for so long. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=83.0s)]
*  And I'm convinced that more people know your responses to what's happening, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=90.0s)]
*  as opposed to just what war and peace is about. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=98.0s)]
*  The more they're going to be kind of embraced, embraces you. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=102.0s)]
*  And, but, a lot more to say, but I'd like to talk to you in private if I can. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=106.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=112.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=115.0s)]

*  Thanks, guys. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=127.0s)]
*  I was shown by my defense. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gUBWVk6QurE&t=129.0s)]
