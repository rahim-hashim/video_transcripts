# Hannity: The Middle East is on the verge of imploding
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0)
*  Welcome to Hannity and this is a Fox News alert. America and the world, they are on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=0.0s)]
*  edge tonight. A large fire now burns outside the U.S. embassy, that is in Beirut, as the [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=5.68s)]
*  entire Middle East is on the verge of imploding. And tonight, Iran. They are now threatening [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=11.32s)]
*  to involve themselves directly in this conflict. If that happens, all bets are off and the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=16.48s)]
*  entire Middle East could in fact potentially get involved. Back in Gaza, hundreds are dead [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  after a blast at a local hospital. And what the IDF says is the result of a misfired rocket [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=27.6s)]
*  from the terror group, the Islamic Jihad. They have the intelligence to back up their [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=34.2s)]
*  claim. They have phone conversations and I would assume that will be released in time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=40.160000000000004s)]
*  According to the editor in chief of the Jerusalem Post, there are reports that the IDF is in [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=45.36s)]
*  possession of quote, a recording of a conversation between Islamic Jihad terrorists confirming [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=50.24s)]
*  that they launched the rocket that hit the Gaza hospital. Meanwhile, Joe Biden, your [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=55.92s)]
*  president, will soon be headed to Israel with the leaders of Egypt, Jordan and the somewhat [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=61.400000000000006s)]
*  moderate Palestinian Fatah party. They have all canceled their meetings with Joe, which [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=67.44s)]
*  is nothing but a complete humiliation for our country and especially the president of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=74.14s)]
*  United States. The world unfortunately sees what we all see and that is a weak, a frail, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=79.92s)]
*  cognitive mess president pretending to be influential. This, let there be no doubt, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=85.12s)]
*  this is a slap in the face to our president, Joe Biden. The Arab world is now blaming America [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  and Israel for the apparent rocket attack on the hospital in Gaza. So is the Hamas caucus [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=96.92s)]
*  in Congress, led by, well, pretty radical, virulently anti-Semitic at times, Congresswoman [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  to leave. More on that in a moment. That's now a provable lie. Also breaking tonight, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=111.48s)]
*  a big new update from the battle for speaker and a message that I have to Republicans tonight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=116.72s)]
*  Plus, I'll have another message for Hakeem Jeffries, AOC and other radical Democrats. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  They are trying actively now to sabotage Republicans and upend the entire balance of power in the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=127.36s)]
*  House of Representatives. We'll also bring you the latest from around the country and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=133.72s)]
*  worldwide where anti-Semitism and terrorist threats are now surging. One lawmaker is calling [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=138.12s)]
*  on the Department of Homeland Security to deport foreign nationals who have demonstrated [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=144.44s)]
*  support for Hamas. Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas will be here. He will join us with more. It [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=149.0s)]
*  is hard to believe, but there are thousands upon thousands of people living in our country, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=154.84s)]
*  this country, who are now openly praising a terrorist organization and its barbaric [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=160.1s)]
*  attack last weekend. Coming up, Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz will weigh in. Anti-Semitic [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=165.28s)]
*  students at his alma mater are now seeking donations to support, quote, their mental [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=171.32s)]
*  health after they faced a backlash and criticism for supporting Hamas, the terrorist group. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=176.76s)]
*  I advise every American, do not donate a penny. Why? Harvard has billions and billions of [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=183.76s)]
*  dollars socked away. Let them pay for the mental health treatment of their ignorant [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=192.32s)]
*  student body. But tonight's top story, yet again, under Biden's so-called leadership, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  another crisis at home and abroad. How did we get here? Three years ago, there was peace [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=202.04s)]
*  in the Middle East, Israel and the Arab world. They were actually working together in a way [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=206.88s)]
*  that I never thought I'd see in our lifetime. You had the United States, you had Israel, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=211.44s)]
*  you had Jordan, you had Egypt, you had Saudi Arabia, you had the Emirates all aligned together [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=216.08s)]
*  to battle against Iranian hegemony in the region. Thanks to the Abraham Accords, Iran [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=222.88000000000002s)]
*  was isolated. Financially, they were destitute. They were unable to fund a terror war on a [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=228.96s)]
*  massive scale. On top of that, Donald Trump took out a man by the name of Soleimani, the [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=234.36s)]
*  architect of many terror attacks, including the killing of Americans in Iraq and elsewhere. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=239.96s)]
*  That all seems now like a distant memory. As we speak to the region, it is in chaos. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=244.94s)]
*  It is not a mystery as to why. After getting sworn in, the Biden administration almost [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=250.14s)]
*  immediately, frankly inexplicably, well, they eased sanctions against Iran. Tens of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=255.34s)]
*  billions of dollars in oil revenue began pouring in. And can you guess what the mullahs of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=260.66s)]
*  Iran, what do you think they might have done with that money? They spent it on their favorite [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=265.86s)]
*  That's right, terrorism. They are the number one state sponsor of terrorism. And that means [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=270.98s)]
*  supporting terrorist groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic Jihad. They sent weapons, they [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=275.38s)]
*  sent rockets, they sent bombs. They even sent the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to prepare [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=281.54s)]
*  this attack in Gaza. And earlier tonight, a rocket blew up at this hospital in Gaza, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=286.5s)]
*  killing hundreds of innocent people. It was a misfired rocket. It was intended for Israel [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=291.98s)]
*  from the terrorist group Islamic Jihad, according to IDF Intelligence, that they are now sharing [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=297.66s)]
*  with the world. But Iran's bloodlust is apparently not over. We now have tonight one high-ranking [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=303.1s)]
*  Iranian official is now threatening a preemptive strike against Israel in the coming hours. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=309.22s)]
*  So is Israel on the brink of not only a two-front war, but a three-front war? You know, are [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=315.86s)]
*  we really hours away from a much bigger conflict that could literally engulf the entire Middle [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=321.18s)]
*  East? Will the U.S. be dragged into another global conflict and war? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sv963YE0Te0&t=326.58s)]
