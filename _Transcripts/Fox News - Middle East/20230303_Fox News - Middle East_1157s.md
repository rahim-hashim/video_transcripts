# Vivek Ramaswamy at CPAC 2023: 'I'm all in on America first'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc)
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome co-founder, Strive Asset Management, Vivek Premaswamy. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you guys. Thank you for the warm welcome. I've been walking the halls. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=25.0s)]
*  I feel like a lot of you know me this year. And then every fifth person comes up and says, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=29.0s)]
*  are you Cash Patel? And I'm like, no, no, no. I'm still, they still don't know me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=33.0s)]
*  So it's good to be back. I'm going to tell you a little bit about my story from a few years ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=40.0s)]
*  When I had to make a choice, okay, this is going to be a speech about choice, by the way. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=44.0s)]
*  I had to make a choice in 2020. This is back when I was a biotech CEO. It was a multi-billion dollar company. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=49.0s)]
*  I'd founded, I'd built it from scratch. But in 2020, after George Floyd died, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=55.0s)]
*  I was expected to make a statement in favor of the Black Lives Matter movement. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=60.0s)]
*  It was a choice. I chose not to do it. I said that our purpose as a company is to make medicines, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=67.0s)]
*  to make products and services for people who need them. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=74.0s)]
*  But that was the beginning of a six-month journey that culminated about six months later [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=77.0s)]
*  in three prominent advisors to my company resigning. And I had to make a choice. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=83.0s)]
*  Was I going to speak through the filter of corporate self-interest, or was I going to speak freely as a citizen? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=88.0s)]
*  And from that moment forward, I chose to speak freely as a citizen. Thank you. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=98.0s)]
*  I wrote Woke, Inc. I wrote Nation of Victims. I traveled the country calling out the woke industrial complex in America. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=106.0s)]
*  I started a new company called Strive to take on BlackRock and the ESG movement through the market itself, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=113.0s)]
*  saying that it's not their job to tell us to use our dollars in how we live our lives. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=120.0s)]
*  I called out the three secular religions in America that have America in a chokehold today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=125.0s)]
*  The first of them is this woke racial religion that says your identity is based on your skin color, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=132.0s)]
*  that if you're black, you're inherently disadvantaged, that if you're white, you're inherently privileged, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=138.0s)]
*  no matter your economic background or your upbringing, that your race determines who you are and what you can achieve in life. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=144.0s)]
*  It's one that Congresswoman Iona Presley of the Squad summed up really well when she said, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=151.0s)]
*  I don't want any more brown faces that don't want to be a brown voice. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=157.0s)]
*  I do not fit her description of what counts as a brown voice, I assure you that. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=162.0s)]
*  But it is a really clever move in this religion, which is this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=166.0s)]
*  If your race goes from being about your skin color to being about the content of the ideas you're allowed to espouse, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=170.0s)]
*  then any disagreement with those ideas automatically makes you a racist. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=177.0s)]
*  And there is no greater damnation in modern America than to be called a racist. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=181.0s)]
*  So when given the choice between pledging allegiance to this new religion and being tarred with the scarlet R, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=186.0s)]
*  that's when everyday Americans started to bend the knee. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=193.0s)]
*  And that's what created this new culture of fear in America when it then combined with the second religion. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=197.0s)]
*  That's a new secular religion in America that says the sex of the person you're attracted to [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=203.0s)]
*  has to be hardwired on the day you were born, it had to be or else it couldn't be a civil right, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=210.0s)]
*  but your own biological sex is completely fluid over the course of your lifetime. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=215.0s)]
*  It makes no sense unless it's a religion. It doesn't match up to reason, it matches up to religion. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=221.0s)]
*  And then it makes the same move as the first religion. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=225.0s)]
*  Well, you know what? Peter Thiel, who's a man who's attracted to men, the Advocate Magazine, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=228.0s)]
*  one of the leading LGBTQIA plus magazines, said that Peter Thiel is not gay after he spoke at the RNC, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=232.0s)]
*  because he did not represent the gay voice. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=239.0s)]
*  So now you're starting to see a pattern, which then brings us to the doorstep of the third religion [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=244.0s)]
*  that has America in a chokehold, and that is the newest one that looks like it's here to stay [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=249.0s)]
*  until we do something about it, and we will. That is the climate religion in America [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=253.0s)]
*  that says that we have to fight carbon emissions at all costs in the United States [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=258.0s)]
*  while we shift those same carbon emissions to places like China that supposedly, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=265.0s)]
*  even if you believe in this religion, you would have embraced nuclear energy, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=270.0s)]
*  which is the best form of carbon-free energy production known to mankind, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=273.0s)]
*  and yet these people oppose nuclear energy. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=278.0s)]
*  What's really going on is that the climate religion has about as much to do with the climate [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=281.0s)]
*  as the Spanish Inquisition had to do with Christ, which is to say nothing at all. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=286.0s)]
*  It is about power, dominion, control, punishment, and apologizing for what we have achieved [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=290.0s)]
*  in this country and the modern West as we know it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=296.0s)]
*  So the real question is what's going on? What the heck is going on in our country [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=303.0s)]
*  where these same religions, not religions of Christ, different religions, arise at the same time? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=306.0s)]
*  What's really going on here? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=312.0s)]
*  The answer is that we are in the middle of a national identity crisis in America. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=314.0s)]
*  We are so hungry. Take it from me. I'm 37 years old. I'm a millennial. I was born in 1985. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=320.0s)]
*  I will tell you this. My generation, really every generation of Americans today, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=326.0s)]
*  we're so hungry for a cause. We're hungry for purpose and meaning and identity. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=330.0s)]
*  At a point in our national history when the things that used to fill our hunger for purpose [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=338.0s)]
*  faith, patriotism, hard work, family, these things have disappeared. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=343.0s)]
*  We're hungry to be part of something bigger than ourselves, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=352.0s)]
*  yet we cannot even answer the question of what it means to be an American today. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=356.0s)]
*  This is an opportunity for the GOP. This is an opportunity for the conservative movement [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=362.0s)]
*  to rise to the occasion and fill that void with a vision of American national identity [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=368.0s)]
*  that runs so deep that it dilutes this woke poison to irrelevance. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=374.0s)]
*  I am all in on the America First agenda. Believe me, I'm an America First conservative. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=380.0s)]
*  I will not apologize for it, but to put America first, we now need to rediscover what America is, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=388.0s)]
*  and that is why last week I announced my run for US president to deliver a national identity [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=397.0s)]
*  that we are missing in this country. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=404.0s)]
*  So what does it mean to be an American? It means you believe in merit, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=410.0s)]
*  that you get ahead in this country not on the color of your skin, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=415.0s)]
*  but on the content of your character and your contributions, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=419.0s)]
*  and that is why as US president I have pledged to get rid of affirmative action in this country once and for all. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=422.0s)]
*  It is a national cancer on our soul, and we are done with it. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=430.0s)]
*  It came into existence by an executive order from Lyndon Johnson. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=435.0s)]
*  Every president since Lyndon Johnson could have crossed it out. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=439.0s)]
*  I love the man I'm going to come and talk to about in a second, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=443.0s)]
*  but I'm going to tell you, cross that out, we're done with affirmative action in America. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=446.0s)]
*  That's the first thing. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=451.0s)]
*  But back to the question, what does it mean to be American? [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=453.0s)]
*  This is the question. It means we believe that the people who we elect to run the government, whoever it is, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=456.0s)]
*  ought to be the people who actually run the government. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=464.0s)]
*  Radical idea in America. Who would have ever thought? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=469.0s)]
*  It's not the case today. So the next time we have an Anthony Fauci, or a Merrick Garland, or a James Comey, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=473.0s)]
*  who goes far beyond their constitutional scope, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=480.0s)]
*  you need to do what a chief executive in this country is constitutionally empowered to do. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=484.0s)]
*  You fire them, you fire their employees, you fire the managerial industrial complex around them. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=489.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you this even further. Thank you very much. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=496.0s)]
*  We got to go one step further than that. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=500.0s)]
*  Because when a managerial cancer gets so bad in this country, you can't just reform that from on high. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=502.0s)]
*  I come from the private sector. I know this. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=509.0s)]
*  If you tell me that somebody works for me and I can't fire them, that means that they don't work for me. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=511.0s)]
*  It means I work for them. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=516.0s)]
*  It means I am their slave because I am responsible for what they do without having any power to determine it. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=518.0s)]
*  Well, that can't be the position that the U.S. president is put in. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=524.0s)]
*  When a managerial cancer gets so bad, you have one option left in this country. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=527.0s)]
*  You have to shut it down. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=532.0s)]
*  As I've already said last week, the first agency we will shut down and need to shut down in the United States is the U.S. Department of Education. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=534.0s)]
*  It has no reason to exist. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=542.0s)]
*  Never should have existed. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=546.0s)]
*  Make a mistake. It's better late than never. You shut it down. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=549.0s)]
*  And today I'm ready to announce the second government agency that I will shut down in this country. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=552.0s)]
*  We should have done it 60 years ago. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=558.0s)]
*  It's her Republicans and Democrats alike. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=560.0s)]
*  We're going to get it done. It's finally time to shut down the FBI in America. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=562.0s)]
*  Create something new to take its place because we are done with the J. Edgar Hoover legacy to let this be a self-governing nation again. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=568.0s)]
*  What does it mean to be American? It means you believe in the rule of law. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=580.0s)]
*  Okay, the people who enter this country better down well come through the front door because your first act of entering this country cannot be a law-breaking act. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=583.0s)]
*  It cannot be a law-breaking one. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=591.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you this as a kid of immigrants, that is not racist. That is what it means to be American. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=593.0s)]
*  It means that you believe the military in this country protects our border rather than somebody else's border halfway around the world. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=598.0s)]
*  It means you put American interests first. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=610.0s)]
*  You know, talk about a legitimate use of the U.S. military. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=614.0s)]
*  You're going to call the Mexican cartels a drug terrorist organization? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=617.0s)]
*  Treat them like a terrorist organization. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=621.0s)]
*  We can do it to Bin Laden. We can do it to Soleimani. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=623.0s)]
*  We can do it to the Mexican drug cartels south of the border. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=626.0s)]
*  That is how we end the fentanyl epidemic in this country. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=630.0s)]
*  If the military does one thing, it protects the soil we live on, not somebody else's soil. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=635.0s)]
*  That too is what it means to be American. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=640.0s)]
*  You know what it means to be American? It means you believe in the Declaration of Independence. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=643.0s)]
*  It means you believe in 1776. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=646.0s)]
*  The Declaration of Independence of today is our Declaration of Independence from China. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=648.0s)]
*  If Thomas Jefferson were alive today, that is the Declaration of Independence he would sign. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=657.0s)]
*  That is the Declaration of Independence I will sign if I'm elected as your next president. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=662.0s)]
*  Because you know what? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=666.0s)]
*  We are in trouble when we have a codependent relationship with our enemy. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=667.0s)]
*  The Soviet Union, they never put the shoes on our feet. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=673.0s)]
*  They never put the phones in our pocket. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=676.0s)]
*  We're in a codependent relationship with our enemy and codependent relationships do not end well. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=678.0s)]
*  The only question is who ends it first. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=683.0s)]
*  The sooner we end it, the better for us. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=686.0s)]
*  The later we end it, the better for them. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=689.0s)]
*  And I think it is finally to say we are done with relying on an enemy to power our modern way of life. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=692.0s)]
*  Some of this is going to be easy. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=699.0s)]
*  It's the easy stuff. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=701.0s)]
*  Abandon climate religion, the climate religion that shackles the United States while leaving China untouched. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=703.0s)]
*  I don't know why more Republicans can't just say that aloud. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=711.0s)]
*  It's a thing you're not supposed to say. It's a sacred cow. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=714.0s)]
*  You take that sacred cow to the slaughterhouse where it belongs. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=716.0s)]
*  Climate religion is about actually shackling America itself. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=719.0s)]
*  Some of this stuff is easy. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=723.0s)]
*  They send the fentanyl across our southern border. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=725.0s)]
*  They send the digital fentanyl through TikTok, financial fentanyl in the form of the national debt that's created this addictive relationship to China. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=727.0s)]
*  We declare independence. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=735.0s)]
*  We're done with financial fentanyl, digital fentanyl, actual fentanyl. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=737.0s)]
*  Some of this stuff we can agree on. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=740.0s)]
*  Now, I appreciate the applause, but I also want to be really honest with you. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=742.0s)]
*  My number one opposition, I'm nine days into this presidential campaign, [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=746.0s)]
*  and the number one opposition I get to what I just told you actually comes from the Republican Party, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=751.0s)]
*  a wing of the Republican Party that is so addicted to buying cheap stuff from China and expanding into the Chinese market [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=756.0s)]
*  that they're not ready to make that short-run sacrifice. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=763.0s)]
*  I go further. I think it's important to be honest. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=767.0s)]
*  If we want to declare independence from China, that means we've got to be willing to ban most U.S. businesses [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=769.0s)]
*  from doing business in China until the CCP falls or until the CCP radically reforms itself, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=775.0s)]
*  because there is no easy way out other than taking that Band-Aid and ripping it right off. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=782.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, Henry Kissinger, we're done with your experiment in America. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=788.0s)]
*  It is the only way out. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=794.0s)]
*  We've got to start thinking on the time scales of history, not the time scales of electoral cycles. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=796.0s)]
*  We don't need Chamberlain. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=801.0s)]
*  We need a little bit of Churchill in this country. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=802.0s)]
*  And you know what? If you're willing to make a sacrifice, the chances are you'll never have to make it [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=804.0s)]
*  because the other side will fall first. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=810.0s)]
*  And you can be willing to make a sacrifice if you know what you are sacrificing for. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=813.0s)]
*  And that is this thing we call America. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=820.0s)]
*  Our inner animal spirit, it has been domesticated. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=824.0s)]
*  It has been tamed by this new culture that embraces victimhood and rejects excellence. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=829.0s)]
*  Our inner animal, it has left oceans to lift up places like China on the other side of the world, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=836.0s)]
*  while their culture of Maoist victimhood came back to hold us down. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=841.0s)]
*  I'll tell you this. When we rallied behind the cry to make America great again, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=847.0s)]
*  we did not just hunger for a single man. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=853.0s)]
*  We hungered for the unapologetic pursuit of excellence. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=857.0s)]
*  That is what it means to be an American. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=861.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=864.0s)]
*  I want to do something tonight. I want to address the, I love the boisterous side, [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=870.0s)]
*  I want to address it actually directly. I believe in free speech. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=874.0s)]
*  Free speech is what it means to be American. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=876.0s)]
*  So even if you disagree with what I was saying, stand up and say it because you deserve to. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=878.0s)]
*  This is the country we live in for a reason. Let me address it right away. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=882.0s)]
*  You're going to hear tomorrow night from my good friend, Donald Trump, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=886.0s)]
*  a man who I took inspiration from to do what I am doing now. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=890.0s)]
*  If he hadn't done what he did in 2015 and 2016 as an outsider to come and shake up the system, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=894.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have even thought about doing what I'm doing today and running for president. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=901.0s)]
*  That's just a fact. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=905.0s)]
*  Now, next six months, it's possible as this goes, you know, we'll get a little bit of name calling, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=907.0s)]
*  and you know what? That's part of a, what do you say, locker room talk, a little bit of trash talk on the court. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=913.0s)]
*  You've got to have some fun and handle it, but I think if you can handle a little bit of name calling in this [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=920.0s)]
*  or have some fun, you probably shouldn't be the person sitting across the table [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=924.0s)]
*  representing this country in front of Xi Jinping either. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=927.0s)]
*  But I will tell you something about my friend. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=930.0s)]
*  He is misunderstood across this country. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=933.0s)]
*  I know him. He cares deeply about national unity. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=936.0s)]
*  I know you care deeply about national unity. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=942.0s)]
*  I'm running for president because I care deeply about national unity. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=945.0s)]
*  But here's the question. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=950.0s)]
*  This is the question for the next year and a half in the conservative movement, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=952.0s)]
*  in the Republican Party, and in America. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=956.0s)]
*  Do we want a national divorce or do we want a national revival? [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=961.0s)]
*  It's not going to happen automatically. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=968.0s)]
*  Whatever it is, it is going to be what we choose it to be. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=970.0s)]
*  That is the question today. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=974.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you, here's how we're not going to get national unity. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=976.0s)]
*  We're not going to get national unity with somebody showing up in the proverbial middle saying, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=979.0s)]
*  hey, can't we all hold hands, compromise, get along, kumbaya? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=984.0s)]
*  No, that ain't happening. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=987.0s)]
*  That ship has sailed long ago. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=988.0s)]
*  You want national unity? [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=990.0s)]
*  Here's how you get national unity. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=992.0s)]
*  You get national unity in this country by embracing the extremism, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=994.0s)]
*  the radicalism of the ideals that set this nation into motion 250 years ago. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1000.0s)]
*  Merit, free speech, open debate, self-governance over aristocracy. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1010.0s)]
*  These are radical ideas. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1017.0s)]
*  Most of human history, it was done the other way. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1018.0s)]
*  Old world Europe didn't do it this way. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1020.0s)]
*  We did it this way for a reason because we're different. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1022.0s)]
*  We're Americans. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1024.0s)]
*  And if we embrace that, that is our formula to actually deliver, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1025.0s)]
*  I think, the most unifying thing we could deliver for the country in 2024, and it's this. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1030.0s)]
*  Don't believe it when they tell you it's about Republicans and Democrats. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1036.0s)]
*  Artificial distinctions. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1040.0s)]
*  What really matters in this country is a battle between the managerial class [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1041.0s)]
*  and the everyday citizen, between the great reset and the great uprising, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1046.0s)]
*  between the pro-American movement, do you believe in this country [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1051.0s)]
*  and are you willing to stand for it, or the anti-American movement, [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1054.0s)]
*  which apologizes what this country stands for. [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1058.0s)]
*  And here's the good news I have for you. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1061.0s)]
*  When you divide it up that way, instead of Republicans and Democrats, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1063.0s)]
*  you've got an 80-20 in our favor. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1067.0s)]
*  And you know what's happened in 2024? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1070.0s)]
*  You mark my words, I predict a 1980-style, 1984-style landslide election in this country. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1072.0s)]
*  If we get it right, that is the single most unifying thing [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1080.0s)]
*  we could deliver for our nation going forward. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1083.0s)]
*  I'll tell you this, for the last 10, 20 years in America, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1086.0s)]
*  we have celebrated our diversity and our differences so much that we forgot all the ways we're the same. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1089.0s)]
*  Well, you know what? Revive the ways that we are the same. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1097.0s)]
*  Diversity is not our strength. Our strength is what unifies us across our diversity. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1100.0s)]
*  And you mark my words, that won the American Revolution. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1106.0s)]
*  It reunited us after the Civil War. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1109.0s)]
*  It won us two World Wars and the Cold War. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1111.0s)]
*  It could still be hope for the free world. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1113.0s)]
*  And if we can revive that over fractious group identity, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1116.0s)]
*  then nobody in the world is going to defeat us. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1119.0s)]
*  That is American exceptionalism. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1121.0s)]
*  Thank you very much. God bless you. God bless our great country. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1123.0s)]
*  All the best. Thank you. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1126.0s)]
*  MUSIC [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1T7HRNCIKFc&t=1130.0s)]
