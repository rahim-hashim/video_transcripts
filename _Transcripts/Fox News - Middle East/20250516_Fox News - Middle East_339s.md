# Trump warns Iran: 'Move quickly or something bad will happen'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU)
*  President Trump continuing his push for peace, confirming there has been progress with Iran [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=0.0s)]
*  over nuclear talks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=7.32s)]
*  Has the U.S. given them a formal proposal? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=10.32s)]
*  Has Steve Witkoff handed that over? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=12.88s)]
*  They have a proposal, but more importantly, they know they have to move quickly or something [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=14.36s)]
*  bad is going to happen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=18.68s)]
*  So here to discuss this, retired four-star general, Fox News' senior strategic analyst, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=21.48s)]
*  of the Institute for the Study of War, General Jack Keene. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=26.04s)]
*  General, first off, on the overall sense of the trip, you really feel like the president [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=29.52s)]
*  accomplished a lot. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=35.64s)]
*  In what way? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=36.76s)]
*  Well, it's obvious, you know, the economic benefit of the trip with the deals that were [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=37.76s)]
*  made, but for me, I mean, when I look at this and what took place and President Trump's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=43.0s)]
*  strength, it's a return of strong American leadership, not only to the region, but the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=49.36s)]
*  whole world is watching it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=52.92s)]
*  This is his first international trip and there's been a flurry of activity since, obviously, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=54.36s)]
*  he took over the presidency after the inauguration. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=59.36s)]
*  But here, this is a seminal event, I think, which sets the stage for President Trump in [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=63.68s)]
*  dealing internationally. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=69.16s)]
*  And he's coming at it from a position of strength and he reverses all the failed policies of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=71.72s)]
*  the Biden administration just simply when you focus on the Middle East, the peas in [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=76.92s)]
*  Iran, never shutting down Iran's proxies. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=81.44s)]
*  We're trying to drive the United States out of the region. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=85.39999999999999s)]
*  Brian, they attacked us over 300 times in those four years in the Biden administration, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=88.08s)]
*  where U.S. troops were in the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=93.16s)]
*  And obviously, Iran operationalized the proxies to Detroit, the state of Israel, with Hamas [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=95.48s)]
*  and Hezbollah, and they never shut down the Houthis, who was firing at U.S. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=101.16s)]
*  ships with ballistic missiles, not to speak of shutting down international trade in the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=107.12s)]
*  Suez Canal and the Red Sea. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  And President Trump has shut all of that down. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=115.24000000000001s)]
*  It underscores the strong American global leadership that exists in the world today. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=118.4s)]
*  And they in the region look at Iran as a threat. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  They don't bring it up, but they know it. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=127.16s)]
*  And when we show weakness with Iran, they get worried. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=128.72s)]
*  By the way, the president sat down with Brett Baer. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  It's going to air tonight. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=134.84s)]
*  They sent over one clip as it relates to Iran. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=136.12s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=138.88000000000002s)]
*  Iran wants to trade with us, OK, if you can believe that. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=139.88000000000002s)]
*  And I'm OK with it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=143.28s)]
*  I'm using trade to settle scores and to make peace. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=144.52s)]
*  But I've told Iran, we make a deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=150.16000000000003s)]
*  You're going to be really, you're going to be very happy. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  But more than anything, I've told Iran very simply, because I heard somebody making my [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=156.64000000000001s)]
*  case last night on television. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  I didn't like it because they were saying there's plenty of time. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=162.79999999999998s)]
*  There's not plenty of time. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=167.84s)]
*  There's not plenty of time. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  You feel urgency. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, they're not going to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=172.44s)]
*  And eventually they'll have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=174.32s)]
*  And then the discussion becomes a much different one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=176.92s)]
*  Your take from that and that evidently we did give them some type of offer. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  And that is got which contains zero enrichment. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=184.92s)]
*  Well, yes, certainly. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=188.36s)]
*  I mean, the president's position is unequivocal. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  You cannot enrich uranium. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  What does that really mean? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  It means you have to dismantle your nuclear enterprise program, which are the centrifuges [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=199.88000000000002s)]
*  that enriches uranium, the facilities at which they do that. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=204.08s)]
*  And those are those major secret sites. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  And then along with that are the ballistic missiles that that deliver them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=210.20000000000002s)]
*  And certainly you cannot allow to have enriched uranium, which qualifies you to have a nuclear [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=216.32000000000002s)]
*  weapon that has to be taken away. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=223.08s)]
*  They have close to 600 tons of it that would have to be gone. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=224.72s)]
*  And Iran has a civil nuclear power plant right now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=229.4s)]
*  One. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=233.24s)]
*  And they get they get the uranium from Russia. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=234.16s)]
*  Interesting enough, all of this enriched uranium they have, they're not using on their civil [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=237.44s)]
*  nuclear power plants, which begs the question, why don't they have five or six? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=242.72s)]
*  If that's what they're really interested in. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=246.84s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=248.56s)]
*  Given they have the capability to build a civil nuclear power plant. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=249.56s)]
*  Of course, they still want a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=252.56s)]
*  You have to have that in the back of your mind going forward. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  And what they the reason why we have to take the enterprise down is because they cheat. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=257.92s)]
*  Of course, they'll do it someplace else, which they have always done. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=262.64s)]
*  They have 12 different sites that they do this stuff at. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  And only some of those sites have anybody ever been there. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=269.76s)]
*  We just found. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=272.92s)]
*  Yeah, we just found another one a couple of weeks ago. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=273.92s)]
*  The other thing that's critical is. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=274.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=276.92s)]
*  Anywhere, any time inspections has got to be critical or the deal will fall apart in [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=277.92s)]
*  execution because they will cheat. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=283.56s)]
*  In other words, we decide where to go and inspect. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=285.92s)]
*  In other words, our inspectors who are appointed to do that, not Iran. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=290.03999999999996s)]
*  Iran has always designated where you can go and when you can go. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=294.36s)]
*  That's got to be off the table. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=298.44s)]
*  Anywhere, any time inspection verify. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=300.03999999999996s)]
*  Right. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=302.84s)]
*  Don't fund the proxies. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=303.84s)]
*  No ballistic missiles. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=304.96s)]
*  They have to. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=305.96s)]
*  That has to be included. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=306.96s)]
*  They've been locked out of Syria and they pretty much isolated as their proxies have [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=307.96s)]
*  taken a real beating outside the Houthis. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  General Jack Keene, so much going on. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=314.32s)]
*  We didn't even touch on Russia with the president's talking about going one on one with Vladimir [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=315.67999999999995s)]
*  Putin. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=319.32s)]
*  Thanks so much, General. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=320.32s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKsefVwt_OU&t=321.32s)]
