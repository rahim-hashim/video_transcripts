# Levin EXPLODES on Biden: He doesn't give a damn
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk)
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and this is Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=0.0s)]
*  I want to talk about casualties. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  Do you think a hundred thousand civilian deaths in one year is significant? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=10.92s)]
*  Oh, it's massive. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=15.56s)]
*  When you consider we lost about 59,000 men and women in the Vietnam War. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  When you consider we lost over 50,000 in the Korean War, it's a lot of people. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=26.04s)]
*  Those were combatants, not civilians, not citizens. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=32.56s)]
*  So let me ask you a question. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=37.28s)]
*  When a president of the United States keeps a border open intentionally, the southern [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=39.519999999999996s)]
*  border, and upwards of a hundred thousand young Americans, aged 18 to 45, die every [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=43.44s)]
*  year that border is open from Fentanyl. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=53.04s)]
*  Almost 100,000 civilian, American civilian casualties. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=57.52s)]
*  Well, what kind of president is that? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=63.56s)]
*  Is that a man who gives a damn about human life? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=66.84s)]
*  Is that a man who's compassionate about the American people? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=69.24000000000001s)]
*  Is that a man who wants to protect the American people? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=72.26s)]
*  Absolutely silent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=76.2s)]
*  He doesn't even talk about it. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=77.4s)]
*  The Secretary of DHS keeps testifying that the border is secure or we need comprehensive [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=80.24000000000001s)]
*  immigration reform. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=84.80000000000001s)]
*  And I'm not even including the inhumanity, the other inhumanity that's taking place [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=86.88000000000001s)]
*  on the border, the sex slaves, the children sold into sex slavery, the rapes, the murders, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  the other drugs coming across, drug cartels with ties to the communist Chinese who use [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=96.84s)]
*  techniques like ISIS coming into our country. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=102.14000000000001s)]
*  They now have a foothold in every major metropolitan area and every one of our states. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=105.52s)]
*  What kind of a president is that? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=110.66s)]
*  Is a president that should be impeached? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=114.52s)]
*  That's a high crime. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=116.52s)]
*  Doing that to your own country? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=118.19999999999999s)]
*  One hundred thousand civilian deaths a year, probably more. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=120.32s)]
*  We just had the FBI director testify that the FBI now controls enough Fentanyl, illegal [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=125.44s)]
*  that it is acquired to kill 270 million Americans. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=131.2s)]
*  270 million Americans and the border is still wide open given what's going on in the Middle [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=136.16s)]
*  East. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=139.76s)]
*  Can you think of another country that has an open border? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=140.76s)]
*  Any? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=143.55999999999997s)]
*  Can you think of another president or prime minister or dictator or monarch who would [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=144.55999999999997s)]
*  leave a border open like that so its own people are suffering and dying? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=148.83999999999997s)]
*  We're talking about potential terrorist attacks. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=152.72s)]
*  We're going to have them. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=155.48s)]
*  We all know it. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=156.48s)]
*  We're going to have millions and millions of people coming in here, not vetting them, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=157.48s)]
*  not even know who they are and where they're going and assume that the people who want [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=160.48s)]
*  to blow us up, the people who took down the towers, the people who hit us over and over [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  and over and over again, that all of a sudden they're going to somehow respect the rules [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=167.88s)]
*  of law or they're not going to sneak across the border. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=172.07999999999998s)]
*  Biden knows it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=175.88s)]
*  Harris knows it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=177.16s)]
*  The attorney general knows it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=178.5s)]
*  The FBI director is sitting right next to Mayorkas and he wouldn't even point the finger [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=180.22s)]
*  and say, you need to secure that border. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=184.26s)]
*  No, he couldn't even bring himself to do that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  Why am I telling you this? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=190.73999999999998s)]
*  Because Joe Biden doesn't give a damn about American civilian casualties as he goes on [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=192.14s)]
*  about civilian casualties in Gaza. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=196.5s)]
*  As he talks about a humanitarian ceasefire. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  You know what a humanitarian ceasefire is? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=202.06s)]
*  It's appeasement. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=204.54s)]
*  It's appeasement in stages. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=205.54s)]
*  But appeasement in stages is appeasement. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=207.45999999999998s)]
*  The Israelis cannot afford to lose a war when their very survival is at stake. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=210.1s)]
*  Ask Hamas. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=214.34s)]
*  They keep announcing we're going to keep at it till they're destroyed. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=215.34s)]
*  Ask Hamas' rioters, protesters. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=218.34s)]
*  The Hamas network, you see them in the streets, you hear the professors, you see the college [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=222.18s)]
*  students, you even see the media. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=225.98s)]
*  What do they say? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=227.7s)]
*  As they spew the propaganda of the enemy. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=229.26s)]
*  As they spew the propaganda of the enemy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=232.2s)]
*  Democrat party is a problem. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=235.45999999999998s)]
*  The Democrat party is a party without a soul. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=237.2s)]
*  It's a party without principle. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=240.02s)]
*  It's a party without morality. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=241.02s)]
*  That's why the Democratic socialists, aka Marxists who hate America, that's why the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=243.66s)]
*  Hamas, Nazi supporting individuals in our country. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  They're all Democrats. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=252.22s)]
*  They have representation in Congress. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=253.22s)]
*  They have representation in Democrat party organizations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=255.78s)]
*  They have representation in the Democrat media. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=258.86s)]
*  They're not Republicans. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=261.12s)]
*  They're not constitutional conservatives. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=263.06s)]
*  They hate us. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=264.78000000000003s)]
*  But I want to talk about civilian casualties. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=267.04s)]
*  Because they're trying to now force Netanyahu to resign. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=271.0s)]
*  MSNBC and Biden and the other, he's weak. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=274.36s)]
*  He's weak. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=278.24s)]
*  No, it's Biden who should resign. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=279.24s)]
*  He should be impeached. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=280.92s)]
*  A high crime that he's committing against the people of the United States, just the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  southern border alone. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=285.70000000000005s)]
*  But I want to give us a little bit of history here that I'm sure is not being taught in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=287.3s)]
*  our schools. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=290.40000000000003s)]
*  The Civil War. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=291.40000000000003s)]
*  The Siege of Vicksburg was one of the most tactically important victories for the Union [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=293.0s)]
*  in the American Civil War, writes Aaron O'Neill at Statistica, as it helped give them control [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=297.0s)]
*  of the Mississippi River, while cutting off a major supply line for Union forces. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=302.12s)]
*  When Major General Ulysses S. Grant's Union troops tried to take the forces by force in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=307.84s)]
*  mid-May 1863, they were twice pushed back with heavy casualties. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=312.64s)]
*  Instead of sending his men to try a third time, Grant had a different idea. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=318.24s)]
*  He encircled Vicksburg, the second most important military manufacturing city in the Confederacy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=322.48s)]
*  One side the Mississippi River, he sent his massive gunboats. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  The rest of it, often on a hill, he surrounded it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=336.56s)]
*  And what did he do? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=340.68s)]
*  Night after night, day after day, relentlessly, he prevented anyone from leaving and he prevented [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=342.16s)]
*  anyone from going in. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=347.66s)]
*  No ingress, no egress. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=349.28000000000003s)]
*  Citizen, non-citizen, it didn't matter. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=351.08s)]
*  The inhabitants survived for about 40 days before running out of provisions. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=353.76s)]
*  They couldn't get any food. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  Many reports claim the starving inhabitants, mostly citizens but also military, had to [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=360.84s)]
*  resort to eating dogs and rats in order to survive. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=366.56s)]
*  Dogs and rats. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  Some people starved to death. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=372.38s)]
*  Most were malnourished. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=374.26s)]
*  It was a horrendous scene. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=375.26s)]
*  Vicksburg. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=377.79999999999995s)]

*  And let me ask this question. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=384.64s)]
*  Israel needs to fight to survive. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=386.68s)]
*  Hamas has said it wants to destroy them. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=388.28s)]
*  Hamas is backed by Iran. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=390.15999999999997s)]
*  Hamas is backed by Hezbollah. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=391.76s)]
*  Hamas is now backed by Russia and China. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=393.6s)]
*  This tiny little Jewish state with seven million Jews up against it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=396.48s)]
*  Do they have a right to fight to win? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=402.76s)]
*  Not if you listen to Joe Biden. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=405.36s)]
*  A humanitarian ceasefire so you can provide food and medicine and fuel that the enemy, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=407.12s)]
*  Hamas, steals? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=414.28000000000003s)]
*  There's evidence. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=415.28000000000003s)]
*  They're stealing fuel from the hospitals. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=416.28000000000003s)]
*  They're using their people as fodder. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=417.28000000000003s)]
*  The Israelis aren't doing it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=420.08000000000004s)]
*  The enemy's doing that. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=421.24s)]
*  But of course, the American media are all in. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=422.24s)]
*  Was it really okay for the Israelis to go after one commander who helped lead the slaughter [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=424.6s)]
*  of their people with all the casualties that occurred? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=430.24s)]
*  Do you think that would have been asked during the Civil War? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  So here's my question. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=434.92s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln, in my view, the second greatest president in American history, George Washington [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=437.44s)]
*  I, did we revere him? [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=442.04s)]
*  You bet we do. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=445.6s)]
*  Why? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=447.08000000000004s)]
*  Because he defeated the South, he kept the Union together, and he ended slavery. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=448.08000000000004s)]
*  Well, let me ask you something. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=451.52000000000004s)]
*  Seven hundred thousand casualties, fifty thousand citizens died. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=455.48s)]
*  Now I know it's not as much as the open border that Biden has with a hundred thousand Americans [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=459.72s)]
*  dying every year, but fifty thousand were killed. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=464.32s)]
*  Was it worth the battle to keep the nation together and to end slavery? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=469.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, most of us think it was. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=473.64s)]
*  You see, Lincoln didn't agree with a two-state solution. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=475.79999999999995s)]
*  It was one country, no two-state solution. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=478.96s)]
*  He could have easily negotiated for a two-state solution. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  He said no, it's the United States of America. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=484.64s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=487.08s)]
*  Number two, slavery. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=488.08s)]
*  Slavery was barbaric. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=489.08s)]
*  Do we agree? [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=490.08s)]
*  Democrat, Republican? [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=491.08s)]
*  All of us agree? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=493.08s)]
*  Yes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=495.08s)]
*  Seven hundred thousand casualties. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=496.08s)]
*  So when the Israelis fight for their lives, for their survival, is that okay? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=498.64s)]
*  No. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=504.03999999999996s)]
*  No, they're the aggressor. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=505.03999999999996s)]
*  No, they're the occupier. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  No, they need to be obliterated. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=508.03999999999996s)]
*  And so they keep trying to pull Netanyahu back. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=510.88s)]
*  They keep trying to pull the IDF back. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=512.92s)]
*  Well, it seems to me, if it was good enough to fight, and it should be, and it was, to [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=514.88s)]
*  end slavery, well, it's good enough for the Israelis to fight for their lives and their [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=520.16s)]
*  very survival and against this whole notion of a two-state solution, which would be their [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=524.12s)]
*  final solution. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=528.88s)]
*  You want to hear another one? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=529.88s)]
*  How about the Battle of Atlanta? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=530.88s)]
*  By 1864, General William Tecumseh Sherman had come to believe that a Union victory required [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  not only defeating the Southern armies, listen, but also destroying the South's physical ability [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=538.64s)]
*  and psychological will to continue the war. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=544.64s)]
*  This was also the case in World War II. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=547.48s)]
*  World War II is often called the war against civilians. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=549.52s)]
*  Dresden, Berlin, London, Nagasaki, Hiroshima, all aimed, partially at military, but all [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=554.0s)]
*  aimed at destroying the will of the people to support these regimes, all of them. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=563.6800000000001s)]
*  And we were involved in them. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=570.0s)]
*  Big time. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=571.6800000000001s)]
*  Atlanta, a transportation industrial center and symbol of Confederate strength, made a [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=573.64s)]
*  prime target. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=577.9599999999999s)]
*  So what did Sherman do? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=580.0s)]
*  Well, he marched through Atlanta like crap through a goose. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=581.4s)]
*  Soldiers set fire to the city, culminating when the troops set much of the downtown area [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=585.76s)]
*  ablaze during the last night in the city. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=590.9599999999999s)]
*  Sherman had carefully studied census records to make sure his troops could live off the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=593.92s)]
*  land before leaving Atlanta and to maintain his supply line. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=597.52s)]
*  The Union soldiers raided farms, destroyed cotton fields and mills, slaughtered livestock, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=602.24s)]
*  burned properties where they met resistance and took as much food as they could carry. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=606.6s)]
*  During the occupation of Atlanta, Sherman wrote to city officials there, war is cruelty [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=611.44s)]
*  and you cannot refine it. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=616.44s)]
*  Years later, he shortened this sentiment during an address at the Michigan Military Academy. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=619.08s)]
*  War is hell. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=623.96s)]
*  And we've always viewed it that way and we've always fought it that way. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=626.1s)]
*  Two of our greatest presidents, Lincoln and then later Grant, viewed it that way. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=629.44s)]
*  We would not have this country. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=634.32s)]
*  We would not have ended slavery if we didn't fight the way we fight. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=636.6400000000001s)]
*  We would not have won World War II and defeated Hitler in the Third Reich, Tojo, the Japanese [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=640.44s)]
*  emperor and Imperial Japan. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=647.2s)]
*  We would not have defeated Mussolini and fascistic Italy. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=650.0600000000001s)]
*  We would not have destroyed those concentration camps and all the rest of the brutality that [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=654.2s)]
*  the Axis powers were involved in had we not fought to win. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=660.76s)]
*  To win. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=665.96s)]
*  That's our perspective. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=668.4s)]
*  That should be our perspective. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=669.52s)]
*  All these calls for the state of Israel, slow down, be careful, don't hit the school, don't [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=670.8s)]
*  hit the hospital. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=678.96s)]
*  Here we have terrorists, desert rats hiding among their people. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  And Israel is the only army on the planet that's supposed to fight a war humanely. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=686.84s)]
*  That's supposed to fight a war and pick out the enemy from the citizen even though they're [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=693.6800000000001s)]
*  wearing the same things and the enemy knows this and is purposely hiding among the citizens. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=698.02s)]
*  Joe Biden says he's very concerned about the Palestinian citizens. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=702.88s)]
*  He's not even concerned about the American citizens. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=708.9200000000001s)]
*  What happened to those Americans in Afghanistan? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=711.2s)]
*  Hundreds of them left behind. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=714.96s)]
*  He doesn't even talk about them. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=716.9200000000001s)]
*  They're there because of him. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=719.5s)]
*  Blinken doesn't even talk about them. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=721.1600000000001s)]
*  Getting the hostages back. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=723.4000000000001s)]
*  I think Biden made it a little more complicated when he handed $6 billion over to the Iranians. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=724.96s)]
*  I don't want to hear that it wasn't our money. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=729.48s)]
*  The South Koreans wouldn't have released it without our say so. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=731.44s)]
*  They held it back with our say so. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=734.2s)]
*  And that money is there for a reason. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=736.2s)]
*  The Iranians already said they'll do whatever the hell they want to do with it. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=738.28s)]
*  And the spigot's still wide open. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=741.4s)]
*  A billion and a half dollars a week going to the Iranian Nazi regime. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=743.28s)]
*  That's funding. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=749.5s)]
*  Funding Hamas. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=750.9599999999999s)]
*  That's funding Hezbollah. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=751.9599999999999s)]
*  That's funding the Houthis. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=752.9599999999999s)]
*  That's funding the attacks on America. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=755.5799999999999s)]
*  Funding the attacks on America. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=758.64s)]
*  And he says he's very concerned about the civilian deaths taking place in Gaza. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=760.64s)]
*  Not Texas. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=766.44s)]
*  Not New York City. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=768.0400000000001s)]
*  No. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=769.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm telling you, ladies and gentlemen, this is the worst president in American history. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=771.0s)]
*  Causing wars. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  He's going to cause a disastrous terrorist attack, one or more in this country. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=776.08s)]
*  He's caused all kinds of harm and I will say death in our own country already. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=780.2600000000001s)]
*  American citizens. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=785.24s)]
*  He left citizens behind in Afghanistan. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=786.48s)]
*  He is a complete and unumidigable disaster. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=789.4000000000001s)]
*  But the Democrat party has a problem. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=791.8800000000001s)]
*  Much bigger than the Republican party. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=795.4s)]
*  The Democrat party, as I've written, it not only hates America, but what is the Democrat [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=797.88s)]
*  party? [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=801.3199999999999s)]
*  The Democrat party is basically an unprincipled organization that seeks power for those who [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=802.3199999999999s)]
*  run it. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=806.92s)]
*  And that's why you can have in the Democrat party overwhelming number of Jewish voters, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=808.28s)]
*  overwhelming number of Muslim voters, overwhelming number of voters who will support and are [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=814.16s)]
*  Hamas versus an overwhelming number of people who support Israel. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=819.8s)]
*  Looking for the same candidates. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=824.96s)]
*  How can that be? [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=827.2800000000001s)]
*  Well, let me ask you. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=828.2800000000001s)]
*  The climate change Marxist fanatics who are destroying, destroying our ability to produce [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=829.2800000000001s)]

*  school offices dictating how they're going to destroy the industrial heartland? [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=855.64s)]
*  How is it that they both vote Democrat? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=860.3399999999999s)]
*  Because they have a corrupt media, a corrupt media, a propagandist media with demagogic [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=863.56s)]
*  hosts. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=870.28s)]
*  The New York Times covered up the Holocaust. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=871.68s)]
*  And now it is the mouthpiece for it. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=875.3s)]
*  It is the propaganda wing of Hamas in the United States. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=877.2s)]

*  White House announces national strategy to combat Islamophobia. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=975.8s)]
*  Now, why have they done this? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=979.0s)]
*  Two quick reasons. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=980.4599999999999s)]
*  One, because part of their base is very upset that Joe Biden gave a speech that he's standing [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=981.4599999999999s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=986.74s)]
*  No, he's not. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=987.86s)]
*  He's doing as little as possible. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=988.86s)]
*  Mark, he's giving them arms. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=990.94s)]
*  Every president has provided them with arms. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=992.78s)]
*  But he's also provided their enemy with $70 billion. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=995.34s)]
*  Let's see. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=998.46s)]
*  $3.4 billion versus $70 billion. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=999.46s)]
*  Seems a little out of whack to me, doesn't it, you, America? [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=1002.46s)]
*  But it's even more than that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=1005.58s)]
*  Their base, as I said. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=1006.74s)]
*  But the Democrat Party has no soul. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-myQwFkLqk&t=1008.78s)]
