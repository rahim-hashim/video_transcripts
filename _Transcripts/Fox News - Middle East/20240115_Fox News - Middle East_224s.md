# 'GENOCIDE JOE': Progressives rip Biden over Israel stance
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg)
*  Joining me now, Mark Thiessen, former chief speechwriter for President George W. Bush, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=0.0s)]
*  American Enterprise Institute senior fellow, Washington Post columnist and Fox News contributor. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=3.64s)]
*  Mark, always good to have you with us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=8.0s)]
*  Good to be with you, Mark. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=9.200000000000001s)]
*  I want to start with this Axios quote about Biden running out of patience with Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  of the, as leader of the Israeli government, says, Biden hasn't spoken to Netanyahu in 20 days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=17.2s)]
*  Since a tense December 23rd call, which a frustrated Biden ended with the words, quote, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=22.92s)]
*  this conversation is over. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=29.12s)]
*  They had spoken almost every other day in the first two months of the war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=31.6s)]
*  So it seems like the detente between these two leaders lasted maybe 60 days of this, but it doesn't sound like it's that cozy now. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=35.160000000000004s)]
*  And it doesn't sound like Netanyahu cares for Biden's advice or cares what his advice is. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=43.04s)]
*  He's going to do what he has to do to protect the state of Israel, because that's what the Israeli people want. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=47.0s)]
*  They are in the post 9-11 period where the country is united left and right behind doing this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=50.8s)]
*  And Biden is under pressure from his own party to rein in Netanyahu and rein back. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=56.28s)]
*  So far, he's resisted it for the most part. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=61.92s)]
*  But you look at those protests outside the White House, that's the Democratic base. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you see those people clanging the gates. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=69.0s)]
*  And imagine what the Democratic National Convention is going to be like. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=71.56s)]
*  They're meeting in Chicago. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=75.08s)]
*  This could be like Chicago 1968 with the anti-Israel, anti-Hamas protests for the entire country to see where the Democratic Party stands on this issue. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=76.44s)]
*  So here's one of those protesters that was back on looking for the date on this. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=85.76s)]
*  This was on the march in Washington on Saturday. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=91.88s)]
*  Oh, this was Saturday. I thought this was further back than that. Let's watch. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=94.4s)]
*  I want to address the occupant in the White House. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=97.64s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden used to cultivate an image of himself as this nice, kind Uncle Joe. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=101.92s)]
*  Now he is no longer the comforter in chief. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=112.28s)]
*  He is known as Genocide Joe. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=116.92s)]
*  So clearly he's got a division within his own party over this issue. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=121.92s)]
*  And I'm thinking about the introduction that I just gave to you as a former speechwriter. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=125.56s)]
*  It feels very much like a time for a presidential speech to articulate the policy of the U.S. government. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=130.04s)]
*  It sounds like he needs to make it clear among the people that work at the White House as well. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=136.28s)]
*  And if they don't agree with it, of course, they're happy. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=139.95999999999998s)]
*  You know, they're welcome to go work somewhere else. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=141.55999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, first of all, I mean, yeah, it's long overdue for a presidential speech. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=144.04s)]
*  But here's the interesting thing for Biden. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=147.67999999999998s)]
*  Normally we're here for the Iowa caucuses, right? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=149.48s)]
*  Normally, what does the sitting president do when the other party's fighting it out in their primaries? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  They retreat into foreign policy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=155.39999999999998s)]
*  They play the role of commander in chief. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  They lead on the world stage. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Foreign policy is the refuge for presidents. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=159.48s)]
*  Foreign policy isn't Joe Biden's refuge. It's his albatross. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=161.48s)]
*  If you look at the RCP average, his handling of foreign policy is underwater by 23 points. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=164.23999999999998s)]
*  And most of that, a lot of that is driven by his own party, by his own base, which just approves of his handling. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=169.04s)]
*  A plurality of Democrats support the Palestinians over Israel. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=174.84s)]
*  Younger voters disproportionately. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=178.64s)]
*  I mean, you just had a poll 67 percent think Jews are an oppressor class and need to be treated as such. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=181.2s)]
*  A majority think that the Hamas attacks were justified by Palestinian grievances. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=185.84s)]
*  He needs younger voters. He needs Arab-American voters. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  He needs he needs he's got a real problem going into this election with his own base because of his foreign policy. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=192.68s)]
*  He's going to have to articulate it in a more clear way to let people know where he stands instead of speaking into kind of a book case or something that he was talking about foreign policy into the other day in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=197.56s)]
*  So we'll see if that happens. Thank you, Mark. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Thanks, Martha. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=211.04000000000002s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MUXHCrqxKQg&t=211.56s)]
