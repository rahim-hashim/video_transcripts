# We are 'fighting for the entire free world': Israeli president
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo)
*  The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip, and we will do a job with it, too. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=5.5s)]
*  other weapons on the site, level the site and get rid of the destroyed buildings, level [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=11.06s)]
*  it out, create an economic development that will supply unlimited numbers of jobs and [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=17.42s)]
*  housing for the people of the area. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=22.98s)]
*  We have an opportunity to do something that could be phenomenal. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=26.52s)]
*  And I don't want to be cute, I don't want to be a wise guy, but the Riviera of the Middle [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=31.52s)]
*  East. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=35.76s)]
*  And that's President Trump this week with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=36.76s)]
*  the first foreign leader to visit the White House in President Trump's second term, with [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=41.6s)]
*  the president's bold idea for the United States to take over the war-torn Gaza Strip and [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=45.56s)]
*  rebuild it, calling its current state uninhabitable. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=51.16s)]
*  Hamas yesterday released three Israeli hostages in exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  the Israeli hostages appearing weak and emaciated when they finally came out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=62.04s)]
*  As talks to begin Phase 2 of the ceasefire and hostage release plan were supposed to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=67.24s)]
*  begin this past week, joining me now in this Sunday Morning Futures exclusive is the president [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  of Israel, Isaac Herzog. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=79.28s)]
*  What can you tell us about the ceasefire? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=82.25999999999999s)]
*  The ceasefire and the hostage release plan with these three additional hostages released [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=84.11999999999999s)]
*  yesterday, sir. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  Just allow me an opening remark to say congratulations to Secretary Excess. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  You know, Israel has worked very closely with the defense establishment in the United States, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=97.88s)]
*  and we wish him and all the Pentagon and all the American military people the best of the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=104.88s)]
*  best as they are our allies and friends. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=110.56s)]
*  As for your question, so yesterday we went through another ordeal, enormous pain and [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=114.0s)]
*  joy. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=120.84s)]
*  Three of our sons came back after being almost a year and three months in captivity, solely [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  in tunnels, in terrible situations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=130.44s)]
*  I'll give you a picture. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=132.88s)]
*  This is Eli Sharabi. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=134.76s)]
*  Eli Sharabi's wife and daughters were murdered and butchered on October 7th. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=136.56s)]
*  Eli Sharabi's brother was murdered and butchered by Hamas in Gaza after being taken hostage [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=143.6s)]
*  from the same kibbutz berry. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=149.4s)]
*  You can see Eli before and Eli after. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  And this is exactly the situation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  They came back emaciated, and what we hear from them are horror stories, which only exemplify [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=156.38s)]
*  why we must do the deal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=163.35999999999999s)]
*  And I want to thank President Trump for being such a strong force in bringing the deal and [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=165.56s)]
*  making it happen, because every person that we bring back, we're saving an entire universe [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=172.68s)]
*  as we believe in Jewish faith. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  And now we have still 76 hostages out there. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=181.12s)]
*  We must bring them back home. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=184.84s)]
*  So Mr. President, the United States broke news this week where the Trump team will be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=186.92000000000002s)]
*  planning to sell seven billion dollars in weapons to Israel. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=192.32s)]
*  Top Democrats are ripping the administration for bypassing Congress. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  The question becomes, will Israel begin these negotiations on phase two terms of the ceasefire [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=201.76s)]
*  this upcoming week? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=208.32s)]
*  These negotiations were supposed to start last Monday. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=210.12s)]
*  So, you know, President Trump had a very important meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=215.52s)]
*  I as president of Israel, I'm not an executive head of state, but of course I'm fully updated [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=220.8s)]
*  and I work closely with all parties concerned. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=227.0s)]
*  It was a very successful, very impressive meeting with excellent results and outputs, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  first and foremost for our ironclad alliance. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  We, Israel and the United States, and you know, United States has the biggest power [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=242.16s)]
*  in the world with Israel, working hand in hand in securing the future on the Middle [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=247.07999999999998s)]
*  East. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=252.0s)]
*  We are fighting for the entire free world. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=253.0s)]
*  We are here in the Middle East as the only democracy in the Middle East. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=256.06s)]
*  We are preventing some of the most dangerous factors and horrors affecting the entire [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  free world because we've seen exactly what happened on October 7th when they butchered [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=266.96s)]
*  and raped and took hostage of so many Israelis. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=272.52s)]
*  And our battle and our bravery and the bravery of our sons and daughters brought change in [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=276.09999999999997s)]
*  the Middle East and that is why when Prime Minister Netanyahu walked into the Oval Office, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=282.08s)]
*  there were real results. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=287.35999999999996s)]
*  Now, a top priority in our national agenda, national psyche, is to bring back our sons [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=288.8s)]
*  and daughters home from captivity, but also making sure that there will be real change [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=294.56s)]
*  in the region, real change in Gaza so that we can offer real hope. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=300.52000000000004s)]
*  So that is, these are the two agenda items we focused on and I sincerely thank President [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=304.76s)]
*  Trump for bringing about this deal and hopefully pushing forward so that we can bring the deal [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=311.64s)]
*  to completion with his envoy, Steve Witkoff. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=317.56s)]
*  So you do expect then to start these phase two talks this week? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=321.16s)]
*  Well, we hope that there is a team that has gone to Qatar or they are the mediators. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=327.16s)]
*  The Israeli cabinet is due to meet in the next few days and I absolutely urge and call [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=334.68s)]
*  for everybody to sit down and speak about the second phase. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=339.76s)]
*  We will have to include the issue of the future of Gaza, but predominantly bring our [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=343.92s)]
*  sons and daughters back home. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=348.24s)]
*  Now, you are also asking about the further agenda and here I must say that we want to [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=349.84000000000003s)]
*  see change and what President Trump has done in his words, in his bold words, is to say [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  to everybody, you know, I am calling your bluff. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  You repeat the same mistake again and again and again. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=367.12s)]
*  You bring, you make a ceasefire and then you enable Hamas to raise its ugly head as a proxy [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  of Iran with all other proxies, simply trying to butcher Israel. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=376.52s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=382.2s)]
*  How about changing the reality in the region? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=383.2s)]
*  You want to give hope to the neighbors of Israel, to the Palestinians and you want the [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=385.12s)]
*  Palestinians to live side by side with Israel. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  Let's try other models and I believe that President Trump ignited a major process that [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=393.47999999999996s)]
*  I hope will bring real change because we must change the reality on the ground. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=399.84s)]
*  So Mr. President, do you support President Trump's idea that the U.S. will take over [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=404.2s)]
*  the Gaza Strip? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=409.28s)]
*  So President Trump made clear later on, also in his words and through his spokespeople, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=412.44s)]
*  that he's not talking about taking over Gaza militarily and of course there's a new timeline. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=419.44s)]
*  President Trump is due to meet with major, major Arab leaders. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=425.8s)]
*  First and foremost, the King of Jordan and the President of Egypt and I think also the [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=430.8s)]
*  Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia as well and so forth and so on. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=436.04s)]
*  And of course, you know, both Jordan and Egypt and the Abraham Accords, partners of ours, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=441.76s)]
*  the accords that were brought about by President Trump in his first administration, they are [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=447.92s)]
*  partners that must be listened to, must be discussed with. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  We have to honor their fears as well and see how we build a plan that is sustainable for [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=456.32000000000005s)]
*  the future. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=462.24s)]
*  But the whole idea of making sure that Gaza changes ownership, that these terrorists, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=463.24s)]
*  these thugs, these barbaric people do not repeat the same old control, that they are [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  creating such huge suffering for their own people. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=475.44s)]
*  There has to be a future for the children of Gaza and the children of Israel and the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=479.12s)]
*  children for the entire region. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=483.2s)]
*  And only under the leadership of President Trump do we see now a new idea come forward. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=486.24s)]
*  And I say to all our neighbors, you have any better idea? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=492.24s)]
*  Please present it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=495.24s)]
*  Well, Mr. President, it sounds like perhaps you could get funding for that idea and the [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=496.24s)]
*  United States would have an ownership from some of the regional partners that you say. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=500.76s)]
*  The conversations President Trump will be having in the coming weeks. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=506.28s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you very much for joining us. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  We so appreciate your time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=512.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much and thank you United States for an incredible friendship with the state [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=513.72s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=518.0s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=519.0s)]
*  Israeli President Herzog, we appreciate it. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5jNDIu3KdOo&t=520.0s)]
