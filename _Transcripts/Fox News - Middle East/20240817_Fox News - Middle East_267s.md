# 'Intense rocket fire': Diplomat warns there's only one way to stop Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E)
*  Michael Orrin with us back again, the former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Ambassador, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=0.0s)]
*  are you surprised, always good to have you by the way, are you surprised that this much [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  time has gone on and we as yet do not see an Iran response? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=8.24s)]
*  Of course, Neil, and it's good to be with you too. No one has an interest on the Palestinian [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  side, on the Hamas side, in reaching a hostage deal right now. I think it's very, very clear. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=20.92s)]
*  Sinwar, the head of Hamas, wants a war between Israel, Hezbollah, and Iran. That war will [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=26.4s)]
*  draw Israeli army out of Gaza. It'll bring down international pressure on Israel that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=32.64s)]
*  will be completely unsustainable for the Jewish state to be isolated in that way. And Israeli [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=38.24s)]
*  cities will be pummeled by rockets by Iran in Hezbollah. And that will enable Sinwar [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  and Hamas to get a better deal. What's the better deal? A permanent ceasefire, a permanent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=49.32s)]
*  ceasefire that enables Hamas to come out of the tunnels, to declare victory, to reconquer [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=53.72s)]
*  Gaza, to mount the next October 7th, because their own leaders say they want to mount 10,000 [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  October 7th to destroy the Jewish state. They want Israel to give up the Philadelphia route [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=64.0s)]
*  between Egypt and Gaza. And that was the route under which all of that massive amounts of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=69.16s)]
*  armaments were smuggled into Gaza before October 7th. That's it. Hamas wins. So they want the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=74.12s)]
*  And what's on the table now in the negotiations is not that. It's not a permanent ceasefire, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=80.92s)]
*  but a temporary ceasefire, where Israel maintains control over that Philadelphia route. So Sinwar [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=85.28s)]
*  is just dragging it out because he knows that this war between Israel, Hezbollah, and Iran [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  is in his interest. There's one way to stop it, Neil, and that is for the United States [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=96.84s)]
*  to stand up to Iran, Iran, which has not paid a single price in this conflict, but with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=101.2s)]
*  Iran, which has been the primary source of all the instability in the Middle East, Iran, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=105.72s)]
*  which is attacking American bases dozens and dozens of times, stopping international shipping [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=111.24s)]
*  in the Mandab Straits, attacking Israel on all borders, including even from Yemen now, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=116.64s)]
*  Iran, which is now... So I take it from what you're saying, and I don't want to put words [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=122.24s)]
*  in your mouth, that even if there is a ceasefire agreement between Hamas and the Israelis, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=129.84s)]
*  because I know Hamas is working through enemy areas, doesn't want to talk directly with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=135.36s)]
*  Israel itself, but let's say they get that. That's no guarantee that Iran still won't [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  want to do something, either on its own or through its various proxies. Hezbollah, Hamas, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=145.08s)]
*  even these Houthi rebels who are always going after shipping in the region. What do you [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=150.02s)]
*  think? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, so far, the head of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, and the Iranian regime have both [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=154.72000000000003s)]
*  said that if Hamas accepts a ceasefire, they'll accept a ceasefire. So going on their word, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=160.24s)]
*  for whatever that word is worth, the answer would be yes. That would interdict an Iranian [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  attack or Hezbollah attack on Israel, at least for the time being. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=170.56s)]
*  By the way, for the people in the northern part of Israel who are under intensive rocket [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=174.28s)]
*  fire, as we're speaking now, I get the notices on my phone. Every rocket fire, we get a red [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=177.64s)]
*  alert. They've been on rocket fire all night long. For those people, they will not come [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=182.32s)]
*  back to their homes easily because the status quo ante of October 6 means that Hezbollah [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=187.95999999999998s)]
*  is right along the northern border, right along the fence. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=192.32s)]
*  You can pick your hole. I don't recommend you do this, but you put your hand to the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  fence, you're going to touch Hezbollah. Now Israelis know what a terrorist organization [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=198.04s)]
*  on the other side of the fence will do to them and to their children and to their wives, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=202.48s)]
*  and they won't come back. So a ceasefire doesn't solve the problem. It merely kicks the problem [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=206.84s)]
*  the can down the road. We're going to have to address that in the long run. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=211.28s)]
*  Hezbollah has to be moved back away from the northern border. The way Hamas was moved away, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=214.6s)]
*  certainly way back from the southern border. But as a stopgap measure, I think a ceasefire [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=219.32s)]
*  would be good. I just don't see where right now Hamas has an interest in achieving one. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=225.16s)]
*  Well, once very closely, Ambassador, good catching up with you, Michael Orrin, the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=231.6s)]
*  former Israeli ambassador to the United States. Benjamin Netanyahu, to make it clear and to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=234.6s)]
*  echo kind of what the ambassador was just saying here, wants no giving way to anything [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=239.16s)]
*  that Hamas is promising, not trusting anything it is promising for the time being, the former [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=245.44s)]
*  prime minister of Israel, Ehud Barak, and what he thinks about that after this. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bd9SUzsFp_E&t=250.88s)]
