# Biden administration allows Iran access to additional $10 billion
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4)
*  The root of all evil here is Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=0.0s)]
*  There is no Hamas without Iran. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=2.92s)]
*  93% of their budget comes from the Iranian Ayatollah. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=4.84s)]
*  Hezbollah is a complete subsidiary of the Iranian Ayatollah. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  So at the end of the day, the hoodies survive on money from the Ayatollah. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=12.36s)]
*  So now we learned Tehran's going to get richer. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=17.34s)]
*  Lindsey Graham sounding the alarm. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Administration greenlights roughly $10 billion for Iran. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=21.0s)]
*  State Department insists it's only for humanitarian aid. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=24.98s)]
*  Sounds familiar, does it not? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=28.24s)]
*  Jillian Turner is following the money from the State Department to explain this. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=30.24s)]
*  Jillian. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=34.04s)]
*  Good morning to you, Bill. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=35.54s)]
*  So the Biden administration is renewing what is called a sanctions waiver. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=36.519999999999996s)]
*  It's going to allow the Iranian regime imminently to access $10 billion in frozen funds that are being held inside Iraq. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=39.72s)]
*  This is a decision that comes as Iranian backed forces are continually attacking U.S. forces inside the Middle East. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=47.34s)]
*  Now, despite I think a total we're looking at 56 strikes now in 29 days, State Department officials insist they are unconcerned about the prospect of that money being used to fund terrorists. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=53.76s)]
*  Listen, we don't worry about optics. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=65.88s)]
*  We worry about reality. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=68.03999999999999s)]
*  And the reality is that these funds, as I said, can only be used for humanitarian and other non-sanctionable purposes. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=69.68s)]
*  This waiver allows Iraq to pay Iran for electricity. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=76.88s)]
*  It's going to go through European and Omani banks. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=80.84s)]
*  Iraq imports as much as 40 percent of its power supply from Iran. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=83.56s)]
*  It was just two months ago the Biden administration released six billion dollars of frozen Iranian funds as part of a prisoner swap deal. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=88.08s)]
*  Now, Republican lawmakers are calling for increased sanctions against Tehran. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=95.24000000000001s)]
*  Listen, there is a whole suite of things we can be doing right now as a country. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=100.24000000000001s)]
*  To weaken Iran and choke them off. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=107.6s)]
*  This is just good old fashioned, hard, reimposition of serious sanctions. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, Ron Zaitola recently bragged that should the regime gain access to billions of dollars and unfrozen funds, they will use it, spend that money. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=117.76s)]
*  However, they see fit, including funding Hamas terrorists. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=125.84s)]
*  Now, the State Department tells us, Bill, by way of defense that they have indeed applied 400 new sanctions against Iran since they've been in office. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=129.24s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=138.04s)]
*  It's a hamster wheel, Jillian, and it's a lot of money. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=138.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=142.32s)]
*  Live at the State Department. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93ghcHKG3d4&t=142.88s)]
