# 'MAJOR SETBACK': This is a 'serious blow' to Hezbollah, says Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ)
*  Alright, you are looking live in Beirut, Lebanon. Smoke's still rising there. That's been the case over almost the last 24 hours since this Israeli strike on a key Hezbollah compound that has taken out Hassan Dezraallah, the head of this group, who had been the head of this group for the better part of 30 years. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=0.0s)]
*  He's dead. A number of his accomplices are. And all of this, as Iran's supreme leader, is telling Lebanese citizens to rise up against Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=16.0s)]
*  We've got General Jack Keane with us. General, what do you make of all of this? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=26.0s)]
*  Well, I think this is really quite remarkable, Neil. I don't have a precedent for it. The Israeli intelligence has thoroughly penetrated the entire leadership structure of the Hezbollah organization. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=31.0s)]
*  And as such, they've been systematically decapitating that leadership structure. I mean, they are severely degraded as an organization because their leaders are gone. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=43.0s)]
*  They still have tens of thousands of fighters and they've got hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles somewhere between 120,000, 150,000. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=54.0s)]
*  So they they still have huge military capability. But this is a major setback for them to have lost that entire leadership structure. It's a serious blow to them and also to the Iranians. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=62.0s)]
*  And we've got to emphasize what the ambassador said here, Neil. I mean, why is Israel doing this? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=76.0s)]
*  They're trying to get Hezbollah to stop shooting into northern Israel so they can return 70,000 citizens to their homes. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=82.0s)]
*  If they don't do that, then Iran and Hezbollah redefine Israel's border. And they're able to do it now because they've about destroyed the five brigades that have been Hamas brigades that have been operating in Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=90.0s)]
*  I mean, they got more work to do, Neil, but the hard work has been done. And that's why these last several weeks you've seen them focusing on Hezbollah. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=104.0s)]
*  Israel does not want to do a ground campaign to force the Hezbollah military forces back. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=112.0s)]
*  They want them to voluntarily take it for take those forces back and stop shooting into northern Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=119.0s)]
*  And that's what this has been all about. That's why they're killing their leaders. And that's what the airstrikes are all about. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=126.0s)]
*  Get them to do this voluntarily. If they don't, Israel is prepared to do it. They've moved five divisions, at least elements of five divisions. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=133.0s)]
*  They mobilize reserve brigades and they're all in northern Israel, ready to do a ground campaign if Hezbollah doesn't pull back. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=141.0s)]
*  That's that's kind of where we are right now. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=150.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, too, what you were saying there, because there have been 100 targets hit in this Beirut concentrated attack separately when it comes to Hamas. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=154.0s)]
*  Twenty three or twenty four terror battalions have been destroyed there. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=165.0s)]
*  There are calculated strikes against Houthi strongholds, another separate proxy for Iran. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=169.0s)]
*  But they've got a lot of work on their hands. And we're told in any and all of these recent operations, at least general, they don't run this by the White House. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=175.0s)]
*  What do you make of that? I don't think they need to. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=183.0s)]
*  I mean, these are operations, highly classified timing and everything is sensitive to do that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=187.0s)]
*  And let's face it, then let's put it right out there. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=193.0s)]
*  The United States, with some exceptions here, has left Israel on its own. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=196.0s)]
*  Far too much. They micromanage their how to run their operations in Gaza. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=201.0s)]
*  They pulled back, giving them the weapons they needed to kind of get their attention, not to not to conduct any campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=207.0s)]
*  I mean, they've been pulling them back. I think the United States should have taken the Houthis off the board a long time ago. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=216.0s)]
*  I mean, think of this. The Houthis have shut down the Suez Canal for months. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=223.0s)]
*  They have fired anti ship ballistic missiles at U.S. Navy warships. And what have we done about that? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=227.0s)]
*  They're still there. Iran's targeting ship is still there. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=234.0s)]
*  And we haven't taken their Navy off the board as a result of it. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=238.0s)]
*  Reagan, when Iran was interfering with the Persian Gulf flow of oil, he took down Iran's Navy to stop that from happening. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=241.0s)]
*  We should have at least helped Israel by taking the Houthis off the board ourselves and certainly within our capability and certainly our justification. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=250.0s)]
*  And let me just say this. People are worried about what Iran is going to do. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=258.0s)]
*  Well, look at I think they've been back on their heels, Neil, ever since. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=262.0s)]
*  And you mentioned it in the introduction, ever since Hania was killed some eight weeks ago. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=265.0s)]
*  They they promised to do something about that hasn't happened. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=271.0s)]
*  I think they may do something here, but they are not going to expand this war and go to war with Israel. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=274.0s)]
*  Why? They lose it and they'll lose their regime. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=281.0s)]
*  There's not they're not that is not going to happen. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=284.0s)]
*  And what's not very well known is the Iranian conventional military is not very strong. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=287.0s)]
*  The strongest part of it is they're rocking the missile force and 40 to 50 percent of those missiles malfunction in the April 13th attack. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=292.0s)]
*  So that's kind of my perspective on, I think, where we are. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=302.0s)]
*  Very telling, General. Thank you very much, my friend. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9crXNqEmcQ&t=306.0s)]
