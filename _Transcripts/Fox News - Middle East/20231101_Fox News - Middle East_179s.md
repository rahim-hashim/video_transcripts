# Ivy League student charged with making online threats against Jews
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA)
*  Well, federal agents have arrested a suspect in the disturbing case of threats [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=0.0s)]
*  made against Cornell University's Jewish community as anti-Semitism surges on [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  college campuses throughout the U.S. We've seen a lot of these stories. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Alexis McAdams is live outside Cornell's Jewish Student Center with more [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=12.72s)]
*  this morning. Good morning, Alexis. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=17.64s)]
*  Brett, good morning. You can see it over my shoulder there. There's a still a [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=21.12s)]
*  police presence in front of one of those buildings that this student who is now [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=23.68s)]
*  a suspect in this case reportedly threatened according to law enforcement. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=27.52s)]
*  So we know that this junior here at Cornell University was arrested here in [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=30.84s)]
*  Ithaca yesterday facing federal charges after police say posted several online [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=34.2s)]
*  threats saying he was going to kill Jewish students on this campus here as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=38.6s)]
*  the police have been on alert here. We've been talking with Jewish students [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  here. Brett who tell us they're happy someone's in custody and hope to send a [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=46.18s)]
*  strong message. Listen, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=49.2s)]
*  since they caught them so quick, I think people will not be emboldened and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=51.32s)]
*  will not do something like this in the future. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=56.08s)]
*  Cornell University in Ithaca has been on high alert since investigators say [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=61.120000000000005s)]
*  Patrick Dye, a junior at the school, reportedly posted online threats to [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=64.72s)]
*  shoot up the kosher dining hall. That was just one of them. Brett [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=68.88s)]
*  investigators say he also wrote that he would slit the throats of Jewish [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=71.84s)]
*  students on Cornell's campus. So the FBI and the state police stepped in [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=75.16s)]
*  immediately. They use Dye's IP address to track him down, matching it to nearly [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=78.96000000000001s)]
*  a dozen posts. So one student told me that the Jewish students are still [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  concerned and worried for their long term safety. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=87.04s)]
*  They wanted new security measures on their windows. Um, you know, we're [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  installing here new security systems and locks on our doors to help protect our [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=95.60000000000001s)]
*  building. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=100.2s)]
*  It's not just Cornell dealing with the rise in anti Semitic threats since the [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=102.92s)]
*  Hamas attacks on Israel on October 7th, anti Semitic incidents in the United [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=106.44s)]
*  States have increased nearly 400% according to the Anti Defamation League, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  the American Jewish Committee telling Fox News schools can't try to appease [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=116.12s)]
*  everyone here. They have to condemn these acts. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  It's not a matter of, you know, if there's gonna be a future attack against [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=123.08000000000001s)]
*  Jewish students on a campus, it is a matter of one. And until they really [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=127.76s)]
*  step up and change their rhetoric and change their response, uh, Jewish [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=132.24s)]
*  students aren't gonna feel safe on campus. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=137.68s)]
*  And bread, just finding out moments ago that Patrick Die will be in a federal [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=141.48s)]
*  courthouse here in New York around 2 30 this afternoon. So we'll keep you posted [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=144.64s)]
*  on all the charges that will then be talked about inside of that courtroom. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=148.12s)]
*  He could face up to five years behind bars here for these threats. His dad [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  talked to the New York Post last night saying that his son suffers from [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=155.23999999999998s)]
*  depression and said that he had to take some breaks from school. So they're [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=158.0s)]
*  talking about his mental fitness as well. At this point, Brett, Alexis McAdams [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqom-IHY9QA&t=161.95999999999998s)]
