# IDF spokesman addresses precision strikes against Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8)
*  Now let's go to Victoria Coats. She's the Heritage Foundation National Security Vice President and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=0.0s)]
*  former Deputy National Security Advisor. Victoria, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=4.8s)]
*  We're seeing this play out in real time. It was anticipated that Israel was going to retaliate [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=10.48s)]
*  and respond to Iran. But based on what we're seeing here in real time, there's lots more to learn. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=15.84s)]
*  What's your reaction to what's happening? Well, good to be with you, Jason. And yeah, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=22.72s)]
*  this came as something of a surprise to a lot of us because Israel had, I think, quite masterfully [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=28.64s)]
*  signaled that after the U.S. intelligence leak over the weekend, they were going to need more [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=34.64s)]
*  time to prepare. A lot of folks were hearing November 1st as a potential strike time. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=39.2s)]
*  But to go ahead and hit Iran tonight shows them that they have to be ready 24-7. I think this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=44.08s)]
*  will be a more forceful strike than the one, as Trey just reported, that followed the April 13th, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=50.88s)]
*  14th Iranian attack on Israel. They could strike potentially military targets. But the question is, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=56.64s)]
*  is if they hit anything that's sensitive in terms of their nuclear program. And they've said very [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=65.6s)]
*  clearly they're not going to strike the oil installations. That apparently is at the direct [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=71.84s)]
*  request of the Biden administration that doesn't want a crisis in international energy markets. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=76.4s)]
*  But we're going to have to wait and see just what they did hit and how badly they've disabled [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=83.36s)]
*  Iranian infrastructure. Yeah, we're being told that the White House has called a lid for the night, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=88.4s)]
*  meaning that the White House is not anticipated to issue any other statements at this point. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=95.12s)]
*  It is in the middle of the night. It's nearly 3.30 in the morning there in Tehran. The precision, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=102.16s)]
*  I think, of what the Israelis are doing here, they're certainly going to great lengths to say, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=109.12s)]
*  hey, this is a retaliatory. We're trying to degrade your opportunity to hit back at us, [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  but we're not trying to escalate it. Is that the right messaging? Do you think that's permeating? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=121.04s)]
*  What effect does that have on the psychology of war? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=127.12s)]
*  That, of course, is the desired effect. Trey used the word deterrence repeatedly. That's [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=133.28s)]
*  what the Israelis want, and that's what any American wants. We want the Iranians to stop this, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=138.16s)]
*  to stop the seven-front war, to stop all of these attacks from all around Israel that are also [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=143.52s)]
*  attacks on America. They don't ask for anyone's passport when they attack young people at a music [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=149.44s)]
*  festival on October 7th. They just want to kill. And when Americans fall afoul of that, that's just [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=155.6s)]
*  fine with them. So what we need is the Iranians to get back in their box and stop this and not [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=161.92s)]
*  feel emboldened that they can direct 180 ballistic missiles at Israel. And the other problem with [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=167.28s)]
*  those missiles coming at Israel, Jason, is that the missiles themselves cost between maybe $500,000 [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=173.76s)]
*  and $700,000. The interceptors range from $2 million to $12 million, depending on the system, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=182.8s)]
*  the THAAD, which we were just discussing, being the most expensive of all. So the Iranians, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=190.08s)]
*  when they do that, score a monetary victory over us. We need them to stop it. We need to [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=196.48s)]
*  harbor those resources. And hopefully what Israel did tonight achieved that. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=201.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's no indication, based on the reporting that we've heard so far, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  that the Iranians have responded in kind, that they are firing upon Israel [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=211.44s)]
*  in response to this attack that's happening. But again, that may be premature. This is playing out [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=219.12s)]
*  in real time. We're just hearing and seeing the reports based on what's happening. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=224.64s)]
*  We do also have this IDF statement that came out that was very strong, I thought, and very much on [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=229.67999999999998s)]
*  point. You heard what the IDF said. What's your reaction to what their statement was? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=235.92s)]
*  Oh, no, they're 100% correct. This is entirely within Israel's purview to do this. Iran needs [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=242.0s)]
*  to be on notice that their actions will have retaliation and that this is not, I mean, it is [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=247.76s)]
*  indeed about the October 1st ballistic missile attack, but it's about all the other attacks [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=253.92s)]
*  that are taking place on Israel. Victoria? Victoria? Yes, sir? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=258.8s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt you, Victoria. We actually have the sound of the IDF spokesperson. Let's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=262.0s)]
*  play that and then get your reaction to it. The response to months of continuous attacks from [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=267.76s)]
*  the regime in Iran against the state of Israel. Right now, the Israel Defense Forces is conducting [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=273.28s)]
*  precise strikes on military targets in Iran. The regime in Iran and its proxies in the region [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=280.88s)]
*  have been relentlessly attacking Israel since October 7th on seven fronts, including— [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=288.96s)]
*  Victoria, we've got a lot of guests. We're going to try to get in here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6U3oyUqtBT8&t=297.76s)]
