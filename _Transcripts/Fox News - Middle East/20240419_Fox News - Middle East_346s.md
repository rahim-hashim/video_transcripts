# Retired general warns of attacks in US after Israel's counterattack on Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU)
*  Bring in Brigadier General Rob Spalding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=0.0s)]
*  He joins us right now. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=2.36s)]
*  General, good morning to you. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  Morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=5.88s)]
*  So what do you make of the fact that so far Israel [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=6.48s)]
*  has said nothing, Iran has said we're not going to strike back. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=9.36s)]
*  And it sounds, as I mentioned a moment ago, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=14.24s)]
*  the only people who have confirmed that it was Israel [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=16.56s)]
*  is the US Pentagon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=19.56s)]
*  And Jackie Heinrich reported last night [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=21.28s)]
*  that apparently the United States was in contact. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=23.12s)]
*  Israel called us last night and said, hey, we're going to hit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=25.96s)]
*  But that's the only notification. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=30.12s)]
*  Well, the Israelis are typically silent about what they do [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=34.92s)]
*  in operations such as these. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=38.8s)]
*  We talk all the time. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  So it's in character for what goes on typically [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=42.04s)]
*  for one of these strikes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=45.96s)]
*  General, Iran is downplaying it. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  And we've had reporters, Trey Yank says [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=50.92s)]
*  he thinks this gives them an exit ramp [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  so they can save face, don't have to necessarily respond. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  But you had the foreign minister of Iran [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=58.0s)]
*  on one of the channels here in New York just hours [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=61.72s)]
*  before this strike. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=65.56s)]
*  And he said, if Israel commits that mistake once again, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=67.0s)]
*  our response will be decisive, definite, and regretful. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=70.84s)]
*  How do you think they'll respond if they respond at all? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=74.76s)]
*  Well, as I watched that, his statement, what [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=78.52s)]
*  was concerning to me was it sounded like it wasn't just [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=83.32s)]
*  aimed at Israel. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=86.8s)]
*  It was also aimed at the United States. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  And given our southern border situation, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=89.88s)]
*  and in particular, their ability to potentially create [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=92.52s)]
*  a nuclear weapon, I'd be worried about attacks [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=95.8s)]
*  here in the homeland. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=97.88s)]
*  You had video of Hamas here in the United States. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=99.04s)]
*  So I think it's a concern. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=103.08s)]
*  You know, General, I'm just curious [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  about our foreign policy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=105.88s)]
*  So we say, Israel, you can't get involved with this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=107.64s)]
*  You can't respond. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=110.16s)]
*  We know Iran is the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=111.6s)]
*  Then we know Israel is our ally. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  What is the position? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  Do you have a grasp of what the administration is saying? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=117.52s)]
*  Can we just push our arms back and say, Israel, you do it. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=121.2s)]
*  We're not going to get involved? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=124.92s)]
*  There's no comprehensive strategy. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=128.12s)]
*  We typically respond to other provocations. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=130.08s)]
*  You know, I would like to say that everything [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=134.0s)]
*  was coordinated, because these are all related. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=136.28s)]
*  Iran is supported by China. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=140.24s)]
*  China supports Russia. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=142.52s)]
*  So this is a comprehensive global war that we're facing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=143.84s)]
*  It's a Cold War, and it seems like it's about to turn hot. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=147.48000000000002s)]
*  General, the thing is, if you take a step back [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=151.32000000000002s)]
*  and you do talk about strategy, the world [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=153.52s)]
*  was set to watch the Abraham Accords expand, Saudi Arabia [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=156.08s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=159.44s)]
*  And what happens October 7th? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=160.28s)]
*  All hell breaks loose as Hamas rises up [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  after meeting with Iranian and Hezbollah officials [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=165.28s)]
*  multiple times going to the Wall Street Journal, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=168.12s)]
*  and they execute the most horrific possible attack [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=170.23999999999998s)]
*  on Israel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=173.92s)]
*  Since that time, nothing but tumult. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=174.88s)]
*  But if you take a step back, how do you [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=177.64s)]
*  get control of this situation and recognize [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=180.39999999999998s)]
*  that Iran's the problem, and then go work with your neighbors [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=184.32s)]
*  to come up with a solution? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  Because winning in Gaza, winning over in Lebanon, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=190.0s)]
*  striking Iran is exactly what Iran wants. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=194.6s)]
*  The Abraham Accords really started [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=200.6s)]
*  to bring the Gulf states and Israel together, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=202.44s)]
*  and I think those should be repursued. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=204.27999999999997s)]
*  I think we should start to put sanctions on Iran and China, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  put the Houthis back on the terror watch list. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Basically, a comprehensive strategy [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=211.64s)]
*  to bring the Middle East more in line with the Arab countries [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  and Israel, and basically isolate Iran. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=218.64s)]
*  Our funding of Iran is really the problem. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  General, apparently, according to The New York Times, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=226.44s)]
*  last weekend, senior officials in Israel [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=228.72s)]
*  were ready to, pretty much in real time, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=231.72s)]
*  OK, they're bombing us, let's bomb them. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=233.88s)]
*  But we're talked out of it by Joe Biden. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=236.08s)]
*  Clearly, the advice that Bibi Netanyahu has been getting [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=238.28s)]
*  is don't make this a bigger war. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=242.8s)]
*  We knew that the Israelis were going to have to strike back, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  and they did, even though they're not [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=248.4s)]
*  taking credit for it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=250.12s)]
*  And now we know that Iran says, you know what, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=251.32s)]
*  we're not going to retaliate. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=254.44s)]
*  So is it over? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=256.04s)]
*  Well, I mean, really, this began all the way back to 2020 [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=260.24s)]
*  with the Biden administration basically reopening [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=264.20000000000005s)]
*  our friendship with Iran. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=267.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's the problem. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  It happened on October 7th, yes, but that has been building [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=271.6s)]
*  because we've been funding them and slowly relaxing [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=275.48s)]
*  all the pressure that we had put on them [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=278.56s)]
*  in the prior administration. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  And we're afraid to sanction oil because it'll [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=282.44s)]
*  bring the price of oil up. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  And the foreign ministers over here [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=285.96s)]
*  are basically running, brushing us back, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=287.4s)]
*  telling us we better not act. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=290.71999999999997s)]
*  General, is it too late to pivot for this administration? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=292.56s)]
*  Because I know this is supposed to be a part of his legacy, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=296.32s)]
*  part two of the Obama administration [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=298.84s)]
*  with a new nuclear agreement. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=300.91999999999996s)]
*  Can the administration say we're done with this? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=302.76s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  You know, I think this entire system is a line towards Iran. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=307.35999999999996s)]
*  They're very pro-Palestinian. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=312.96s)]
*  I'm not sure why they are, but they are. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=315.48s)]
*  You know, we're seeing rising anti-Semitism. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=317.88s)]
*  It's just part of the ideology. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=320.52000000000004s)]
*  And, you know, I think we're going to be in for it [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=323.04s)]
*  until the end of this administration. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=324.92s)]
*  Yeah, the next generation of Democrats [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  certainly are pro-Palestinian. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=328.36s)]
*  We're seeing that on college campuses across the country. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=330.12s)]
*  General, thank you. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=332.92s)]
*  General, thank you. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWNmm_KI4pU&t=333.64000000000004s)]
