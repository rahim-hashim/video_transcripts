# Iranian proxies vow to target ships heading to Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo)
*  All right, yeah, now from football to war, U.S. forces in the Mideast, on alert, has [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=0.0s)]
*  two more U.S. bases in Syria, are attacked by Iranian-backed militias. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=5.58s)]
*  That is 87 attacks since October 17th with Iranian proxies to blame. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=10.02s)]
*  Take a look at this map. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=14.3s)]
*  87 separate attacks. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=15.5s)]
*  We've answered five times. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=17.06s)]
*  What are we so worried about? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=18.96s)]
*  Why are we so concerned? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=20.3s)]
*  Why are we letting militias hit our people? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=21.3s)]
*  Can you imagine if you're the parent of somebody stuck on one of these bases, 2,500, with some [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=23.54s)]
*  of the 900 that are in Syria right now trying to protect our forces and some of our groups [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=29.06s)]
*  and of course the oil in the region. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=35.14s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about fighting the war on terror, GOP congressman, retired Navy [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=37.379999999999995s)]
*  Seal Commander himself, Congressman Ryan Zinke. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=41.04s)]
*  Hey, great to be here. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=42.98s)]
*  Congressman, great to see you. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=43.98s)]
*  When you see these hits on our people, what goes through your mind? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=44.98s)]
*  This right here. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=48.46s)]
*  This is where they're coming from. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=49.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  And they know it, and they know that we know it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=52.099999999999994s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=53.54s)]
*  So you have proxies. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=54.54s)]
*  You have the Hesbala. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=56.54s)]
*  You have Hamas. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=57.54s)]
*  All of them stems from here. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=58.82s)]
*  So what we're seeing is really a trifecta of evil. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=60.74s)]
*  You have Russia assaulting Ukraine. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=63.7s)]
*  You have now Iran backing forces against Israel. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=66.9s)]
*  And then you have China, you know, also is hanging out there with Taiwan. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=71.14s)]
*  And it should be noted that you have joint operations, joint military operations off [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=74.98s)]
*  the coast with who? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=78.9s)]
*  China, Russia, and Iran. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=80.38s)]
*  We've been in these regions. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=82.74s)]
*  The New York Times writes a big story this weekend. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=83.74s)]
*  We know South of Baghdad is where these militias convene. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=85.86s)]
*  They train and they build weapons. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=88.86s)]
*  They're building drones. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=91.5s)]
*  Where do you think, especially, they say South of Baghdad, where do you think it is? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=92.61999999999999s)]
*  Well, remember the time the technology is all coming from Iran, right? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=95.61999999999999s)]
*  It's assembly and then probably in this area. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=98.58s)]
*  You know, remember Iraq has a lot of Shia and Shia are Iranian. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=101.5s)]
*  So you look at it in background and history and culture, and that's what's driving that [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=106.3s)]
*  effort. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=111.5s)]
*  I'm not worried about escalating this situation, but how is it escalating returning an attack [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=113.26s)]
*  on your troops? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=117.58s)]
*  How is it escalating protecting them besides knocking these rockets out of the sky? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=118.78s)]
*  So let's take a look at another threat, and that is the Houthi rebels. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=122.34s)]
*  Located here, they just said, if you come down the Red Sea, we're going to start hitting [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=127.18s)]
*  you, especially if you're heading over to Israel. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=132.3s)]
*  So no commercial shipping is safe. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=134.38s)]
*  Tell me where the oil is coming from. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=137.38s)]
*  Tell me where it worries you most. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=138.86s)]
*  Well, yeah, the Suez Canal. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=140.22000000000003s)]
*  And obviously in here, in the Red Sea, going out to Asia and going into Europe, much of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=141.62s)]
*  the world's petroleum passes through there. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=149.10000000000002s)]
*  And again, Yemen is supported by who? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=151.42000000000002s)]
*  Once again, that's the target, is that it's a Houthi and primarily supported by Iran, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=154.46s)]
*  which they view them as a brother. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=160.66000000000003s)]
*  These are raw guys from the, these aren't sophisticated fighters. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=163.94000000000003s)]
*  They don't have the ability to purchase sophisticated weapons. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=168.34s)]
*  It's coming right from them, and they're shelling us as we come through. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=172.14000000000001s)]
*  So now we have to spend more money to escort ships, commercial ships, through this region. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=176.44s)]
*  Where's our fleet? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=181.98000000000002s)]
*  Well, some of our fleets are here in position if the Hezbollah of north would attack. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=182.98000000000002s)]
*  But remember the Houthis, you know, what's their mantra? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=189.06s)]
*  It's a death to America, death to Israel, great to God, and victory to Islam. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=191.82s)]
*  And annihilation of the Jewish people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=198.3s)]
*  That's the motto of the Houthis. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=200.58s)]
*  Remember, they were lobbing missiles into Saudi Arabia, and Saudi Arabia said, hey America, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=203.22s)]
*  how long do we have to take this? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=208.70000000000002s)]
*  Can you lend me some planes and some missile defense? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=210.18s)]
*  And we did. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  And then they started bombing into Yemen, and they had world consternation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=213.42000000000002s)]
*  So wait a second, they were supposed to just take the rockets, really from Iran, give it [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=217.3s)]
*  to Yemen, and then tossed at them. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=222.18s)]
*  And when they answered back, they had world condemnation. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=224.54s)]
*  Now they're saying, look, these guys who were hitting us are now hitting you. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=227.01999999999998s)]
*  And they're looking at us saying, now you deal with it. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=231.56s)]
*  Well, in many cases, you know, action that they're not responding to is an incentive. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=234.06s)]
*  When we get hit, we should hit harder twice. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=240.54s)]
*  And that's always been the strength of America to take action and make sure that we have [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=242.95999999999998s)]
*  peace in that area. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=249.22s)]
*  But when we don't take action, we let missile after missile, ship after ship, then our allies [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=250.58s)]
*  sense that we're not going to be with them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=256.14s)]
*  That's core to it is our allies sense that, you know, in a fight, we're not going to be [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  with them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=263.02000000000004s)]
*  We have the firepower, we got the training, we got the people, we got to make the choice, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=264.02000000000004s)]
*  and that comes from the White House. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=267.54s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=269.06s)]
*  Congressman Ryan Zinke, thanks so much. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=270.06s)]
*  Oh, it was a pleasure. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=271.06s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=272.06s)]
*  All right, in a suit, still doing the military thing. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=273.06s)]
*  We should just put you in camouflage again. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=274.94s)]
*  Be well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=276.90000000000003s)]
*  I thought it's a lot easier being in military right now than in Congress. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=277.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=280.97999999999996s)]
*  It seems like it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FI26iv97bDo&t=281.97999999999996s)]
