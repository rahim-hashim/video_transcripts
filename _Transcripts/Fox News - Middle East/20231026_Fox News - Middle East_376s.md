# Israeli military launches 'largest incursion' into Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0)
*  A Fox News alert. Overnight, Israeli troops launching what's being called the largest [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=0.0s)]
*  ground raid into northern Gaza since the war began. And moments ago, the IDF confirmed [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=4.76s)]
*  it eliminated five Hezbollah cells that tried to launch rockets at Israel. Officials also [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=10.28s)]
*  confirming there are at least 224 hostages being held by Hamas in Gaza, but that number [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=15.44s)]
*  could rise. The brief incursion comes hours after The Wall Street Journal reported that [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=21.8s)]
*  Israel agreed to delay a full ground invasion until the Pentagon can deploy air defense [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=26.6s)]
*  systems to protect American troops in the region. Those systems are expected to be in [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=32.0s)]
*  place later this week. Let's bring in former assistant secretary of state for George W. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=36.6s)]
*  Bush, Robert Charles. Robert, great to have you here. What's your takeaway from this breaking [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=41.24s)]
*  news overnight? Was this a way to soften targets in anticipation of a ground invasion? Was [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=45.8s)]
*  this a trial run for a ground invasion or some combination of both? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=51.08s)]
*  Well, you know, the way a war should be fought, Todd, in every situation is surprise is an [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=55.08s)]
*  advantage. And so I'm not even going to make a guess. I'm just going to say that Israel [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  is doing what Israel has to do. My hope is that they can avoid as much collateral damage [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=68.16s)]
*  as possible in Gaza and anywhere else that it ends up spreading. And also that escalation [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=73.44s)]
*  can be kept in mind. We don't want this to escalate. This is essentially a proxy war [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=79.0s)]
*  with Iran. And I think everybody who knows anything about the region and I've been in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=84.0s)]
*  almost all the countries of the region over the years knows that this is a proxy war with [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=89.64s)]
*  Iran where Hezbollah, Hamas, Palestinian, Islamic Jihad, Fatah and others are really [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=94.16s)]
*  doing Iran's bidding and are underwritten by Iran. So my hope is that this just stays, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=99.76s)]
*  gets done quickly without collateral damage as much as possible and ultimately doesn't [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=105.64s)]
*  escalate. A lot of smoke right now in the live visuals [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=110.28s)]
*  that we are showing from Gaza. Got to get your thoughts on this, sir. You live 30 minutes [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=113.2s)]
*  from where this shooting happened, series of shootings in Lewiston, Maine. How did you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=117.8s)]
*  learn what happened and what did you do in response? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=122.84s)]
*  Actually a friend called me. I otherwise wouldn't have known anything about it. Although I passed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  that place where those things occurred probably twice a week, twice or three times a week. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=131.82s)]
*  And, you know, I think people just have to keep in mind that on the one hand, it sounds [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=137.54s)]
*  like another event in a place which is just another place. But the odd thing about this [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=143.38s)]
*  is that these people, we people around here, yes, shock and grief. And I can't even begin [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=149.29999999999998s)]
*  to think about the heartache. But it's also the fact that people around here trust each [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=156.78s)]
*  other, Todd. We do good for each other all the time. This is a small place. The entire [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=162.46s)]
*  state only has about a million people. So we're a very small, wooded place. I'm probably [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=168.46s)]
*  20 minutes from where it happened. And so what did I do? I think there's about 100, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=174.02s)]
*  I'm in Androscoggin County. There are about 100,000 members of Maine who are in Androscoggin, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=179.22000000000003s)]
*  citizens of Maine in Androscoggin County. And I did what most of them probably did. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=185.22s)]
*  I racked up my 9 millimeter and I put it beside me. And if anything comes through my front [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=189.98s)]
*  door, I'll be ready for it. But you have to understand everybody around here is familiar [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=195.42s)]
*  with firearms. I would bet you that two-thirds of the county did exactly what I did, which [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=199.5s)]
*  is just to say it's unsettling. It's really terrible for the families afflicted. It will [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=204.94s)]
*  break the trust for a long time. It's a wound that will heal, but it will leave a scar because [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=212.02s)]
*  we're not used to anything like this around here. Nothing like this. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=218.34s)]
*  We just got word that the shelter in place has been extended to Lisbon, that of course [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=221.46s)]
*  the location where the white Subaru was found. But knowing this area as well as you do, Robert, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=226.18s)]
*  this is a wooded area. I understand that the General Lewiston area is somewhat of an urban [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=233.28s)]
*  area, but the surrounding environment, I mean this is Maine woods. How tough is it [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=238.94s)]
*  going to be to catch this guy, especially if he has tactical training from his time [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=242.98s)]
*  in the military? Yeah, I don't know what his training is other [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=246.62s)]
*  than what I've read in the papers. But between me and where that event occurred is mostly [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=250.54s)]
*  woods. We're a pretty undense area. And so there's a lot of people like me, I'm sure, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=256.54s)]
*  that are just doing what I'm doing, which is just being prepared in case. And there [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=263.14s)]
*  are tools, law enforcement, I've worked with law enforcement for a long time myself, there [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  are tools that you can use and I won't get into them in any depth, but to say that gradually [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  they will put a ring around this place and they will shrink it down until they find him. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=278.22s)]
*  And I do want to say I cannot say enough good for law enforcement. Law enforcement is out [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=284.62s)]
*  there for you and for me and for all of my neighbors today, going out there and taking [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=291.22s)]
*  a big risk in order to get this guy down and to bring him down and to prevent any further [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=296.46s)]
*  harm from happening in this community. So I love law enforcement. I always have. And [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=301.53999999999996s)]
*  I think Americans ought to take two or three lessons out of this. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=306.29999999999995s)]
*  One is the Second Amendment has value and frankly, everybody in this region has a gun [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=310.29999999999995s)]
*  and they're going to be using it if they need to to protect themselves and their families. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=316.65999999999997s)]
*  Second law enforcement is our friend every day of the week. They do their level best, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=320.74s)]
*  99% of them every day of the week and they go into dangerous way for us. And this is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=325.26s)]
*  a classic example, even as we mourn and grieve for these families and I hope and pray that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=329.14s)]
*  the people who are wounded get through it. But we are blessed to have law enforcement [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=336.90000000000003s)]
*  officers who care as much as they do around here. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=343.90000000000003s)]
*  Agreed. Before we let you go, you going to sleep tonight? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=348.1s)]
*  No, I haven't been asleep at all. I have my sidearm right here and I'll do what I have [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=352.1s)]
*  to do to be ready. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=356.22s)]
*  It seems like that is going to be a common refrain from you and your neighbors throughout [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=357.22s)]
*  this area. I just got a text from somebody that I'm very close with up in Maine and he [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=361.14000000000004s)]
*  said the entire area is grieving and evil has come to that community. They don't expect [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=364.90000000000003s)]
*  this up there. You don't expect this up there. So it's a tough morning for everybody. Robert, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=370.46000000000004s)]
*  appreciate it. Stay safe, sir. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1CUyrGn4H0&t=374.06s)]
