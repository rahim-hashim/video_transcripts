# Pentagon briefing on Chinese spy balloon
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8)
*  All right, well, good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=0.0s)]
*  Just a few things at the top, and then we'll get right to your questions. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=5.44s)]
*  So first, as you can see, we are conducting press briefings here in our temporary press [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=9.72s)]
*  briefing room while our primary location undergoes extensive technical renovations and upgrades. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=14.92s)]
*  We do greatly appreciate your patience and flexibility as we work to install some long [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=21.36s)]
*  break. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=26.56s)]
*  We do not have internet or phone capability in this area of the Pentagon for a variety [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  of reasons. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=31.2s)]
*  Our normal call in options will not be available. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=32.2s)]
*  So for those who have had to call in, we apologize for the inconvenience. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=35.2s)]
*  However, we will aim to get our briefing transcripts and the audio up as quickly as possible for [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=39.64s)]
*  reporting purposes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=44.68s)]
*  We'll also aim to answer your questions through our D.O.D. press desk when you send them to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=45.68s)]
*  us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=51.24s)]
*  Moving forward, we'll look at ways to improve our reporting and our reporting. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=52.24s)]
*  And expect that our regular press briefings will resume back in the press briefing room [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  in middle to late May. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=60.52s)]
*  So again, we appreciate your patience and flexibility and extend our thanks to the Department [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=63.04s)]
*  of the Air Force for allowing us to use Airman's Hall as our temporary briefing home. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=67.68s)]
*  In other news, Secretary Austin returned yesterday from a very productive series of meetings [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=72.76s)]
*  in the Republic of Korea and the Philippines. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=77.72s)]
*  The secretary and his colleagues have been very supportive of the meeting. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=80.4s)]
*  The secretary and his Korean counterpart, Minister Lee Jong-Sup, jointly reaffirmed [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=84.32s)]
*  measures to enhance extended deterrence on the Korean Peninsula. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=89.16s)]
*  The two leaders additionally pledged to closely cooperate regarding U.S. strategic assets [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=93.36s)]
*  in the future, as well as further expand and bolster the level and scale of combined exercises [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  and training. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=105.16s)]
*  And the Philippines Secretary Austin had his first in-person meeting with his counterpart, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  Secretary Galvez, and reiterated that the U.S. commitment to Philippine security is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=112.64s)]
*  ironclad. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  The secretary expressed his appreciation for the Philippines' approval of four new [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=118.52s)]
*  Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement locations, and both Secretary Austin and Secretary Galvez [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=123.11999999999999s)]
*  noted that the EDCA is a key pillar of alliance cooperation and supports combined training, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=128.72s)]
*  exercises and interoperability. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=135.48s)]
*  Separately, the Department of Defense announced today a significant new package of security [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=137.28s)]
*  assistance for Ukraine. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=142.08s)]
*  This includes the authorization of a presidential drawdown of security assistance valued at [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=144.08s)]
*  up to $425 million, as well as $1.75 billion in Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=148.96s)]
*  funds. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=156.84s)]
*  The presidential drawdown is the 31st such drawdown of equipment from DoD inventories [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=158.06s)]
*  for Ukraine. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=162.84s)]
*  In total, the U.S. has now committed $32 billion in security assistance to Ukraine since 2014 [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=164.44s)]
*  and $29.3 billion since Russia's unprovoked and illegal invasion nearly one year ago this [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=171.32s)]
*  month. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=177.68s)]
*  Today's announcement includes critical air defense capabilities to help Ukraine defend [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=178.68s)]
*  its people, as well as armored infantry vehicles and more equipment that Ukraine is using to [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=182.84s)]
*  so effectively, including Javelin anti-tank missiles, artillery, ammunition, and conventional [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=189.0s)]
*  and long-range rockets for U.S.-provided HIMARS. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=194.32s)]
*  Additional information on this security package can be found on Defense.gov. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=197.6s)]
*  In regards to our announcement last night regarding the high-altitude surveillance balloon, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=202.22s)]
*  I'm not going to have much new information to provide other than to say that the North [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  American Aerospace Defense Command continues to monitor it closely. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=210.26s)]
*  While we won't get into specifics in regards to the exact location, I can tell you that [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=215.0s)]
*  the balloon continues to move eastward and is currently over the center of the continental [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=219.4s)]
*  United States. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Again, we currently assess that the balloon does not present a military or physical threat [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=225.16000000000003s)]
*  to people on the ground at this time, and we'll continue to review – excuse me, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=229.4s)]
*  continue to monitor and review options. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=233.96s)]
*  Finally, Secretary Austin will host a bilateral meeting today here in the Pentagon with Australian [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=235.96s)]
*  Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense Richard Marles. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=240.52s)]
*  The Secretary looks forward to discussing bilateral defense cooperation and our mutual [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=244.28s)]
*  security efforts within the Indo-Pacific region and beyond. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=248.98000000000002s)]
*  A full readout of the engagement will post later today to Defense.gov. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=252.28s)]
*  And with that, we'll go ahead and move to your questions. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=256.28s)]
*  We'll start with AP. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=258.36s)]
*  Tara Ka. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=260.12s)]
*  Hi, Pat. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=261.12s)]
*  Thank you for doing this. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=262.12s)]
*  China has said this is just a weather balloon that has veered off course. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=263.88s)]
*  Why is the Pentagon convinced that this is a surveillance balloon? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=267.56s)]
*  And then can you give us a little bit more on the status of the balloon? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=271.44s)]
*  You said it's in the central – of the – central U.S. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=274.76s)]
*  What state? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=278.36s)]
*  Do you have any guidance for people as they see this balloon or they're trying to photograph [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=279.36s)]
*  it or maybe try and interfere with it? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=282.84000000000003s)]
*  Sure. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=284.96000000000004s)]
*  Thanks, Tara. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=285.96000000000004s)]
*  So, first of all, we are aware of the PRC's statement. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=286.96000000000004s)]
*  However, the fact is we know that it's a surveillance balloon, and I'm not going [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=290.44s)]
*  to be able to be more specific than that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=295.8s)]
*  We do know that the balloon has violated U.S. airspace and international law, which is unacceptable. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  And so we've conveyed this directly to the PRC at multiple levels. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=304.04s)]
*  In terms of specific locations, I'm not going to be able to go into specific locations, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=309.12s)]
*  again, other than to say it's moving eastward at this time. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=313.52s)]
*  Yeah, you had a follow-up? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=316.47999999999996s)]
*  Well, just a quick follow-up on – as people start to see the balloon, do you have any [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  guidance for or should they try not to interfere or not photograph? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=323.59999999999997s)]
*  So, the balloon is currently assessed to be at about 60,000 feet, so again, well above [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=327.2s)]
*  the range of civilian air traffic or where civilian air traffic would normally fly. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=333.8s)]
*  I'm certainly aware that there are cameras – civilian-owned commercial cameras that [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=339.04s)]
*  could spot this balloon. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=344.56s)]
*  In terms of guidance to folks, again, this is something that NORAD is closely monitoring. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=346.72s)]
*  We do assess at this time that it does not pose a physical threat, as I mentioned, to [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=353.04s)]
*  people on the ground. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=358.88s)]
*  So we'll just leave it at that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=359.88s)]
*  Jennifer. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=361.92s)]
*  General Ryder, who is controlling this balloon right now? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=362.92s)]
*  Again, we know that this is a Chinese balloon, but beyond that, I'm not going to have specifics. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  You say that it's moving eastward and it's over the continental U.S. – it's not over [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=374.44s)]
*  Montana anymore. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=379.32s)]
*  Is the Chinese government controlling the movement of the balloon, or is it just floating [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=381.04s)]
*  with airstreams? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=385.64s)]
*  Thanks, Jennifer. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=386.64s)]
*  So I'm not going to go into any specific intelligence that we may have. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=387.64s)]
*  We know this is a Chinese balloon and that it has the ability to maneuver, but I'll [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=392.84s)]
*  just leave it at that. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=399.44s)]
*  And once it's over a body of water, will you shoot it down? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=400.44s)]
*  Again, right now we're monitoring the situation closely, reviewing options, but beyond that, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=404.59999999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to have any additional information. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=409.67999999999995s)]
*  We go to Tony. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=411.4s)]
*  One quickie on the balloon. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=413.55999999999995s)]
*  Can you confirm the photos that are out there that this is not the man in the moon and that [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  is the actual balloon? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  Thanks, Tony. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=422.0s)]
*  So certainly aware of photos being posted online, I'm not going to get into the business [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=423.32s)]
*  of confirming whether or not those are – where those photos come from. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=428.66s)]
*  Again, I can tell you that the U.S. government, NORAD, is monitoring this closely, and we [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=433.08000000000004s)]
*  will continue to review options. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=438.56s)]
*  How close was the U.S. to ordering – was the president to ordering a shoot down of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=439.8s)]
*  the balloon? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=443.6s)]
*  Yeah, so again, I'm not going to get into discussions, internal discussions within the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=444.6s)]
*  White House. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=449.36s)]
*  Again, right now we assess that there is no threat, physical threat or military threat [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=450.36s)]
*  to people on the ground, so we're continuing to monitor. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=455.6s)]
*  You know, then we'll just leave it at that. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=457.96000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=460.8s)]
*  Let me go to Janie, and then we'll go to Ryo. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=461.8s)]
*  Thanks, General. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=464.28000000000003s)]
*  Welcome to home. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=465.28000000000003s)]
*  I have two questions. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=467.24s)]
*  Is it coming? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=468.8s)]
*  Okay. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=470.44s)]
*  In response to Secretary Austin's recent remarks that more U.S. strategic assets will [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=471.44s)]
*  come to South Korea, North Korea want stronger provocations in the near future. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=479.64s)]
*  What is your comment on this? [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=488.44s)]
*  Well, it's certainly not surprising, given North Korea's track record of making bellicose [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=490.24s)]
*  statements. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=496.92s)]
*  Again, what we're focused on is on preserving peace, security and stability in the Indo-Pacific [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=497.92s)]
*  region. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=503.2s)]
*  And so Secretary Austin's visit was an opportunity to, again, reaffirm our strong and close [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=504.28s)]
*  alliance with the Republic of Korea. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=509.4s)]
*  And so that will remain our focus, is on working with South Korea and other nations in the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=511.79999999999995s)]
*  region to deter aggression and ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=516.8s)]
*  South Korea has announced that it will be test high-powered monster ballistic missile [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=523.04s)]
*  with nuclear warhead level. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=532.52s)]
*  This is a defense against North Korea's nuclear warhead. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=537.84s)]
*  How do you agree to this? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=543.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, Jeanne. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=545.6s)]
*  I missed the first part of your question. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=546.68s)]
*  South Korea has announced that it will be test high-powered monster ballistic missile [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=548.24s)]
*  with nuclear warhead level. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=558.52s)]
*  This is the defense against North Korea. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=562.56s)]
*  Yeah, I don't have anything on that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=564.12s)]
*  I'd refer you to government of South Korea. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=565.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=568.56s)]
*  Let me go to Rio and then I'll come back over here. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=569.56s)]
*  Okay, thank you very much. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=570.96s)]
*  Two questions on the Chinese balloon. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=572.64s)]
*  So there is a speculation that the Chinese balloon flew over Japanese airspace before [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=575.0799999999999s)]
*  reaching the continental U.S. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=580.96s)]
*  Can you confirm that? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=584.04s)]
*  I've seen those press reports. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=586.04s)]
*  As we acknowledged in our statement that we posted last night, we have seen this type [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=587.88s)]
*  of balloon activity elsewhere before. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=594.12s)]
*  But again, I'm not going to get into intelligence and I'm not going to have any further information [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=597.72s)]
*  to provide. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=602.4s)]
*  Secondly, how will this incident affect the Secretary's future engagement with Chinese [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=603.4s)]
*  counterpart to maintain the open lines of the communication? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=609.28s)]
*  I think we've been very clear that we're always open to maintaining an open line of communication [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=612.92s)]
*  with the PRC. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=618.16s)]
*  In that regard, nothing has changed. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=621.4399999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=623.04s)]
*  Let me go to Phil and then I'll come over to Kossom. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=624.04s)]
*  Is the position of the balloon classified? [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=626.04s)]
*  Phil, right now, what we're not going to do is get into an hour-by-hour location of the [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=628.8s)]
*  balloon. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=634.8s)]
*  Again, we're monitoring it closely. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=635.8s)]
*  As I mentioned right now, it's over the center of the continental United States. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=637.82s)]
*  That's about as specific as I'm going to get. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=642.2s)]
*  I understand my being convenient, but does the public not have a right to know if the [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=644.2800000000001s)]
*  balloon is over the state? [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=647.5600000000001s)]
*  The public certainly has the ability to look up in the sky and see where the balloon is. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=648.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=653.4000000000001s)]
*  Kossom? [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=654.4000000000001s)]
*  General, you said the balloon is maneuverable. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=655.4000000000001s)]
*  So does that mean that it's not drifting? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=658.96s)]
*  So the balloon is maneuverable. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=662.24s)]
*  Clearly it's violated U.S. airspace. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=664.84s)]
*  And again, we've communicated that fact to the PRC. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=668.2s)]
*  If possible, can you tell us if the balloon, when it enters the U.S. airspace, has it changed [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=672.72s)]
*  its course in any way? [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=678.4399999999999s)]
*  The balloon has changed its course, which is again why we're monitoring it. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=681.96s)]
*  But that's about as specific as I can get. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=686.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=688.2s)]
*  Go to Matt. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=689.2s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=690.2s)]
*  So you've said at this point the balloon doesn't pose to have any – to pose any risks to [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=691.2s)]
*  citizens. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=696.72s)]
*  How is it that the U.S. can assess that, given that the balloon is at such an altitude, you [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=697.8399999999999s)]
*  know, without actually getting eyes on it up close and assessing the equipment that's [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=702.12s)]
*  on board? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=705.24s)]
*  And secondly, are there any alternatives being considered to shooting it down? [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=706.24s)]
*  Is there any option to take this balloon out of the sky intact to maybe get a better look [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=710.24s)]
*  at that equipment? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=714.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=715.64s)]
*  So again, this is a surveillance balloon, hover – you know, operating at about 60,000 [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=716.64s)]
*  feet. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=723.92s)]
*  Clearly, you know, we did a very close assessment in terms of what it's doing. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=725.56s)]
*  And as I mentioned, military commanders have assessed that there is no physical or military [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=731.8s)]
*  threat to people on the ground. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=738.16s)]
*  And so in that regard, we'll continue to monitor. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=741.02s)]
*  In terms of way ahead, we will continue to review options, but I'm not going to have [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=744.88s)]
*  anything further to provide on that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=748.64s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=750.36s)]
*  Thank you, ma'am. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=751.36s)]
*  Thank you, Pat. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=755.12s)]
*  You said that this is violating our airspace, so why not take it down? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=756.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=761.7199999999999s)]
*  So, you know, clearly as we assess options and considering the size of the payload on [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=762.7199999999999s)]
*  this, looking at the potential for debris and the impact on civilians on the ground [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=769.76s)]
*  damage, again, running through the various factors and looking at in terms of does it [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=777.68s)]
*  pose a potential risk to people while in the air? [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=785.88s)]
*  And right now, as I mentioned, we assess that it does not pose a risk to people on the ground [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=791.04s)]
*  as it currently is traversing the continental United States. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=795.64s)]
*  And so out of an abundance of caution, cognizant of the potential impact to civilians on the [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=799.28s)]
*  ground from a debris field, right now we're going to continue to monitor and review options. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=804.4000000000001s)]
*  And if I may, you mentioned that we've seen this kind of activity before. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=809.6s)]
*  So why are we sharing this one and why last night if you were following it for a few days, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=813.48s)]
*  is this some sort of sign that we should take from China ahead of Blinken's visit or from [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=818.36s)]
*  the activity that we had in the Philippines? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=822.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=825.1600000000001s)]
*  So in terms of any, you know, hypotheticals about messaging from PRC, I'd refer you to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=826.1600000000001s)]
*  them on that front. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=832.0400000000001s)]
*  Again, I think what makes this different is the duration and the length of which it has [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=833.4000000000001s)]
*  been over U.S. territory. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=839.8000000000001s)]
*  But beyond that, I'm not going to be able to go into any more specifics. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=842.24s)]
*  Mike. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=845.2800000000001s)]
*  Thanks, Pat. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=849.2800000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, a senior defense official said that the intelligence-gathering capability [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=850.2800000000001s)]
*  of this balloon would be no better than any Chinese satellite in low-Earth orbit. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=856.08s)]
*  If that's the case, why would Beijing go through the trouble and expense to send this balloon [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=861.52s)]
*  on such a journey? [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=868.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'd have to refer you back to PRC on that. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=869.0s)]
*  Any opinion why? [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=872.72s)]
*  Again, look, we're monitoring this. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=873.72s)]
*  As I mentioned, it's violated U.S. airspace. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=875.96s)]
*  It's violated international law. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=879.24s)]
*  We've communicated that back to the government of China. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=881.12s)]
*  But again, I'd refer you back to China in terms of... [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=886.4399999999999s)]
*  But I assume that the Pentagon is trying to figure this out itself, why they're bothering [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=890.36s)]
*  to do this if they can already...if it's offering no better intelligence-gathering than from [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=895.72s)]
*  a satellite, right? [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=900.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, again, I mean, that's a statement, not a question. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=902.7600000000001s)]
*  So yeah. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=905.72s)]
*  Okay, go to question mark and begin to... [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=906.72s)]
*  Yeah, again, I'm not going to have anything other to provide. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=908.5200000000001s)]
*  So ma'am. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=911.32s)]
*  Yeah, go to her and then come back to Nancy here. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=915.32s)]
*  I was wondering, is there any way that the Pentagon is able to gauge how long it could [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=919.5200000000001s)]
*  potentially loiter, comparing to balloons that have been in the past? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=924.2s)]
*  And how long do you anticipate that it could loiter? [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=930.2800000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=933.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so as I mentioned, we'll continue to monitor it. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=934.5600000000001s)]
*  Right now, we assess that it'll probably be over the United States for a few days, but [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=937.7600000000001s)]
*  we'll continue to monitor, review our options, and keep you updated as we can. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=943.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=948.84s)]
*  Okay, let me go to Nancy here. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=949.84s)]
*  Hi, General. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=954.84s)]
*  I want to go back to a couple of things you said. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=955.84s)]
*  You said several times that the U.S. is reviewing its options. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=957.84s)]
*  I'd like to some clarity, is the option of shooting down the balloon, particularly as [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=962.04s)]
*  it's going over more populated areas, off the table? [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=967.48s)]
*  Is that still amongst the options that the U.S. military is considering? [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=971.16s)]
*  And if so, under what conditions would it do so? [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=974.4s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Nancy. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=976.4399999999999s)]
*  So at this stage, what I can tell you is, again, we're reviewing options. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=978.24s)]
*  I'm not going to go into more specifics than that, and when and if there's any updates [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=983.12s)]
*  to provide, we'll let you know. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=987.2800000000001s)]
*  It's been ruled out, shooting. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=988.2800000000001s)]
*  Again, we're monitoring it, and we're reviewing options. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=989.2800000000001s)]
*  Let's leave it there. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=992.2800000000001s)]
*  And then a senior defense official yesterday said that similar incidents had happened under [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=993.2800000000001s)]
*  the previous administration, and yet some of those administration officials have come [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=998.72s)]
*  forward and said they're not familiar with it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1002.6800000000001s)]
*  Is there any way you could give us more details on when it's happened over, whether it was [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1004.76s)]
*  over the continental U.S. or over U.S. territories? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1008.76s)]
*  Is that something you could potentially take to provide the public more details about the [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1011.9200000000001s)]
*  extent that these things happen? [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1016.08s)]
*  So what I would tell you right now is that information is classified. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1017.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm not able to provide it other than I can confirm that there have been other incidents [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1022.36s)]
*  where balloons did come close to or across over U.S. territory. [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1029.4s)]
*  And then I just want to reiterate something that Phil said earlier, that given that it's [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1034.28s)]
*  not classified and the public can see it, I just ask that you take the question that [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1037.44s)]
*  we have more specifics on where it is, given that there's no clear security reason by your [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1041.28s)]
*  own estimation in terms of keeping that information from the top. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1046.6000000000001s)]
*  Sure. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1050.04s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1051.04s)]
*  And again, you know, we're just not going to get into an hour by hour where the balloon [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1052.04s)]
*  is, so we will do our best to keep you and the public informed in general terms on where [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1056.64s)]
*  the balloon is and, you know, try to be helpful in that regard. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1061.88s)]
*  I think we're in a guessing game where people think it's flying over. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  I just think some fidelity would be in everybody. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1071.2800000000002s)]
*  Understood. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1073.48s)]
*  And again, I think a key point here to make and to purposefully belabor the point, which [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1074.48s)]
*  is that, again, as this balloon traverses the continental United States, we assess that [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1080.0s)]
*  it currently does not pose a physical or military risk to people on the ground. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1085.3200000000002s)]
*  So we will continue to monitor, we'll continue to review our options and provide information [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1088.96s)]
*  and updates as we're able to. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1093.76s)]
*  So Jennifer? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1095.08s)]
*  If it approaches Washington, D.C., will you shoot it down? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1096.08s)]
*  Again, Jennifer, we're reviewing options, but I'm not going to get into hypotheticals [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1100.16s)]
*  or speculate on potential future actions. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1103.2s)]
*  So let me go to the back of the room here and then I'll come up to Joe. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1105.56s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1110.2s)]
*  Thinking about the, you know, route of the balloon, was it impossible for the DOD to [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1112.8400000000001s)]
*  deal with the balloon before it reached to the airspace of the United States? [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1117.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah, so we've been monitoring the balloon. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  You know, we are aware, again, as I mentioned, it is a maneuverable craft and we continue [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1127.04s)]
*  to assess and make appropriate decisions based on how we're going to address what we perceive [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1134.1999999999998s)]
*  as a potential threat or not. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1141.28s)]
*  The safety and security of the American people is paramount. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1143.8s)]
*  And so, again, at this time, we assess that it does not pose a physical threat to people [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1147.3600000000001s)]
*  on the ground. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1151.96s)]
*  We'll continue to monitor it and we'll continue to review options. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1152.96s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1156.44s)]
*  Let me go ahead and go to Joe here and then we'll come back to this side of the room. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1157.44s)]
*  So you said that this is the first time we've, this isn't the first time we've seen a balloon [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1160.4s)]
*  fly over the continental U.S. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1166.0800000000002s)]
*  In the past, has it flown over other sensitive areas such as military bases? [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1168.96s)]
*  You've only, you haven't been very specific. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1175.2s)]
*  It's just the continental U.S. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1177.8400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, no, I appreciate it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1179.48s)]
*  I haven't been very specific because that information is classified and I'm just not [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1180.48s)]
*  going to be able to talk about it. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1183.4s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1184.8s)]
*  Idris. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1186.4s)]
*  The Canadian defense ministry yesterday said they were tracking a second potential spy [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1187.4s)]
*  balloon. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1193.24s)]
*  Are you tracking a second potential incident? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1194.24s)]
*  When the balloon was coming, I guess what I'm confused about is when were there discussions [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1198.64s)]
*  to shoot down the balloon? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1203.04s)]
*  Were there any discussions about shooting down the balloon when it was not over the [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1204.52s)]
*  United States, when it was potentially over international waters or were the discussions [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1207.04s)]
*  only when it entered U.S. airspace? [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1210.96s)]
*  Yeah, thanks Idris. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1212.72s)]
*  So on your first question, we are tracking one balloon. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1213.88s)]
*  So in regards to statements by Canada, I'd refer you back to them on that. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1218.72s)]
*  In terms of the discussions about whether or not to shoot down this balloon, that was [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1224.1s)]
*  an option, right? [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1232.26s)]
*  And so that was something that was taken into consideration. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1233.54s)]
*  Again, because we assess that currently it does not pose a physical or military risk [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1237.46s)]
*  to people on the ground, for now we are continuing to monitor and review options. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1243.22s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1248.82s)]
*  I'll go back to Ellie and then we'll come up here. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1249.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1253.1s)]
*  How big is the balloon that you're tracking and is it, have you guys picked up, is it [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1254.34s)]
*  leaving anything in its wake like sensors? [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1259.22s)]
*  Yeah, so on your latter question, I'm not going to get into intelligence. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1261.98s)]
*  We do continue to monitor the balloon. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1268.4199999999998s)]
*  We do know that it is a surveillance balloon. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1269.94s)]
*  In terms of the size, I'm not able to get into the specifics other than to say that [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1272.98s)]
*  it is big enough that again, in reviewing our approach, we do recognize that any potential [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1277.9s)]
*  debris field would be significant and potentially cause civilian injuries or deaths or significant [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1286.02s)]
*  property damage. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1294.3400000000001s)]
*  So again, this is part of the calculus in terms of our overall assessment. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1295.3400000000001s)]
*  But again, we'll continue to monitor it. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1298.46s)]
*  We'll continue to review our options and keep you updated as able. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1300.6200000000001s)]
*  Let me go here and then over here. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1304.3400000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1307.82s)]
*  Following up on the balloon question, during your conversation with the Chinese, have they [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1308.34s)]
*  indicated to you what is inside the balloon to prove the point that it's a civilian balloon [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1314.18s)]
*  or weather monitoring thing? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1319.22s)]
*  And does that assessment differs from your assessment of what is inside the balloon, [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1320.42s)]
*  what it's trying to do? [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1324.7s)]
*  And secondly, on the India question, this week, India and US launched a initiative on [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1326.3799999999999s)]
*  critical emerging technologies. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1331.26s)]
*  This has quite a bit of defense component in it. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1333.22s)]
*  Can you give us some more details about it and how it's going to strengthen or build [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1336.26s)]
*  up your relationship with India? [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1340.06s)]
*  Sure. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1341.86s)]
*  On your second question, I'll have to take that because I just don't have that information [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1342.86s)]
*  in front of me. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1345.98s)]
*  On the first question, I appreciate it. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1347.14s)]
*  As I mentioned, we have contacted the PRC. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1349.58s)]
*  I'm not going to get into their reaction. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1352.3s)]
*  I'd refer you to them for that. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1355.14s)]
*  But we have clearly communicated that this balloon is violating US airspace and international [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1357.46s)]
*  law and that this is unacceptable. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1362.98s)]
*  Over here and then go over here. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1366.1000000000001s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1368.74s)]
*  Is the pending on looking at any possibility of maybe altering the course of the balloons, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1369.74s)]
*  take us to a location where they can shoot it down in a rural area? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1374.6200000000001s)]
*  Again, monitoring, we're reviewing options, but I'm not going to go into any further specifics. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1377.98s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1383.18s)]
*  Sir? [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1384.18s)]
*  Considering that this is a surveillance balloon, as you said, does it have ability to collect [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1385.18s)]
*  very sensitive data given that it flies over nuclear sites in the state of Montana? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1391.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1397.22s)]
*  So again, I'm not going to get into intelligence. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1398.22s)]
*  As we mentioned in our statement last night, once the balloon was detected, we acted immediately [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1402.1s)]
*  to protect against the collection of sensitive information. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1407.58s)]
*  And I'll just leave it at that. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1410.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1412.58s)]
*  Phil? [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1413.58s)]
*  Is there any possibility that there's any nuclear or radioactive material aboard the [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1414.58s)]
*  balloon or is there anything that's aboard the balloon that makes you believe that it [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1417.1s)]
*  could pose a risk if it were shot down? [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1421.14s)]
*  Short answer is no. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1424.6200000000001s)]
*  But again, right now we do not assess that the balloon in its current configuration at [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1426.22s)]
*  approximately 60,000 feet poses a physical or military threat to people on the ground. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1431.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1436.98s)]
*  Joe? [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1437.98s)]
*  Ukraine question. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1438.98s)]
*  The small diameter bomb in the latest Ukraine aid package has the potential to target Crimea [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1443.6200000000001s)]
*  Is that the intent behind providing it now? [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1449.9799999999998s)]
*  So thanks for the question, Joe. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1454.4199999999998s)]
*  So yes, as part of the USAI package, we will be providing ground launch small diameter [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1456.26s)]
*  bombs to Ukraine. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1462.86s)]
*  This gives them a longer range capability, long range fires capability that will enable [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1465.6799999999998s)]
*  them again to conduct operations in defense of their country and to take back their sovereign [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1472.1399999999999s)]
*  territory in Russian occupied areas. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1477.82s)]
*  When it comes to Ukrainian plans on operations, clearly that is their decision there in the [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1480.6599999999999s)]
*  lead for those. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1487.4199999999998s)]
*  So I'm not going to talk about or speculate about potential future operations. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1488.5s)]
*  But again, all along we've been working with them to provide them with capabilities that [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1493.1s)]
*  will enable them to be effective on the battlefield. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1497.62s)]
*  And just as a follow up to that, can you talk specifically about this particular group of [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1500.3s)]
*  capabilities? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1505.9399999999998s)]
*  How are they tailored to what's happening in Ukraine now? [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1507.42s)]
*  For instance, there's equipment that connects the various air defense systems. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1510.8600000000001s)]
*  Just can you speak to why this specific package now? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1516.74s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1519.7s)]
*  So again, it's important to look at this from an evolution standpoint in terms of adapting [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1520.7s)]
*  to the conditions on the ground. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1526.8400000000001s)]
*  And so we've been focused on several key areas in the last few months to support Ukraine, [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1528.6200000000001s)]
*  air defense capabilities, armor capabilities, long range fires capabilities, and then combined [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1535.54s)]
*  with training in order to enable them to have the ability to conduct combined arms. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1542.78s)]
*  And so looking at things like further enhancing and enabling their integrated air defense, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1549.48s)]
*  which I think everyone continues to watch with horror as Russia conducts aerial bombardment [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1554.66s)]
*  on civilian targets throughout Ukraine. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1560.8999999999999s)]
*  So working with them in those areas, but also through the combined arms training, enabling [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1564.06s)]
*  them to be able to change the equation on the front lines, not only defend their territory, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1569.62s)]
*  but take back sovereign territory. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1574.3799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1576.02s)]
*  Tony. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1577.02s)]
*  Just to specify on that one, within the announcement, there's a one line that says precision guided [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1578.02s)]
*  rockets. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1582.62s)]
*  Is that the ground launched? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1583.62s)]
*  That is the ground launch small diameter bomb. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1584.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1587.26s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1588.26s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1589.26s)]
*  Tara? [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1590.26s)]
*  Just going back to the Ukraine package, can you talk a little bit more about integrating [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1594.06s)]
*  the air defense systems, particularly all the systems that have been sent by different [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1600.6599999999999s)]
*  NATO partners and how do you integrate those with the systems Ukraine already has? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1604.34s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1609.3s)]
*  So without going into operationally sensitive matters, broadly speaking, so a couple of [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1610.3s)]
*  things. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1618.02s)]
*  So that's important to recognize that the Ukrainians already have done a fairly remarkable [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1620.02s)]
*  job of protecting, you know, of employing the air defense capabilities that they have. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1625.02s)]
*  That said, we do recognize that as they take these new pieces and parts and integrate it [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1631.06s)]
*  into their system, support, continued support is required. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1636.06s)]
*  And so we consult regularly with the Ukrainians and our international allies and partners [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1639.9s)]
*  and how they can best integrate those systems. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1643.74s)]
*  So that is ongoing work, you know, but again, they've been doing a pretty remarkable job [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1646.54s)]
*  of intercepting Russian missiles and drones. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1651.8999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1655.22s)]
*  All right. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1656.22s)]
*  Time for just a couple more. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1657.22s)]
*  Oren? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1658.22s)]
*  Two questions on the balloon. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1659.22s)]
*  First on maneuverability. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1660.34s)]
*  Can it maneuver up and down as well as laterally? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1661.58s)]
*  In other words, turn as well as change altitude? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1663.6599999999999s)]
*  And in terms of tracking, how are you tracking this? [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1666.8999999999999s)]
*  Is it radar? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1668.94s)]
*  Is it aircraft? [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1669.94s)]
*  And is it continuous tracking or is it more intermittent than that? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1670.94s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1674.1s)]
*  Thanks, Oren. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1675.1s)]
*  I'm not saying that we are continuously tracking the balloon. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1676.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to go into the specifics in terms of how we track other than to say that [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1679.8999999999999s)]
*  we have multiple means at our disposal to do that. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1684.78s)]
*  In terms of more specifics on the balloon, again, I'm not going to get into intelligence, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1688.06s)]
*  again, other than it is maneuverable. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1693.3s)]
*  And I'll just leave it at that. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1695.3s)]
*  All right. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1697.6599999999999s)]
*  Two more questions, Phil, and then Kasim. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1698.6599999999999s)]
*  The Chinese, you said it changed course. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1699.6599999999999s)]
*  Did it change course following your disclosure of its presence over the United States? [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1703.02s)]
*  And secondly, to the point about its capabilities, how is it powered? [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1708.02s)]
*  How is it moving? [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1716.42s)]
*  How is it maneuverable? [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1719.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1720.42s)]
*  Thanks, Phil. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1721.42s)]
*  So again, on your latter question, I'm not going to get into intelligence. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1722.42s)]
*  Clearly, it's a balloon that has a payload underneath it. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1724.8200000000002s)]
*  I'll just leave it at that. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1728.26s)]
*  What's that? [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1732.6599999999999s)]
*  What do you mean by payload? [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1733.6599999999999s)]
*  It's got a large payload underneath the surveillance component, underneath the actual balloon piece [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1734.9399999999998s)]
*  of it. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1741.02s)]
*  So, just leave it at that. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1742.02s)]
*  And then in terms of the maneuverability, again, all I can say right now is at this [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1745.1s)]
*  point, again, it's moving eastward across the United States, currently over about the [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1752.4199999999998s)]
*  central United States. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1757.02s)]
*  Did it change course after your disclosure or did it change course beyond that? [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1758.42s)]
*  I don't have that information. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1762.78s)]
*  Yep. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1764.78s)]
*  Sorry about payload. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1765.78s)]
*  That sounds like munitions or something that would pose a threat to U.S. citizens. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1766.78s)]
*  No, again, it is a surveillance balloon, right? [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1771.78s)]
*  So there is a surveillance capability underneath this large balloon, right? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1775.54s)]
*  So look at a blimp. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1783.1399999999999s)]
*  A blimp has a basket, right? [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1785.3799999999999s)]
*  So there's a basket underneath it in layman's terms. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1787.78s)]
*  So again, large enough to be concerning if there were a debris field. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1792.5s)]
*  So all right, Qasem, last question. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1797.3799999999999s)]
*  Has there been any mail-to-mail communication with China with respect to the balloon? [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1799.58s)]
*  Again, we've communicated at multiple levels and I'll just leave it at that. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1804.74s)]
*  Okay. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1807.98s)]
*  Sorry, I don't know if you said, but is it munitions? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1808.98s)]
*  It is a surveillance balloon. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1813.16s)]
*  Again, does not pose, we currently assess it does not pose a physical or military risk [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1814.8200000000002s)]
*  to people on the ground. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1819.6200000000001s)]
*  Okay, what could payload that? [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1820.6200000000001s)]
*  Is it an engine? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1822.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm just, I'm trying to- [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1823.6200000000001s)]
*  Again, I can't go into more details. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1824.6200000000001s)]
*  So okay, thank you very much everybody. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1826.8200000000002s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ADAejpPs-y8&t=1828.6200000000001s)]
