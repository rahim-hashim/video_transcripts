# Fmr Navy Secretary warns challenges in Middle East will get worse
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU)
*  When it comes to these Iranian proxies and it comes to these attacks in places like Iraq [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=0.0s)]
*  and Syria, I don't want to minimize the danger that those present. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=5.76s)]
*  But most of those attacks have been largely unsuccessful, whereas our strikes are always [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  on target and they're always going to hit the intended target, and it's going to diminish [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=17.12s)]
*  IRGC and Iranian proxy capability in the region. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=22.0s)]
*  So our forces in general... [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=26.560000000000002s)]
*  But it doesn't, right? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  No disrespect, sir, but if it did, then Iran would stop this and these Iranian proxy attacks [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  would cycle back. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=35.12s)]
*  They're not. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=37.72s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, again, this is not the first time these groups have conducted these kinds [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=38.72s)]
*  of attacks, so clearly it's an effort to try to exploit the situation. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=43.54s)]
*  All right, General Ryder on that over at the Pentagon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  So what to do about these attacks? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=51.04s)]
*  He says ours are targeted in specific, but are they too few? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=53.16s)]
*  Let's get into that with Kenneth Greatwait, the former secretary of the Navy. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=56.36s)]
*  Former U.S. ambassador to Norway. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=59.72s)]
*  Ambassador, great to have you. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  What do you make of what the general was saying, sir, this idea that it isn't about the number [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  per attack, it's about the precision of those attacks, but isn't that also part of the problem? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=69.03999999999999s)]
*  They're just too few to respond. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=75.8s)]
*  Neil, it's great to be with you and appreciate the opportunity to engage with your audience [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=77.84s)]
*  here this morning. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=83.32s)]
*  This is a very multi-dimensional complex issue, as you know. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=85.08s)]
*  The short answer is we're not doing enough, although we've moved two carrier strike groups [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=89.16s)]
*  into the region. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=93.92s)]
*  We haven't had a carrier strike group in the Eastern Meds since 2021. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=95.2s)]
*  And if there's anything that the Iranians respect, they respect military strength. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  You know, they'll continue through their proxies, you know, to up this game and to create the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=105.16s)]
*  instability in the region that we've seen because it's to their advantage to do this. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=110.82s)]
*  I mean, we all know on the eve of the October 7th attack that Saudi Arabia and Israel were [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=114.96s)]
*  in negotiations in a process of coming to an understanding for the first in the history [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=120.12s)]
*  of their relationship. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=127.24s)]
*  So we need to understand the greater dynamic here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=129.74s)]
*  And really, one of the aspects of this is although we're able to respond now, we're [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=132.66s)]
*  not being proactive enough. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=138.76s)]
*  And there are a lot of implications to that, especially when it comes to the forces available. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=140.96s)]
*  There's a lot of discussion today that we just really don't have the naval presence [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=146.64000000000001s)]
*  to be able to cover down on all of these potential challenges. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=150.36s)]
*  Jennifer just mentioned my classmate, Chris Lung-Aqualino, will be on the panel with her [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=155.52s)]
*  today. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=160.6s)]
*  You know, he has to deal with this on a daily basis. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=161.6s)]
*  This is only going to get worse as we continue not to invest in our military to the degree [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=165.08s)]
*  that we really need to, Neil. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=169.52s)]
*  You know, General, it might be just coincidence, but it's darn weird coincidence that there [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=171.04000000000002s)]
*  were no such attacks on American forces throughout the week. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=176.16000000000003s)]
*  We had this ceasefire, whatever you want to call it, pause in activity in effect. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=179.98000000000002s)]
*  And as soon as that pause ended, you know, attacks and activity was being cited again. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=185.72s)]
*  There's no doubt in the eyes of many of your president and former colleagues that Iran [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=196.32s)]
*  is busy and Iran is calling the shots quite literally. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=201.76s)]
*  But if there is no hope of a pause being resumed again and Israel, as you know, walked out [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=205.44s)]
*  at talks and cut her because the talks were going nowhere for one, then I guess we can [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  anticipate more attacks on U.S. soldiers. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=214.84s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  Those are attacks of opportunity, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=218.64s)]
*  The bigger issue here is understanding that the forces at play are going to continue to [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=222.84s)]
*  seek these opportunities to create the instability in the region. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=229.0s)]
*  And again, there are a few things that the Iranians respect, but they do respect military [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  strength. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=238.51999999999998s)]
*  And you know, it's funny, Neil, because you call me General, I was actually an Admiral, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=239.56s)]
*  but that's OK. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=243.0s)]
*  I won't take that the wrong way. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=244.0s)]
*  Anyway, armies win wars, but navies prevent wars. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=247.6s)]
*  And we have not invested in our navy to the degree that we need to. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=253.64s)]
*  I mean, even now with the increase in the president's budget, it's not keeping up with [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=256.8s)]
*  inflation. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=260.96s)]
*  And instead of building more ships, we're actually removing more from the fleet. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=262.2s)]
*  This year, we'll cut almost a dozen ships out of our naval forces. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=267.24s)]
*  And just two days ago, I was talking with one of my dear friends, a former commander, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=271.52s)]
*  Admiral Jamie Fogo, who would have been responsible a couple of years ago for the current challenges [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=276.4s)]
*  that we see in Eastern Med. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=282.59999999999997s)]
*  And as such, Jamie has indicated the bigger underlying thing here is we're not able to [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=285.12s)]
*  provide the forces in a manner that's consistent with the availability, because then you've [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=291.67999999999995s)]
*  got all of the challenges that come with rushing to meet the challenge and then having to bring [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=297.0s)]
*  the ships back and providing opportunities to repair them. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=302.0s)]
*  All right, Admiral, thank you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=305.4s)]
*  I believe when I said General was referring to General Patrick Ryder, but if I misspoke [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=306.64s)]
*  instead of you, I apologize. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=310.6s)]
*  But Admiral, you got that, you got the Ambassador thing, you got an impressive resume. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=312.36s)]
*  Thank you very much for taking the time. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=317.08s)]
*  Oh no, I'm never going to do that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=319.08s)]
*  No, I'm not going to do that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=320.08s)]
*  Thank you, Admiral. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=321.08s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEzjXA4TxBU&t=322.08s)]
