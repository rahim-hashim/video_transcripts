# Israeli military preps for Gaza attack by air, land, sea
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU)
*  The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=0.0s)]
*  scenes from several fronts of the war as fighting in Israel reaches its eighth day. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=16.54s)]
*  This has tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers prepare for a full-scale invasion of Gaza. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=21.04s)]
*  We are just learning that Secretary of State Antony Blinken will return to Israel Monday [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=26.28s)]
*  for further talks following a visit to other leaders in the Middle East. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=30.64s)]
*  IDF issuing a statement saying forces are currently preparing to implement a wide range [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=34.92s)]
*  of operational offensive plans which can include combined and coordinated strikes from the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=40.3s)]
*  air, land and sea. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=46.040000000000006s)]
*  At least 1,300 Israelis and 29 U.S. citizens have been killed in the fighting so far. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=48.88s)]
*  The New York Times reports that Israeli forces have delayed their initial plans as weather [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  conditions in the area could worsen. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=59.63999999999999s)]
*  Meanwhile, a second U.S. aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mediterranean Sea in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=62.44s)]
*  what Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calls a show of force as the U.S. continues to affirm [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=66.92s)]
*  its support for Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=72.92s)]
*  Despite that, Iran is now warning Israel to stop the fighting immediately, saying any [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  further action they take will cause a quote, huge earthquake for Israel if the operation [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=80.12s)]
*  in Gaza continues. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=86.08s)]
*  And now let's get to Mike Tobin on the ground in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=89.2s)]
*  Mike? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=93.36s)]
*  Well, with troops at the ready, good morning, gang. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=94.36s)]
*  With troops at the ready and so much anticipation that the ground offensive would have started [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=97.8s)]
*  by now, you can see the artillery sits behind me at the moment. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=101.52s)]
*  The guns are quiet and the ground offensive did not materialize. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=105.16s)]
*  You've seen the reporting from the New York Times saying that the weather was the reason [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=108.68s)]
*  that the troops didn't go in, that the drones and the other aircraft wouldn't be able to [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=112.24s)]
*  spot as much detail on the ground. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=115.64s)]
*  What I'm getting from the sources, weather is just one of the factors. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=117.64s)]
*  They really want to optimize all of the factors before they move in and minimize the risk [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=120.84s)]
*  to the soldiers who are accompanying all the armor that's going to be part of this anticipated [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=126.44s)]
*  ground offensive. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=131.94s)]
*  Still, the Israeli aircraft continue to pummel targets overnight. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=132.94s)]
*  Israel claims they got another high-value target, an individual named Bilal al-Kendra. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=137.24s)]
*  They say that he is a part of this Nukba. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=141.84s)]
*  They call him a naval commando force that was central in the planning of this October [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=145.92s)]
*  7th massacre. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=150.44s)]
*  Specifically, they say that Bilal al-Kendra was responsible for planning the attack at [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=151.44s)]
*  Kibbutz Nireem. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=156.64s)]
*  This is the third high-value target that Israel says they've got by airstrikes over the last [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=158.16s)]
*  three days. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=163.44s)]
*  Other operatives with Hamas and Islamic Jihad have also been killed, according to Israel, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=164.84s)]
*  with 100 airstrikes conducted overnight. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=170.72s)]
*  The northern border is still extremely tense. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=173.48s)]
*  Rockets came across the border overnight. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=176.48s)]
*  There was a strike in a town called Shtula. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=178.83999999999997s)]
*  In that town, an Israeli Arab, meaning an Arab man with Israeli citizenship, was killed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=182.04s)]
*  He was working on the farms up there. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=187.48s)]
*  He was killed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=189.23999999999998s)]
*  Two others were injured. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  Dozens of rockets continued to fly over that border. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  Israel has responded. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=195.11999999999998s)]
*  Thus far, that hasn't melted down into another front. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  We sit here watching the Gaza border in the south of the country as these soldiers are [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=199.64s)]
*  waiting to get their orders. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  You saw they got the visit from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu yesterday telling them [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=206.04s)]
*  that the next stage is coming. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  So far, the order has not come. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=212.54s)]
*  Guys, back to you in New York. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=214.27999999999997s)]
*  Mike, you said it's a multitude of factors, weather being one of them, but it's also, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=215.76s)]
*  it's got to be evacuation of folks in northern Gaza, which we've seen disrupted by Hamas [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  at many levels. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=227.27999999999997s)]
*  And also, the coordination it takes to bring in that many troops and do it effectively [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=228.68s)]
*  and move in decisively. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=232.5s)]
*  Comment on any of that, but also I've heard reports that the rules of engagement for Israeli [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=235.36s)]
*  soldiers have been loosened a little bit in the expectation that when they go into north [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=239.68s)]
*  Gaza, they're going in against anyone there is someone that can be considered an enemy. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=243.8s)]
*  Can you report on any of that? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=249.24s)]
*  Well, one of the things that we've seen with Israel in the past, when they go into the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=251.04s)]
*  Gaza Strip, they'll lay down a bunch of scorched earth with the idea that anyone who's not [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=256.56s)]
*  a combatant would leave. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=261.64s)]
*  They've issued this warning telling anyone who's not a combatant to leave. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=263.56s)]
*  We do know that there still is personnel in the northern end of the Gaza Strip, meaning [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=267.08s)]
*  Hamas or Islamic Jihad fighting personnel, because the rockets continue to come out. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=270.96s)]
*  We know that there's a network of tunnels. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=276.08s)]
*  We know that they anticipate that as the Israeli front line advances, there's the potential [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=278.12s)]
*  that fighters could pop up behind them and attack from the rear because of the tunnels. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=283.64000000000004s)]
*  They do have a great deal of intelligence about the tunnels, but you have to doubt that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=287.96000000000004s)]
*  they've exhausted all of the intelligence about the tunnels. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=292.12s)]
*  But we've seen in the past, even with fighting in the West Bank, as these radical Islamic [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=295.8s)]
*  fighters retreat, they leave behind booby traps. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=301.76s)]
*  So it's fraught with peril as the Israelis prepare to go in, and they're trying to do [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=304.68s)]
*  everything they can to minimize the risk to their own troops. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=308.96000000000004s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=312.76000000000005s)]
*  All right, Mike Tobin, thank you so much. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=313.76000000000005s)]
*  Mike, thank you. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=315.68s)]
*  We'll check in with you a little bit later in the show. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=316.68s)]
*  I do want to bring up, you know, talking about Gaza. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=318.32000000000005s)]
*  I don't think this is the type of analysis that should lead to paralysis, but it's always [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=322.72s)]
*  important to understand and ask yourself what comes next. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=328.44000000000005s)]
*  And we probably did not sufficiently have an answer to that question before we went [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=332.12s)]
*  into Afghanistan. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=335.6s)]
*  Or Ukraine. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=336.6s)]
*  And that you brought it up earlier, Pete. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  What happens next in Gaza has got to be part of the conversation today, at least for the [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=339.88s)]
*  government of Israel. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=345.52s)]
*  Meaning, occupy true occupation, not what is called now an occupation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=347.0s)]
*  Turn it back over. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=354.24s)]
*  Turn it over to who? [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=355.28s)]
*  Because Hamas is the ruling, essentially, government of Gaza. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=357.08s)]
*  And the point is to cut out Hamas, like a cancer. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=361.08s)]
*  Then what comes next? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=364.24s)]
*  All of these questions are very monumental about what happens. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=365.8s)]
*  I mean, the task of an invasion and a hostage rescue and all of that is monumental. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=369.88s)]
*  And it probably pales into comparison of the task that follows. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=374.76s)]
*  And all of that does, you're exactly right, all of that does impact how you move through [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=378.24s)]
*  in the first place as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=382.64s)]
*  But I've read multiple reports and heard from people that say, it's this all happened so [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=384.2s)]
*  fast that there hasn't been a full reckoning with what the next phase looks like. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=387.68s)]
*  And I think part of it might be what kind of resistance they face and what kind of combat [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=395.38s)]
*  they encounter, how the hostage situation unfolds. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=399.98s)]
*  So I don't know that they know what that end state is right now. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=403.86s)]
*  You don't always have the convenience of knowing what that looks like. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=406.18s)]
*  Rooting out Hamas, I mean, you're right, the elected, well, now the permanent government [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=410.58s)]
*  there, but also a terrorist organization that's killed 1,300 of your citizens, innocents. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=415.38s)]
*  I don't know that they've thought it all through, nor had the opportunity. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=421.1s)]
*  And for the role of Iran in this, who is now saying, if you do, if you go into Gaza with [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=424.3s)]
*  ground forces, we're going to get involved as well. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=428.86s)]
*  And they said we're going to cause an earthquake for Israel. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=432.09999999999997s)]
*  Then the question then becomes, how does that impact America? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=435.9s)]
*  Do we end up getting involved and drawn into this? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=439.9s)]
*  After all, we have some hostages that are Americans and also those killed. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=442.46s)]
*  So it is very complicated. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=447.97999999999996s)]
*  And thinking ahead, I'm so glad you brought that up. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-AhnQJx-FU&t=450.14s)]
