# Hamas reportedly preventing civilian evacuations in Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM)
*  Israeli forces gathered along the Gaza border as about half the population of the strip [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=0.0s)]
*  is told to leave their homes and head south. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=14.32s)]
*  Right now you are looking at video of leaflets falling from the sky in northern Gaza telling [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=17.080000000000002s)]
*  people to leave now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=22.8s)]
*  Wow, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin also meeting with officials in Israel and we expect him [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=24.04s)]
*  to speak any moment now live from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=28.28s)]
*  But first, Trey Yanks has some breaking news for us from southern Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=30.68s)]
*  Trey, what are you learning? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=34.04s)]
*  Yeah, Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=36.08s)]
*  According to a diplomatic source speaking with Fox News, Hamas, the group in control [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=39.0s)]
*  of Gaza, is preventing civilians from leaving their homes after the Israelis warned them [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=43.92s)]
*  of an impending strike. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  I also spoke with a civilian in Gaza City who confirmed this information and then reached [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=51.36s)]
*  out to Hamas where a senior official told me, quote, it's technically impossible. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=56.2s)]
*  This is a significant development because we do know the Israelis will drop leaflets [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=61.720000000000006s)]
*  and they will do what's called a roof knock strike to warn civilians inside their homes, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=65.48s)]
*  especially high rise buildings, that an air strike is going to come and that they need [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=70.56s)]
*  to get out immediately or they could be killed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=75.06s)]
*  This is significant because the source indicated Hamas is threatening people and preventing [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=77.84s)]
*  them from leaving if they tried to get to a safer location. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=82.4s)]
*  It's also significant amid the backdrop of this new warning by Israel and order for [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=86.02s)]
*  all Gazan civilians in the northern part of the strip to leave immediately. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=90.66s)]
*  They're giving them 24 hours, a big indication that a ground operation is imminent. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=94.74s)]
*  Todd, Carley? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=99.61999999999999s)]
*  But wait, Trey, then all of these Palestinian people will die. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=100.61999999999999s)]
*  Why would that be Hamas' goal? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=104.66s)]
*  Look, there's a parallel information war going on here and it is traditionally one of the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=108.02s)]
*  most difficult parts of this story to cover because there are women and children dying [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=114.58s)]
*  in Gaza in these Israeli airstrikes and that shouldn't be glossed over. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=119.38s)]
*  There are horrific scenes inside Gaza of neighborhoods that are totally flattened and babies that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=123.5s)]
*  have been killed there. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=128.62s)]
*  It's a challenging story to cover following that massacre on Saturday morning because [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=130.54s)]
*  we saw so many innocent Israelis slaughtered and Israeli officials and top military commanders [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=135.52s)]
*  that we've spoken with basically have said, look, we have to get to Hamas, we have to [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=140.7s)]
*  get to our civilians that were kidnapped and there will be collateral damage. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=145.22s)]
*  And this is the collateral damage, the civilian casualties in Gaza and there are just bloody [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=149.72s)]
*  scenes unfolding there. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=155.28s)]
*  So why would Hamas want them not to leave their homes? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=156.78s)]
*  Likely has to do with part of the parallel information war that they are waging against [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=160.14s)]
*  Israel amid this ongoing conflict. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=164.54s)]
*  It's absolutely a PR move at this point and if you had any idea, any question as to what [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=167.74s)]
*  their ultimate motives are, it clearly is willing to sacrifice their people for the [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=172.74s)]
*  PR motives. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=177.5s)]
*  I want to ask you this question though. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=178.78s)]
*  1.1 million people, that's a lot of people to control, if you will, and to say you can't [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=180.42000000000002s)]
*  leave your homes. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=185.18s)]
*  How? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=186.18s)]
*  How are the Hamas terrorists with their numbers basically getting 1.1 million people to not [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=187.18s)]
*  move? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=194.62s)]
*  This seems like a tall order for Hamas. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=195.62s)]
*  How are they doing it? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=197.14000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we don't have any reporting indicating that they're stopping people from moving, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=199.14000000000001s)]
*  but that's certainly a possibility. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=204.94s)]
*  This is specifically when the Israelis warned about it pending strikes. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=207.78s)]
*  In terms of the evacuation order that's supposed to happen over the next 24 hours, you're right, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  it will be incredibly difficult to move 1.1 million people. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=216.9s)]
*  I spoke with someone else in Gaza City this morning who indicated there are thousands [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=220.14000000000001s)]
*  of people heating those orders and starting to move from the northern part of Gaza into [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=225.1s)]
*  Gaza City, but not yet from Gaza City further south. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=228.66s)]
*  So a lot of technical details here in all of this, but it's important to note 24 hours [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=232.26s)]
*  is not enough time to get 1 million civilians out of the way, and that should be noted. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=236.9s)]
*  The Israelis are only giving them 24 hours, and there is really simply nowhere for them [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=242.1s)]
*  to go. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=246.45999999999998s)]
*  Those who do leave will likely walk, they will pick the things that they can grab on [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=247.56s)]
*  their backs with their children and their families, and they will go south. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=251.1s)]
*  The next largest city that is south is Hanunis, but it's very far away. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=254.26s)]
*  There's an area before you get to Hanunis that they may be able to go. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=258.86s)]
*  It's a more rural area of the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=262.34s)]
*  And then the next city further south from there on the Egyptian border is a city called [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=264.7s)]
*  Ra'afa. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=268.5s)]
*  Todd, Carlin? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=269.5s)]
*  All right, well the realities of war are horrific, and they are playing out right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=270.5s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cOZdh7lPsOM&t=274.06s)]
