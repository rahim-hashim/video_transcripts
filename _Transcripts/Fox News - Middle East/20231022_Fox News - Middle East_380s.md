# A deep-dive into the US Marines' arsenal amid war in Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0)
*  The 26th Marine Corps Expeditionary Unit, also referred to as the MU, abruptly ended [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=0.0s)]
*  pre-scheduled training in Kuwait last week and is in route to the waters off of Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=6.44s)]
*  The unit can operate a range of military operations and today we're diving deeper into their arsenal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=11.28s)]
*  You hear things like MU and now we're going to break down a little bit for you what that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=16.88s)]
*  means. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=20.96s)]
*  First of all, Joey, a Marine Expeditionary Unit, how many of them does the U.S. have? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=21.96s)]
*  How long do they train? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  How long are they out? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  They're in rotational cycles. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  So we have several on the East Coast, several on the West Coast, one that's permanently [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=28.8s)]
*  in Okinawa and they go out onto their deployment depending on training schedule and really [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=32.08s)]
*  things like this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=37.88s)]
*  You're doing an 18-month workup for what should be a six-month deployment. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=39.400000000000006s)]
*  I don't know their full schedule. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=43.32s)]
*  There's always a MU in training and always a MU out in the water. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=44.92s)]
*  So 18 to 24 months of training to be out on a boat for six months effectively is a floating [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  emergency response unit full of 2,000 Marines. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=53.92s)]
*  And to set the stage, this is actually what the Marine Corps is supposed to do and does [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=57.08s)]
*  best. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=61.4s)]
*  The Marine Corps has a promise to the President of the United States, within 72 hours, anywhere [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=62.4s)]
*  in the world, we will wage war and take the fight to our enemies. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=65.72s)]
*  Now we may not be able to hold ground, that's what the Army's for. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=68.72s)]
*  They have more of like a 30-day window, bring in the big stuff, build buildings, make outposts, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=71.52s)]
*  things like that. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=78.24s)]
*  The Marine Corps, lightweight, maneuverable, go in, cause havoc, let the Army come in and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=79.24s)]
*  hold the ground. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=83.08s)]
*  That's kind of the traditional role of the Marine Corps. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=84.28s)]
*  And until 2005 when Marsau came to be, when he thought Marine Special Forces, this is [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=86.96s)]
*  kind of how you would implement Marine Special Forces. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=92.32s)]
*  So you say light infantry, but when we break this down, there's a lot of big equipment [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=95.25999999999999s)]
*  that these Marines bring around. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=99.66s)]
*  First of all, in four slides we'll break out what is on a MU. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=100.88s)]
*  First you've got the command element, Joey. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=104.16s)]
*  You're going to have about 150 officers telling everybody what to do. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=105.8s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=109.19999999999999s)]
*  The Marine Corps prides itself on small unit leadership. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  You got 169 people wearing shiny things on their collar, but don't make a mistake about [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=111.63999999999999s)]
*  it. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=116.48s)]
*  It's the sergeants and the corporals who are going to take the teams to combat. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=117.48s)]
*  A couple of lieutenants too. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, we just tell them what to do. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  All right, next slide is the actual ground element, Joey. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=121.36s)]
*  That's 1,200 sailors and Marines. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=125.32s)]
*  Yeah, so when we talk about this, we're going to talk about capabilities. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=127.36s)]
*  This is to get on the ground. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=130.4s)]
*  But what makes the Marine Corps completely different from the Haws, Moths, and Zuma to [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=131.88s)]
*  the Shorts, EEE, or Fighter Nations battle on land, on air, and sea? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=135.44s)]
*  They have the ability to do an amphibious assault. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=139.7s)]
*  That means they can go from the ship onto a beach like that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=142.4s)]
*  They have the capabilities and the vehicles for it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=146.52s)]
*  They also can do it through the air. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=148.36s)]
*  Obviously, they can do an insertion through helicopters. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=149.8s)]
*  We'll talk about what some of these actual vehicles are, but the idea is they can go [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=151.68s)]
*  through the air, through the ocean, and get on land, and go in and do their mission. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=155.0s)]
*  Go in and take somebody on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=158.68s)]
*  You can reinforce someone and provide additional defensive capabilities. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=159.68s)]
*  Stability operations are longer term, which they could end up being involved in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  Small unit, the word is we can hurt you or we can help you, and we can do both really [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=167.4s)]
*  well. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=172.12s)]
*  I like it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=173.12s)]
*  We have a lot of aviation assets, over 400 Marines and sailors that fly some really high [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=174.44s)]
*  tech equipment. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=179.44s)]
*  I know you've watched Top Gun, but some of the best fighter pilots in the military are [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=180.44s)]
*  Marines. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=184.32s)]
*  We have our own fighting aircraft. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=185.32s)]
*  In a MEU, you have various types of aircraft. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  Some of it's changed as of late. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=189.8s)]
*  We have what's called the Harrier. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=191.4s)]
*  It's a fighter jet, basically, that can come up and down vertically. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=192.48000000000002s)]
*  We now have the Osprey that can do that and haul troops. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=195.38s)]
*  So you have a lot of capabilities included in this MAGTF or MEU that can bring troops [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=197.96s)]
*  and firepower into the battlefield. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  All right, we're going to move to the next slide, which is logistics. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  Logistics are very, very important, but we're going to move through it quickly because I [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=208.04s)]
*  want to get to all the capabilities on one slide that exist on a MEU. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  What this really means is they're self-sustainable. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=215.32s)]
*  They can feed themselves, take care of themselves, and pack up their wounds themselves. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=217.48s)]
*  All right, next slide is the entirety of all of the combat power. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=221.72s)]
*  And when you look at this, you say, I mean, we're talking four main battle tanks. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=227.04s)]
*  They've taken tanks out of it now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=232.36s)]
*  This is a change that happened this year. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=234.12s)]
*  That's why we have the expert. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=235.96s)]
*  Well, this is about the lightweight maneuverability of the Marine Corps. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=237.4s)]
*  And the rest of those vehicles kind of talk to that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=241.0s)]
*  I mean, you've got over 100 Humvees. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=243.44s)]
*  You've got light armored vehicles. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=246.84s)]
*  Those are those are like side by sides with armor on them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=248.36s)]
*  Absolutely. And then you talked about this being a place, a power projection platform [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=250.72s)]
*  in the air as well. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=255.56s)]
*  Absolutely. This Osprey is the plane that you've seen videos of that looks like an airplane [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=256.4s)]
*  with propellers. All of a sudden, the propellers go up and they land like a helicopter. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=260.6s)]
*  They can haul a lot of troops on an Osprey and the Super Stallion, the CH-53, if it ain't leaking, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=264.2s)]
*  it ain't working. It's a battle tank in the air and it can take our guys wherever they need to be. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  Hueys to get them out if if something goes wrong. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=274.16s)]
*  And then you have other aircraft, a lot of rotary aircraft. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=277.08s)]
*  All this is about getting people in and getting people out. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=280.08s)]
*  One of the main missions of a Mew would be hostage rescue. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=284.04s)]
*  If a fighter pilot has to eject and goes down behind enemy lines, that type of surgical go in, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=288.16s)]
*  take care of business and get back out mission. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=293.52s)]
*  We bring it over here to the subject matter expert. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=295.96s)]
*  You said the ability to sustain yourself is that's it right here. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=298.28000000000003s)]
*  We've got records. We've got bulldozers, forklifts. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=301.32s)]
*  If we have to sustain and hold an area, we can do it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=303.64s)]
*  But there are 10,000 troops. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=306.4s)]
*  There's 2000 troops that are doing the combat and the rest of this stuff. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=308.0s)]
*  The Marine Corps is the smallest, the smallest service in the military. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=311.8s)]
*  It has the most different jobs because we are so malleable. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=315.52000000000004s)]
*  And this is how you highlight that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=319.04s)]
*  Lastly, just to kind of just to kind of wrap this up, I do want to say this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=320.88s)]
*  They are special operations certified. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  They can go in and get hostages, things like that. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=328.04s)]
*  If we end up with SEALs, Delta Force, things like that, they already are trained to work with them [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=330.20000000000005s)]
*  to be their guardian angels, their infield, their ex-field. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  Whatever the president decides to do here, this is the military capabilities you need to do it [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=338.32s)]
*  without engaging us in a long-sustained, high troop count ground war. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=344.44s)]
*  All of this brought to you by three ships, is my understanding. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=349.0s)]
*  I know for a fact there are three ships in this Mew as published before it took off. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSHP8NA4Og0&t=352.91999999999996s)]
