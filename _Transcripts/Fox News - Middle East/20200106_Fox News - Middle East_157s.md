# Pelosi moves to limit Trump's military power in Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0)
*  The political fight over the Iran strike is intensifying tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=0.0s)]
*  The Speaker of the House says she will try to limit the President's war powers. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=3.8000000000000003s)]
*  He says his Twitter posts are all the notification Congress needs. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Correspondent David Spontes is at the U.S. Supreme Court tonight where that battle could [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=12.120000000000001s)]
*  eventually end up. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=15.68s)]
*  When it comes to war, the Constitution has conflicting messages. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=19.2s)]
*  Article 2, Section 2 states, quote, the President shall be Commander in Chief of the Army and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=23.0s)]
*  Navy of the United States. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=27.619999999999997s)]
*  But the Commander in Chief has limits. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=29.9s)]
*  Article 1, Section 8 says Congress alone has the power, quote, to declare war. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=31.979999999999997s)]
*  As tensions with Iran reach a boiling point, the interpretation of the President's powers [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=39.94s)]
*  is up for debate in a city that relishes the term. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  The President had every authority he needed as Commander in Chief to do it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=47.9s)]
*  It was the right decision because American lives were at stake. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=52.54s)]
*  The President has said, I've got 52 targets. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=56.38s)]
*  I might go after them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=58.7s)]
*  I might do it disproportionately. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=59.7s)]
*  I might go after cultural sites. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=61.14s)]
*  That is war. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=63.34s)]
*  That is not a response to an imminent threat. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=64.34s)]
*  Yesterday, the President put out this tweet announcing his potential plans to strike Iran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=66.46000000000001s)]
*  Quote, such legal notice is not required but is given nevertheless. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=71.58s)]
*  The President's tweet just doesn't make a lot of sense. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=76.22s)]
*  Scott Anderson served under President Obama and was the legal advisor to the U.S. Embassy [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=78.98s)]
*  in Baghdad. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=83.54s)]
*  The Trump administration doesn't appear to have coordinated at all with members of Congress [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  in advance. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=88.14s)]
*  And prior administrations have generally done so to some extent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=89.14s)]
*  But Anderson says the President and his team still have the upper hand in many situations. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  The executive branch has a huge amount of discretion practically in how it interprets [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=97.34s)]
*  both its own constitutional authority and statutes that Congress might pass to give [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=102.42s)]
*  it additional authority to use military force. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=107.7s)]
*  December 7, 1941. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=110.02s)]
*  World War II marks the last time Congress officially declared war. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=114.58s)]
*  In 1973, Congress passed the War Powers Resolution, which requires the President to notify Congress [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=118.86s)]
*  within 48 hours of sending troops into hostile territory. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  Following the 9-11 attacks, Congress passed the Authorization for Use of Military Force, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=128.85999999999999s)]
*  giving the President broad authority in specific cases. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  The AUMF, as it's known, has been used 41 times in 18 countries. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=137.1s)]
*  Supreme Court has never ruled directly on the President's war powers before. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=142.34s)]
*  Legal experts say that is by design to keep justices out of the fight. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=146.18s)]
*  But hey, Brett, it's the Supreme Court. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=149.94s)]
*  Anything could happen behind me. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=151.9s)]
*  David Spahn, live outside the Supreme Court. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=153.26s)]
*  David, thank you. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pBPn6ofC-k0&t=155.85999999999999s)]
