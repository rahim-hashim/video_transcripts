# Thousands expected to gather at National Mall for pro-Israel rally
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc)
*  Back here at home, thousands of pro-Israel demonstrators [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=0.0s)]
*  are expected to gather at the National Mall in Washington, DC [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=3.48s)]
*  for today's March for Israel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=7.08s)]
*  And also in DC, college students will testify today [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=8.92s)]
*  to House lawmakers about how to confront anti-Semitism [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=12.68s)]
*  on college campuses after numerous reports of harassment [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=16.32s)]
*  and violence from pro-Palestinian supporters. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=19.68s)]
*  Sahar Tartak is a student at Yale [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=23.32s)]
*  and will testify at that hearing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  She's also going to be attending the March for Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=27.6s)]
*  that will take place on the National Mall later today. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=32.84s)]
*  Sahar, good morning to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=34.84s)]
*  What a day. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=36.36s)]
*  Two very meaningful events that you are taking part in. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  So what is your message this morning [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=40.72s)]
*  ahead of your testimony on Capitol Hill later today? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=43.0s)]
*  Sure, thank you so much for having me this morning. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  So what I'm going to tell our representatives [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=49.88s)]
*  is that for the past month and a week now, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=52.76s)]
*  I and my peers have had no time or opportunity [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=58.56s)]
*  to mourn the loss of our 1,400 plus relatives across the sea [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=62.879999999999995s)]
*  because we have been too busy handling [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=67.96s)]
*  various anti-Jewish events of hatred [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=69.92s)]
*  and the universities have failed to protect us [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=74.28s)]
*  and that representatives have an opportunity [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=77.8s)]
*  to penalize them. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=80.4s)]
*  Yeah, I understand that you wrote an article. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=83.28s)]
*  The article is titled, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=85.8s)]
*  Is Yalees for Palestine a Hate Group? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=86.64s)]
*  And two weeks later, it received an editor's note [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=89.12s)]
*  that said this column has been edited [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=91.8s)]
*  to remove unsubstantiated claims [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=93.64s)]
*  that Hamas raped women and beheaded men. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=96.12s)]
*  They called those claims unsubstantiated, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=98.8s)]
*  edited your column as a result of this decision. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=101.24s)]
*  What went through your head [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=104.36s)]
*  when you saw that editor's note? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=105.84s)]
*  To be honest, there's just no shock anymore. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=107.44s)]
*  I mean, I get back to school [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=110.44s)]
*  and my peers are shouting resistance justified [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=112.28s)]
*  by the hundreds in multiple anti-Israel, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  pro-Hamas student rallies. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=118.92s)]
*  And so I see something like this and I say, okay, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=121.52s)]
*  so they're no longer justifying Hamas's brutalities. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=123.8s)]
*  They're just denying them outright. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=126.72s)]
*  And how can I be surprised? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=128.76s)]
*  University has done nothing to stop them. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=130.44s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, the fact that they're not doing anything [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=133.76s)]
*  Yeah, and you know, these claims were substantiated [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=136.68s)]
*  by members of Hamas themselves [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=139.12s)]
*  when they recorded these heinous and barbaric actions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=140.96s)]
*  So there is horrific proof out there [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=144.4s)]
*  that shows that these things did take place. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=146.6s)]
*  This March for Israel Today, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  it's expected to be quite an event. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=150.28s)]
*  Organizers expect 100,000 people [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  to attend all the national mall. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=154.0s)]
*  What do you hope is achieved by this? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=156.24s)]
*  I really hope that our lawmakers are able to see [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=161.92s)]
*  that this issue is important to the Jewish community [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  in a way unlike Israel issues have been in the past. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=170.51999999999998s)]
*  This has become now so black and white. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  This has become such a question of life and death [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=177.0s)]
*  for Jewish people, both in America, in the United States, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=179.32s)]
*  on our college campuses and across the sea in Israel, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=183.28s)]
*  that if they mess this up, the stakes are high. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=186.56s)]
*  Yeah, and it's important also to really strengthen [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=191.0s)]
*  the president's resolve and show him that despite [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=194.44s)]
*  what some progressive Congress women might say, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=197.68s)]
*  that a majority of the American people do stand with him [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=200.28s)]
*  through his support for Israel. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=205.16s)]
*  So at the same time as that's happening, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=206.84s)]
*  there have been many pro-Palestinian, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=209.04s)]
*  at times pro-Hamas protests. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=211.52s)]
*  Are you surprised at that level of people, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=214.48s)]
*  that the volume of people in this country [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=217.24s)]
*  that would outright support a designated hate group, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=219.92s)]
*  terrorist organization? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=224.48s)]
*  To be honest, unfortunately, I'm not surprised at all. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=228.27999999999997s)]
*  Listen, in the 1930s, thousands of Americans showed up [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=230.88s)]
*  to pro-Nazi rallies, and I view this as no different. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  And it's fascinating because these are often found [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=240.11999999999998s)]
*  in the pockets of really elite academia, right? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=243.72s)]
*  Yale, Harvard, Cornell, and being an academic elite [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=247.72s)]
*  seems to not stop anybody from being supportive [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=253.36s)]
*  of a terrorist organization. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=256.16s)]
*  It might even propel you to that opinion. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=257.72s)]
*  Yeah, we will be speaking out later on Capitol Hill [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=260.32s)]
*  and then marching in this march for Israel. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=262.36s)]
*  It's taking place on the National Mall, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=264.68s)]
*  one to three p.m. Eastern time. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=266.12s)]
*  So if you're in the area or wanna travel, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=268.04s)]
*  I'm sure that everybody would welcome the support. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=270.32s)]
*  So, Hartar Tech, thank you so much for joining us [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=273.12s)]
*  on this busy day for you. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=275.04s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=275.88s)]
*  Great day, absolutely. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dXvtYzWoVCc&t=276.72s)]
