# Iranians apprehended at southern border
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA)
*  We are back with a Fox News alert. FBI Director Christopher Wray is now warning Americans [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=0.0s)]
*  to stay vigilant for possible terror threats here at home. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=5.92s)]
*  So Ainsley, Wray fears that Hamas copycat attacks could happen on U.S. soil. Meanwhile, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  national security concerns rise at our southern border. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=15.56s)]
*  That's because our border patrol agents have announced that four Iranians here illegally [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=19.12s)]
*  have been apprehended in Texas just in the last month. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=24.32s)]
*  Alexandria Hoff is live at the White House with more. Alex. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=28.2s)]
*  Hey guys, I'm here in the Washington Bureau right now. I actually, I want to comment because [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=31.08s)]
*  you guys were talking to Trey about the idea of Hamas being an ideology and you don't have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=35.32s)]
*  to train with Hamas terrorists to think like them. That's the message coming out from the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=40.28s)]
*  FBI is that we should not discount the possibility that Hamas or other terrorist organizations [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=43.84s)]
*  will take advantage of the current conflict by calling on supporters to carry out an attack [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  here in the United States. The Bureau's biggest concern is a solo assailant. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=52.96s)]
*  We've got to be on the lookout, especially for loan actors who may take inspiration from [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=58.279999999999994s)]
*  recent events to commit violence of their own. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=64.64s)]
*  And this, of course, has sparked increased concern over the flow of migrants at our [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=68.88s)]
*  southern border. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, four Iranians have [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=71.96s)]
*  been apprehended since the beginning of this month. That is four. They're all considered [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=76.56s)]
*  to be special interest aliens. That's a term used to describe individuals coming from [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=80.52s)]
*  countries identified by the U.S. government as having conditions that promote or protect [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=84.52s)]
*  terrorism. Individuals may also have some suspicious travel patterns. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=88.92s)]
*  And look at this. In the first 14 days of this fiscal year, over 30 Iranians were [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=92.32s)]
*  apprehended at the southern border, nearly 60 Syrians, 35 Pakistanis, more than 100 [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=97.92s)]
*  Russians, 285 Afghans and nearly 2000 Chinese migrants. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=103.44s)]
*  Over the past two years, U.S. Border Patrol has encountered almost 73,000 special [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=108.92s)]
*  interest aliens, many of them from Middle Eastern countries. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=114.08s)]
*  And just last week, CBP agents apprehended two Lebanese nationals in Eagle Pass, Texas. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=117.36s)]
*  They were also considered to be special interest aliens. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=122.92s)]
*  Lebanon, of course, home to Hezbollah. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=125.72s)]
*  Guys, that's so scary. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. And there are these there are these two lawmakers, two congressmen in Washington. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=130.0s)]
*  They're trying to pass that legislation so that we don't allow anyone from from Gaza, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=134.04s)]
*  any of the Palestinian authorities to enter into our country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=138.6s)]
*  Where does that stand? Do you know? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=142.12s)]
*  The Gaza Act. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=143.48s)]
*  Yeah, you know, that's interesting. We were reading about that a little bit when I was at [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=145.44s)]
*  the White House yesterday. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=148.2s)]
*  It's certainly getting some pushback from people because the idea is you have these [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=149.64s)]
*  special interest aliens, as we were just talking about. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=153.04s)]
*  Not all of them are people who adhere to the same beliefs as their government. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=156.04s)]
*  Many are seeking refugee, you know, refuge in the United States, wanting to distance [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=160.44s)]
*  themselves. So it's going to get a lot of pushback, but it's making waves because people [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=164.88s)]
*  in the United States are scared. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=168.88s)]
*  Yeah. Alex, thanks so much. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=170.16s)]
*  Appreciate it. And we're Ron DeSantis is leading the charge on that among the candidates. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=172.0s)]
*  And one of his points is, look, they might not all be Hamas, but they're anti-Semitic. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=176.28s)]
*  We don't know who they are. This is not the point. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=180.64000000000001s)]
*  This is not the time now to take any chances. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=182.44s)]
*  I think it's a little bit different with Afghanistan. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=184.76000000000002s)]
*  We were there for 20 years and you have all these you have all these allies, but you all [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=186.60000000000002s)]
*  these examples of them showing loyalty in the past, whether they were interpreters, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=192.20000000000002s)]
*  whether they actually fought with us, the type of positions they had with the government [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=197.72s)]
*  it was ousted because we left. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=201.08s)]
*  But that's a lot different than now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  I'm with them on the run to Santa's camp. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=204.36s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCa7lqcL7aA&t=207.16000000000003s)]
