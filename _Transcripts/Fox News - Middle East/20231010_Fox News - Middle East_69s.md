# White House refuses to answer if Biden will refreeze $6B in Iranian funds
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY)
*  Yeah. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=0.0s)]
*  Thank you, Jake. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=0.5s)]
*  You just laid out all of the ways [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=1.0s)]
*  that Iran is complicit in this and facilitated it [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=2.92s)]
*  over years of support for Hamas. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=6.96s)]
*  Is that reason enough to freeze, refreeze the $6 billion [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=9.620000000000001s)]
*  that the US helped unlock for them to get [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=13.8s)]
*  in exchange for the prisoners? [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=16.16s)]
*  We have not yet had $1 of that $6 billion spent, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=18.0s)]
*  and I will leave it at that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=23.44s)]
*  But will you refreeze it based on this activity [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=24.52s)]
*  that you just laid out all of the ways [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=27.4s)]
*  that they are complicit in this? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=29.68s)]
*  The administration said that if we [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  see them going in the wrong direction, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=33.44s)]
*  that we would stop that down. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=35.0s)]
*  I understand the position that you guys have, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=37.0s)]
*  that not a dollar of this has been spent. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=39.28s)]
*  But will you prevent it from getting into their hands [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=41.48s)]
*  to allow them to do what they do that you just laid out? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=43.879999999999995s)]
*  Let me just reiterate what I said, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=48.959999999999994s)]
*  because it's unequivocal. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=50.64s)]
*  Not a dollar of that money has been spent, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=52.68s)]
*  and I will leave it at that. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=54.96s)]
*  Is it being considered? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0-4bOsSdxmY&t=56.12s)]
