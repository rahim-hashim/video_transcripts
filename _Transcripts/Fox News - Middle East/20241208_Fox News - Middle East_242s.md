# 'WICKEDLY COMPLEX': Syrian rebels' takeover poses key risks to national security
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20)
*  For more on the situation in Syria, let's bring in former CIA station chief and Fox News contributor Dan Hoffman. Dan, welcome. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks. Good to see you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=7.0s)]
*  President-elect Trump writing on True Social about the situation in Syria, quote, the United States should have nothing to do with it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=10.0s)]
*  This is not our fight. Let it play out. Do not get involved. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=16.0s)]
*  What, in your view, should the U.S. do about Syria? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=20.0s)]
*  Well, I think we do have our national security at stake there. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=24.0s)]
*  Look, this most sizable portion of that Syrian opposition is made up of terrorists, Hayek Tahrir al-Sham. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=29.0s)]
*  And we have to be concerned about ISIS in Syria, as well as Syria's chemical weapons stockpile. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=36.0s)]
*  So a mix of terrorists and a chemical weapons stockpile is, of course, of grave concern to us and our allies in the region. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=42.0s)]
*  We also have to be concerned about spillover into Jordan and Israel, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=50.0s)]
*  and also the potential that more fighting will ensue, that this is just the beginning of a follow-on civil war. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=55.0s)]
*  I think the question is, where do we go from here? And that's, at this point, unanswered. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=63.0s)]
*  High priorities for our intelligence community, for sure. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=68.0s)]
*  A former U.S. Central Command commander weighed in earlier today on ABC Let's Play Him. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=71.0s)]
*  Our interest in Syria is probably preventing violent extremist groups from being able to plan and execute attacks against our homeland [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=77.0s)]
*  and the homeland of our friends and partners abroad. I agree with them. It's a mess. They're no friend of ours. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=86.0s)]
*  They've never been a friend of ours. But we have interests. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=91.0s)]
*  Is General McKenzie correct, sir? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=94.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think he's absolutely right. That's our key national security interest. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=97.0s)]
*  And the concern I think that we would have going forward is the potential for a power vacuum here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=101.0s)]
*  We saw this in Iraq and in Libya, and terrorists take advantage of that. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=106.0s)]
*  And the concern I think we have is that potentially terrorists may be flocking to Syria right now, seeking to take advantage of just that. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=110.0s)]
*  We also have a real challenge there, because state actors like Russia and Iran, formerly allied with Syria— [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=117.0s)]
*  remember, Russia has a naval base in Tartus—they are not going to be on the side of solving this problem with us. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=124.0s)]
*  We've got real challenges with them as well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=131.0s)]
*  And so gaining some kind of international consensus on the way forward is also a major challenge. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=134.0s)]
*  This is yet another wickedly complex challenge and threat to our national security that's going to be left for the incoming Trump administration. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=139.0s)]
*  I want to remind our audience we're waiting on President Biden to speak at the White House in a matter of minutes about the situation in Syria as we await the commander-in-chief. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=149.0s)]
*  Here is his national security adviser on this issue. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=158.0s)]
*  We really think that there are three things we have to be particularly focused on. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=162.0s)]
*  One, that the fighting in Syria not lead to the resurgence of ISIS. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=166.0s)]
*  And we are going to take steps ourselves directly and working with the Syrian Democratic Forces, the Kurds, to ensure that does not happen. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=170.0s)]
*  How do you assess that, Dan? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=177.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think, look, we have a very small footprint right now in Syria, less than a thousand military there right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=180.0s)]
*  But we need to have that finished capability and we need the intelligence to find and fix those terrorist targets to protect ourselves, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=188.0s)]
*  to preempt those threats before they're visited on our allies and our homeland. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=195.0s)]
*  And I think that is definitely a key for our national security. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=199.0s)]
*  And again, I would just emphasize the chemical weapons in Syria as well as Syria's Cap-to-Gone production. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=203.0s)]
*  They've been shipping this illegal drug, amphetamine, all over Europe and the region. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=210.0s)]
*  And if terrorists gain control of the production of that drug, that's also another concern for us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=215.0s)]
*  We need to work with our allies in the region and we need to have our own unilateral capability to take care of our own security. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=220.0s)]
*  Dan Hoffman, thanks so much for your time and analysis today. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-IgGfrgt20&t=227.0s)]
