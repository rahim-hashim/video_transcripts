# Former State Dept. spox warns this is the 'biggest failure' of Middle East policy in 20 years
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE)
*  More on the US airstrikes against the Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=0.0s)]
*  Joining us live now, former State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortegas. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=3.68s)]
*  Morgan, I want to get your reaction. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=8.16s)]
*  You heard in Lucas's great reporting there, General Jack Keane, Fox News contributor, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=10.24s)]
*  saying that ultimately, unless they go after, the administration goes after Iran, no deterrence [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  is going to stop these Iran-backed proxies like the Houthis. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=21.88s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=25.68s)]
*  I think General Keane is right. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=28.159999999999997s)]
*  Let's just fast forward or go back, I should say reverse, to three years ago when we, what [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=30.159999999999997s)]
*  we handed over the Trump administration to the Biden administration. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=35.239999999999995s)]
*  Iran was essentially in a box. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=39.16s)]
*  We had taken out Qasem Soleimani, the head of the IRGC. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=40.66s)]
*  The Quds Force were essentially, you know, combined to their, or confined to their barracks [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=44.28s)]
*  for a year. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=48.28s)]
*  And so they weren't operating as they are now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=49.959999999999994s)]
*  They didn't have the billions of dollars that they have had over the past three years [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=52.64s)]
*  because of sanctions that the Biden administration hasn't pursued. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  We were heavy every day doing a maximum economic pressure campaign against the Islamic [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  Republic of Iran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=65.36s)]
*  And so what you have seen is just probably the biggest failure of Middle East policy [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=67.88s)]
*  in 20 years has been Biden's policy towards the Iranian regime because they were in a [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=73.8s)]
*  box, they had maximum pressure, they had max leverage, and that has been squandered [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=79.24000000000001s)]
*  over the past three years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=84.4s)]
*  And another point, by the way, on the Houthis, we see these attacks that the U.S. had to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=87.2s)]
*  do in Yemen. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=90.04s)]
*  That's another failure of Biden and U.S. policy. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=91.04s)]
*  What happened three years ago in February of 21, right after Biden took over, he stopped [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=94.52000000000001s)]
*  the Saudis and said basically you cannot continue with the war on your own peninsula, right? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  We told them no more weapons from the United States for that war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=105.08000000000001s)]
*  We told them that the war had to end. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=108.4s)]
*  What happened? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  The Houthis spent three years, instead of the Saudis continuing to go after them and [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  do the work for us and go after the terrorists for us, the Biden administration spent the [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=115.64s)]
*  last three years letting the Houthis build up their capabilities. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=121.32s)]
*  And now you have a nightmare scenario, Griff. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=125.16s)]
*  This is the scenario that we talked extensively about in the days and months after 9-11. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=127.48s)]
*  We said that we were worried that sophisticated weaponry would get in the hands of a terrorist [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=132.48s)]
*  group, and that is exactly what happened. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=136.96s)]
*  We have a terrorist group shooting ballistic missiles at our troops. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=138.64s)]
*  Morgan, I want to go back just because, you know, people forget that you guys, towards [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=141.88s)]
*  the end of the Trump administration, listed the Houthis as a terrorist organization. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=146.32s)]
*  When Trump came, or Biden came in, in February 4th of 2021, one of the first things he did [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=151.32s)]
*  is delist the Houthis from the terror list. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Yesterday, Biden was asked about whether or not the Houthis are terrorists or not. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=160.44s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=164.51999999999998s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=165.51999999999998s)]
*  Are we in the back of the process? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=167.28s)]
*  No. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=168.76000000000002s)]
*  Iran does not want to award us. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  Are you worried that these are terrorist groups, sir? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  I think they are. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=175.76000000000002s)]
*  I think they are, he says. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=177.4s)]
*  So he thinks the Houthis are terrorists, but yet his administration doesn't list them. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=178.72s)]
*  Does this matter? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=183.72s)]
*  It does matter because, first of all, it took us about a year to build that designation [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  package and it matters because when they lifted the terrorism designation from the Houthis, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=190.20000000000002s)]
*  guess what the Houthis did? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=196.56s)]
*  Within two days, they were attacking again. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=197.56s)]
*  And so it's this, I think it's Griff, like this liberal, high-minded sort of view of [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=200.76s)]
*  the world. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=206.56s)]
*  They didn't like how many civilian casualties were happening when the Saudis were going [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=207.56s)]
*  after the Houthis. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=211.56s)]
*  I get that, I respect that. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=212.56s)]
*  What we should have done is worked with the Saudis to refine their targeting capability, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=214.26s)]
*  to refine what they were doing, their attacks on the Houthis, and instead, we just said, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=218.44s)]
*  no, no, no, stop the war, too many civilian attacks. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=223.68s)]
*  Does that sound similar? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  Sounds like variations on a theme. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=227.79999999999998s)]
*  And what happens when you make people stop the war and stop going after the terrorists? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  It just means we get dragged into it and we have to do it ourselves. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=232.39999999999998s)]
*  So we're now three years later doing something that the Saudis, that we stopped the Saudis [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=236.29999999999998s)]
*  from doing, and now we're using our own Tomahawk missiles, our own resources, which should [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=240.51999999999998s)]
*  be in the Indo-Pacific and focused on China and Taiwan. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=245.7s)]
*  Well, and one of the things that the Saudis will appreciate is right now our producers [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=248.56s)]
*  will show you Abdul Malik al-Houthi. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=253.06s)]
*  He is the leader of this organization that has for years been building this very strongly [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=256.0s)]
*  armed arsenal of these fighters. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=264.66s)]
*  There he is, there he is in his 40s. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=267.38s)]
*  He's been at this for years. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=268.94s)]
*  In 2022, he really went after Saudi Arabia and the UAE, and now it looks like he's coming [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=269.94s)]
*  for us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=275.38s)]
*  Is it time for the U.S. to target this guy? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=276.38s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, we should be targeting all of Houthi senior leadership. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=278.94s)]
*  Absolutely, that's a given. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=284.09999999999997s)]
*  We're still waiting for the battle damage assessment. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=285.9s)]
*  But as Senator Risch, for example, said, put out in his statement, the series of strikes [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=287.94s)]
*  I'm supportive of over the past few days, but it can't be a one and done thing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=292.29999999999995s)]
*  It can't be a narrow response. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=296.78s)]
*  This administration has to restore deterrence. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=299.21999999999997s)]
*  And I'm incredibly concerned about how dangerous the world is under Joe Biden. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=302.02s)]
*  I mean, if you think about it, Griff, every single year of the Biden presidency, there [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=306.17999999999995s)]
*  has been a new war or a new catastrophe. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=311.42s)]
*  In 2021, you saw Kabul fall to the Taliban. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=313.42s)]
*  You now have ISIS, Khorasan with a foothold in every province in Afghanistan. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=317.82s)]
*  In 2022, you see Russia invade Ukraine, the worst war on Europe's soil. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=322.38s)]
*  2023, you see now war has broken out in the Middle East with Hamas killing more Jews than [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=326.98s)]
*  any day since the Holocaust. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=331.86s)]
*  What is 2024 going to bring us? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=333.78s)]
*  I mean, a major war in every single year of the Biden administration. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=335.02s)]
*  Well, we see other problems rising in the South China Sea. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=339.1s)]
*  I want to before I run out of time, I've only got about 30 seconds, but I want to get your [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=342.58s)]
*  reaction to the news today. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=346.14s)]
*  We've got Taiwan's elections are in the independent party, the candidate that Xi Jinping and the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=347.46s)]
*  Communist Party of China did not want to win. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=353.38s)]
*  Alai Shintai has won. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=356.26s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=358.62s)]
*  Yeah, well, first of all, the producers need to give us another 10 minutes to talk about [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=361.02s)]
*  Taiwan. But bottom line, thank God that the DPP won again. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=364.22s)]
*  That means that the Taiwanese people are rejecting all of the coercive attempts by China to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=368.41999999999996s)]
*  interfere in their election. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=374.26s)]
*  China has made it clear, Xi Jinping has made it clear, that reunifying with Taiwan is [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=376.5s)]
*  existential to him, to what he wants to do with China. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  If that happens, you're going to have major, major problems in shipping lanes there. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=385.7s)]
*  You know, we could go into everything that will happen, but you will have China basically [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=391.14s)]
*  eating another democracy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=394.41999999999996s)]
*  We can't allow that to happen. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=396.82s)]
*  And I think Senator Graham's idea to start getting sanctions, to put pre-invasion [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=398.46s)]
*  sanctions on China, if they even consider invading Taiwan, is a number of diplomatic [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=403.97999999999996s)]
*  options that we should be looking at, including military options to deter Xi Jinping from [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3GIwaiV5WbE&t=408.9s)]
