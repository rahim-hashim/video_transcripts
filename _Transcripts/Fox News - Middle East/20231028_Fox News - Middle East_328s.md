# 'VERY RANDOM': Tomi Lahren questions Hamas' intentions behind release of some hostages
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert just hours ago residents were forced to cover as air [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=0.0s)]
*  raid sirens blared over the city from an incoming rocket attack. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=6.28s)]
*  Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the families of people being held [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=11.56s)]
*  hostage by Hamas just before he held his first press conference since the war began. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=15.72s)]
*  Alex Hogan is live with the details on that. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=22.04s)]
*  Alex. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  So this was the first press conference where Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=27.56s)]
*  faced some questions from the press since the October 7th attack. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=32.28s)]
*  And he said this really is a second stage in the war and it is two prong saying that [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  one goal of course is to dismantle Hamas militarily. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=41.48s)]
*  The second being bringing those hostages home. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=45.16s)]
*  This is our second independence war. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=51.12s)]
*  We are fighting on defending our homeland. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=54.08s)]
*  We will fight and not retreat. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=57.16s)]
*  We will destroy the enemy of the land and under. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=59.36s)]
*  This press conference came under it came to be after demonstrations here in the city that [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=64.56s)]
*  you can see right here. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=69.36s)]
*  Families of the more than 200 people who have been taken hostage. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=71.0s)]
*  The prime minister held this last minute meeting where he met with some of these families at [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=75.08s)]
*  least one representative from a lot of these families families promising that they would [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=79.16s)]
*  have otherwise held an even larger protest tonight saying that a lot of them simply have [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  had no answers at all and they want some of those questions answered from the government. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=90.0s)]
*  No one is talking to us. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=96.04s)]
*  We want answers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=97.04s)]
*  We want to ask questions. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=98.04s)]
*  The government. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=99.04s)]
*  We are afraid for our hostages, our family. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=100.04s)]
*  We want to bring them home alive. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=103.04s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Force released this footage, the latest on the widening operation moving [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=109.08s)]
*  into the Gaza Strip with tanks striking buildings and at the same time these massive strikes [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=114.2s)]
*  are also taking place both by land and by sea. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=118.76s)]
*  Netanyahu spoke tonight reiterating his message that we have heard in recent days that this [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  will be a very long war and Israeli forces tonight are again urging Palestinians to leave [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=127.2s)]
*  the north and head further south where they will find more safety. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=133.48000000000002s)]
*  The UN as well as other aid organizations have been reiterating just how desperate and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=137.32s)]
*  dire it is for people who have remained. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=143.16s)]
*  Conditions there have only been made worse by these communication blockouts. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=146.0s)]
*  Now back here in Tel Aviv we have seen sirens throughout the day with again Israeli officials [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=150.52s)]
*  urging everyone to get to shelters as quickly as possible. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=154.96s)]
*  Where we are in Tel Aviv you have about a minute and a half to safely get to shelter [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=158.24s)]
*  but in a lot of these small towns around the country it is much less than that and we are [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=162.32s)]
*  continuing to see many of these strikes on civilian infrastructure. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=167.16s)]
*  Guys. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=170.8s)]
*  Alex thank you so much. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=171.84s)]
*  You know Charlie it is one thing to be told to go south but Hamas is evidently not allowing [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=173.36s)]
*  people to go south. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=178.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah and of course also you know the fact that you know that interview with the hostages [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=179.60000000000002s)]
*  the families of the hostages is a reminder that while you know the attack happened on [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=184.72s)]
*  October 6th for all those families the attack is ongoing every single day. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=188.12s)]
*  Their loved ones are not with them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=192.76000000000002s)]
*  This is not an attack that was just over after that day and also you know I think it is important [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=194.8s)]
*  to remember that you know obviously it has been three weeks now and Israel is only now [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=200.67999999999998s)]
*  starting to move in and I think that there is probably a lot of wisdom in the fact that [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=206.27999999999997s)]
*  they are trying to figure out how to do something very very complicated and to do it with the [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=210.32s)]
*  minimal amount of loss of life. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=216.2s)]
*  Molly. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=218.48s)]
*  Of four hostages released I was just reading this quote this is out of the Israel Times [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=219.48s)]
*  that Melki Shumtoff father one of the captives talks about we are very worried about our [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=223.44s)]
*  loved ones who are there and we don't know if the military operations will take those [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=228.44s)]
*  hostages into consideration that no one will be injured these families clearly trying to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=231.72s)]
*  put a lot of pressure and to make their voices heard on the government on Israel as Israel [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=236.32s)]
*  decides what it's going to do what its next move will be. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=240.64s)]
*  And speaking of these hostages and the ones that have been released it just feels so random [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=243.4s)]
*  and I don't think we've gotten any clarity as to why some have been released and others [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=248.32s)]
*  have not. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=252.0s)]
*  The two women and then a couple of elderly folks being released it just feels very random [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=253.0s)]
*  I don't feel like there's a rhyme or reason to it I'd be really curious to know if there [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=257.76s)]
*  is one or if anybody's been given any indication. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=261.8s)]
*  But for these people that have their families still in a hostage situation by terrorists [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=265.0s)]
*  who value no life I can't imagine what that's like. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=269.2s)]
*  I think it's also important when we're having these tense discussions with two very distinct [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=272.32s)]
*  sides here is that one side does not value life as I just said and another side has been [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=276.68s)]
*  going out of their way to value the life of civilians and that is Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=281.88s)]
*  So I think that's important to note especially when there's so much controversy around the [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=286.48s)]
*  world surrounding a very delicate issue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=290.44s)]
*  Yeah and to that point Tommy you you you have a history with Hamas who have used human shields [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=292.8s)]
*  the whole time. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=299.96s)]
*  There's a reason why they don't want them to go south. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=300.96s)]
*  They reason reason why they they build under a hospital their operational headquarters [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=302.64s)]
*  and everybody wants to break. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=308.32s)]
*  And let's remember there are Americans that are also being held hostage to this point [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=309.88s)]
*  too. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=313.8s)]
*  So it continues on. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=314.8s)]
*  Hey Sean Hannity here. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhdoJKCA3Lk&t=315.84000000000003s)]
