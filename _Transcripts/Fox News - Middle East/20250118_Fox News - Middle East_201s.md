# Palestinian Authority not the solution for Gaza: Foreign policy expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU)
*  Welcome back with this Fox News alert. Phase one of Israel and Hamas's ceasefire deal will begin tomorrow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=0.0s)]
*  After the full Israeli cabinet approved the agreement. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=7.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, Hamas is expected to release the first three of 33 hostages. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=10.0s)]
*  It will free over the span of six weeks. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=16.0s)]
*  The US's lead negotiators say Trump's incoming Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, was critical to getting the job done. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=19.0s)]
*  Steve and I developed a very close partnership, even friendship. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=27.0s)]
*  And at the time to close the deal, I was very grateful that Steve came out to Doha in these last few days, speaking on behalf of President Trump. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=32.0s)]
*  I'm speaking on behalf of President Biden to actually close this deal and get it done. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=42.0s)]
*  Joining us now is former Trump deputy national security adviser, Victoria Coats. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=46.0s)]
*  Victoria, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=51.0s)]
*  I can't help but remember just a few, it seems like hours ago, President Biden was being questioned on who gets credit for this or did President Trump and his administration have a role in it? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=52.0s)]
*  And he really literally scoffed at it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=62.0s)]
*  I think this goes to show you that this isn't happening right now instead of six months ago by accident. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=65.0s)]
*  No, not at all. Good morning, Joey. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=72.0s)]
*  Good morning, Joey. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=74.0s)]
*  This is happening because President Trump, shortly after he was reelected, showed moral clarity on the hostage issue, actually demanded the return of the hostages in early December. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=75.0s)]
*  I was actually in Jerusalem when that happened, and it was like a breath of fresh air. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=87.0s)]
*  The hostage families were so relieved that finally there was American leadership that put the blame right squarely where it belongs on Hamas, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=91.0s)]
*  should have taken them in the first place and has been treating them horrifically now for 15 months. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=99.0s)]
*  And so this is entirely due to President Trump's intervention. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=104.0s)]
*  So I was reading something this morning that the headline was Palestinian authority says it's prepared or ready to take responsibility of Gaza. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=108.0s)]
*  So from what I understand, this is a group that was essentially pushed out by Hamas in the early 2000s. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=118.0s)]
*  So I guess my question is, is there a situation where this Palestinian authority is more friendly to Israel, a better actor, or is it just another name for the same bad people? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=125.0s)]
*  Well, I might re-characterize that as less hostile maybe than Hamas, but that's not saying much. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=135.0s)]
*  And the Palestinian authority has been in control of the West Bank now. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=143.0s)]
*  I believe President Abbas is going on the 21st year of his first four-year term, just not having elections, just kind of ruling over West Bank. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=147.0s)]
*  And you're absolutely correct. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=156.0s)]
*  When the Palestinians in Gaza were given the opportunity to vote in 2006, they voted for Hamas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=158.0s)]
*  And polling shows that they would do the same again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=164.0s)]
*  So I don't know what the solution is, the political solution for Gaza. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=167.0s)]
*  That's something for Israel to work out ideally with our Arab allies in the region. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=170.0s)]
*  But it's certainly not the Palestinian authority. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=175.0s)]
*  Well, we all hope and pray for peace, but Israel obviously has to secure their own country. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=178.0s)]
*  They have to have the ability to live in peace when it's Hamas that wants to kill them. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=184.0s)]
*  Victoria, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jGMyLYWgIUU&t=189.0s)]
