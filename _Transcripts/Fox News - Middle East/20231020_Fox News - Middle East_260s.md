# US shoots down missiles from Iranian proxies
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4)
*  A U.S. Navy warship overnight has shot down three missiles to be believed to be targeting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=7.8s)]
*  Those missiles were fired by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels out of Yemen. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=8.8s)]
*  They've hijacked the government there, essentially. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=12.24s)]
*  Iran has repeatedly warned Israel could face more and more deadly attacks over the coming [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  days. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=20.12s)]
*  The Pentagon is laser-focused on trying to deter Iran from entering this conflict on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=21.12s)]
*  the ground directly. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=25.76s)]
*  We're going to bring in Colonel Daniel Davis. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=27.48s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=29.040000000000003s)]
*  Colonel, so the U.S. shot down these missiles believed to be targeting Israel by Houthi [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  rebels in Yemen. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=37.160000000000004s)]
*  How significant is that? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  Well, it's significant because they were fired at all. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=41.2s)]
*  That means that they have the capacity to fire. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Those were cruise missiles with about 2,000 miles of range on them, and they were shot [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  down. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=50.92s)]
*  We don't know for sure where they were going, but it was possible that they could have been [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=51.92s)]
*  going into targets in Israel. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=54.14s)]
*  So it's good that we shot those down because the last thing we need is for this war to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=56.6s)]
*  expand. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=60.160000000000004s)]
*  And I think that's one of the biggest issues. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  The biggest thing that the administration has is to make sure this stays contained in [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=62.86s)]
*  Gaza and does not expand out where it could potentially cause America to have to go to [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=66.56s)]
*  war. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=70.88s)]
*  And that's what we need to focus on. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=71.88s)]
*  Well, and we've talked a lot about to the north, too, Hezbollah and the incursions that [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=72.88s)]
*  are getting involved now with Lebanon. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=76.12s)]
*  And that is a completely different beast, equipped in a different way. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=78.4s)]
*  That's another front that Israel or the rest of the freedom-loving world doesn't need to [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=82.32s)]
*  see open either. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=85.68s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=86.68s)]
*  That probably is the key to whether this thing expands or not is does Hezbollah come in? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=87.68s)]
*  They have said that their plan is to engage a new northern front against Israel if Israel [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=91.8s)]
*  goes into Gaza. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=97.6s)]
*  So they have to know that if they go into Gaza, they need to be prepared for a second [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=98.68s)]
*  front. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=101.88s)]
*  And we have actually the former Hamas leader on Al-Arabiya yesterday, television, saying [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=103.04s)]
*  we want Hezbollah to come in on our case. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=108.0s)]
*  We want Iran to come in further. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=110.68s)]
*  We're actually pleading to this axis of resistance, which is all over the Middle East, to join [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=112.32s)]
*  the fight. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=116.39999999999999s)]
*  They want to expand it. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  We want to keep it contained. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  If you look back over the last few days, Colonel, you've seen U.S. military assets directly [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=120.52s)]
*  attacked in Iraq, in Syria. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=126.5s)]
*  You've seen protesters assault U.S. embassies and consulates around the Middle East. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=129.56s)]
*  It would appear that to citizens of the Middle East, the U.S. is just as much part of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=137.08s)]
*  public-facing, as much public-facing in this war as Israel is. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=142.56s)]
*  How do you move forward? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=150.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, Jillian, I've been saying on Fox News for years that our troops in Syria, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=151.08s)]
*  in Iraq do nothing for American national security, but it keeps them a target of opportunity [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=156.52s)]
*  for these violent groups. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=161.56s)]
*  Now then you're seeing the potential risks that America faces, because so far we've been [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=163.16s)]
*  lucky. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=166.96s)]
*  None of these drones or these attacks have killed Americans, but the minute that one [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=167.96s)]
*  of them does and they tie it back to Iran, then now then we have the potential for escalating [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=171.52s)]
*  that we have to respond to Americans killed, because we can't turn a blind eye to Americans [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=175.9s)]
*  getting killed, but we don't need them sitting there just sitting in the desert wondering [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=180.24s)]
*  if they're going to get killed next time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=183.84s)]
*  That is a big potential for expanding this war that we have to be careful about. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=185.66s)]
*  Well, and to the point of 30 Americans we already know killed in what happened with [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=188.64000000000001s)]
*  October 7th and beyond that. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=192.56s)]
*  How do we respond to that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=194.44s)]
*  Because we actually do, you know, some people would argue we're at war with these groups [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=195.68s)]
*  too, because their American lives, not to mention those that are still missing and potentially [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=199.32s)]
*  hostages. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=202.68s)]
*  It's true, but what we have to do is we have to protect Americans that aren't have been [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=203.68s)]
*  killed yet, and we need to make sure that that doesn't go any further. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=208.08s)]
*  We need to deter Iran, because even our own intelligence, Israeli intelligence has said [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=211.52s)]
*  they don't see any direct planning by Iran for this, so we don't want to like attack [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=216.04s)]
*  Iran that could start a war, but we have to, as Secretary Pompeo said, he did not disagree [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=221.08s)]
*  on a number of things, but I sure agree with what he just said a minute ago, that we need [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  to deter Iran and not to actually go to war with them, because that would be catastrophic [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=229.0s)]
*  for our interest. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=233.64000000000001s)]
*  We do not need that. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=234.68s)]
*  Israel doesn't need that. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=235.68s)]
*  And then you have two nuclear powers fighting a ground war, which sounds incredibly dangerous. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=237.06s)]
*  Sounds incredibly World War III-ish that none of us want to go to. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=241.68s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need to go there. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=244.52s)]
*  Colonel, thank you. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0iIZBqFtA4&t=245.52s)]
