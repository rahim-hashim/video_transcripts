# Marjorie Taylor Greene: What happened to Israel could happen to America
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s)
*  Welcome back. Gun battles are raging this morning in South Israel as air raid sirens warn of continued [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=0.0s)]
*  strikes on Israel after Hamas launched an unprovoked attack on the state of Israel. This, as President [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=6.08s)]
*  Biden and a group of bipartisan lawmakers are pushing for more aid to Ukraine and to be included [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=12.8s)]
*  in the new budget. The U.S. has already committed more than $100 billion in aid to Ukraine since the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  start of Russia's invasion. Critics are demanding accountability on the aid before any more money is [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=23.28s)]
*  allocated and want to know what specific support the U.S. is giving to America's number one ally in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=27.92s)]
*  the Middle East, Israel, as it fights back this morning in a war with terrorist group Hamas. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=34.32s)]
*  Joining me right now, a woman who voted against sending any more money to Ukraine right now, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=39.2s)]
*  Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, a member of the House Oversight and Homeland [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=43.44s)]
*  Security Committees. Congressman, thank you very much for being here this morning. I want to get [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=46.8s)]
*  to the battle for the speaker's race in a moment, but first you're on the Homeland Security Committee. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=50.96s)]
*  What is the impact to the homeland, to America, as we watch this horrific story unfolding in [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=55.68s)]
*  Israel this morning? This should be a wake-up call to every single American, Maria, if they have not [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=61.6s)]
*  been woken up already. What happened to Israel could happen to America because our country has [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=67.36s)]
*  been invaded by millions of people from over 160 countries. And we've been invaded by people we [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=72.32s)]
*  don't even know where there are. There are so many gotaways the Biden administration cannot keep up [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=80.16s)]
*  with them and they're all over the streets, all over the entire country. And so what we're seeing [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=84.8s)]
*  in Israel could happen to the United States of America and it'd be foolish to ever think that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=90.8s)]
*  that's not possible. Has the war on Israel created an expedited situation in terms of getting a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=97.6s)]
*  speaker in place? Can you walk us through what will take place this week with regard to the [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=104.8s)]
*  speaker of the House? Yes, absolutely. We're in a serious, weakened position, Republicans that [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=109.12s)]
*  control the majority in the House of Representatives. I want to remind everyone that we barely [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=116.08s)]
*  control the majority of the House and that's only one-third of the federal government. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=121.04s)]
*  What happened last week I completely disagree with. It was eight Republicans joining with all the [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=126.48s)]
*  Democrats in the House and basically throwing the gavel on the floor and saying it's now up for grabs [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=131.52s)]
*  at anyone that wants it. This is not a serious thing to do when you control the House of [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=137.12s)]
*  Representatives. And no matter how you feel about Kevin McCarthy, I can tell you I was getting [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=142.48000000000002s)]
*  things accomplished because through Kevin McCarthy I was able to get the Ukraine money taken out of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=148.08s)]
*  the defense bill and I fought very hard for that and I'm proud that that happened. I also got an [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=153.12s)]
*  impeachment inquiry launched without a vote in the House of Representatives and that was because I [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=158.56s)]
*  urged him to do it and it was so important to seriously go after the Bidens for all of their [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=164.48s)]
*  criminal and corrupt actions they've taken while Joe Biden has held power. So I want change in [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  Washington too. I think it needs to happen but the only way real change can happen is when we [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=176.72s)]
*  control the White House, the Senate and the House of Representatives but I'm very concerned about [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  where we stand right now. Who are you supporting for speaker? I'm talking with the people that are [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=187.2s)]
*  running for speaker. The issues are important to me. I have a bill that would stop trenching or [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=193.76s)]
*  surgeries on children and that bill has been sitting in the Judiciary Committee for quite [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=199.92s)]
*  some time now and I would like to see it marked up and taken to the floor for a vote. So that's an [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=204.48s)]
*  issue I'm pushing. I'm also continuing to push to stop funding the war in Ukraine and push those [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=209.67999999999998s)]
*  countries to peace and now with what's happening in Israel we're looking at a whole different [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=215.35999999999999s)]
*  situation. I want to track the serial numbers of the weapons that Hamas is using against Israel [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=220.88s)]
*  and I want to know if they came from Afghanistan or if they came from weapons that we provided to [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=226.48s)]
*  Ukraine. So these are answers that I want from whoever's running for speaker. We heard from the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=231.28s)]
*  UN Ambassador earlier on Fox and Friends who said right now there could be dozens of Americans, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=237.2s)]
*  American Israelis being held hostage by Hamas. How does that change the level of [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=243.36s)]
*  engagement from America? It's extremely serious. Anytime Americans are held hostage in a dangerous [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=251.68s)]
*  situation like this where we're seeing women and children being kidnapped, babies held in cages, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=258.16s)]
*  elderly people were shot and murdered in the streets and if Americans are being involved in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=265.2s)]
*  this, this is a very serious situation that involves our country. Again I don't want to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=269.92s)]
*  see America go to war. I want world peace back like we had under President Trump but we have a crisis [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=277.2s)]
*  and we're being dragged into this if Americans are involved. Well I'm glad you said that. We [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=284.08000000000004s)]
*  are in a crisis because we certainly are given that war is now underway in the Middle East, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=288.48s)]
*  war on Israel and it is retaliating. Congressman you just went through a couple of issues that you [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=295.36s)]
*  want to see finished and completed the way you want to see them before you want to commit to who [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=301.12s)]
*  you're going to vote for speaker. You need 218 votes and you've got to get behind someone. Are [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=307.6s)]
*  we going to have the answer of who will take the speaker's gavel next week? I hope we can have the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=313.6s)]
*  answer Maria. Again I didn't cause this problem. You're not committed but you're not committing [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=320.4s)]
*  right now. You want answers on terms of that bill that you want moved before you give us an answer. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=326.4s)]
*  Right I serve the American people. I serve the American people and right now [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=333.28s)]
*  these transgender surgeries on kids is awful. I serve the American people and I don't think our [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=338.23999999999995s)]
*  tax sellers should fund a war in Ukraine. I serve the American people and I want our borders secured. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=343.12s)]
*  I serve the American people and I want our government to stop being weaponized against [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=348.4s)]
*  the American people. That's fine but if you don't get what you want are you saying that you will not [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=352.32s)]
*  agree to a speaker and will this go open-ended beyond next week? No I'm not saying I won't agree [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  but I want to hear our speaker candidates answer these questions and that's the right thing for me [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=365.12s)]
*  to do. I demand answers. I represent my district and whoever wants to be speaker needs to be able [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=370.96s)]
*  to answer how they'll handle those particular issues. Okay you think we'll get us we'll know [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=376.32s)]
*  who the speaker is by next Friday? I certainly hope so. We should have never been in this [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=380.64s)]
*  predicament in the first place but I certainly hope so. Congressman thank you. We'll be watching [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=385.92s)]
*  your work important work. Marjorie Taylor Greene joining us this morning in Georgia. Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xIObsXhvq2s&t=390.15999999999997s)]
