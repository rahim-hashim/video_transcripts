# Israeli TV host shares horror stories: 'We're dealing with savage animals'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w)
*  Survivors recount the horrors of Hamas's deadly surprise attacks on Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=0.0s)]
*  Romi Gior is one of those survivors and we thank the good Lord for that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=5.08s)]
*  She lives right outside of Tel Aviv and witnessed the deadly violence and destruction from Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=10.32s)]
*  At least two of her friends died at the music festival in which 260 people were killed. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=16.16s)]
*  Another military member died in the fighting. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=22.04s)]
*  Romi, you join me now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=24.48s)]
*  We've now seen the music festival, so many people across the world with paratroopers coming in. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=26.04s)]
*  The enemy from the sky. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=32.68s)]
*  Talk to me about that. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=35.36s)]
*  Not just the sky, actually, Harris, the sky, sea and land. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=37.96s)]
*  Literally hundreds of terrorists infiltrated Israel, went into the area of the party, the Nova Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=43.72s)]
*  I was actually supposed to be at that party. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=52.64s)]
*  I was supposed to go to that party. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=55.6s)]
*  My friends, they went to that party who turned into a horrific slaughterhouse, full blown out mass. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=57.32s)]
*  I know I do not have a lot of time, so I want to share with you, Harris and the viewers, just one story, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  I want to share with you one testimony of someone who was there and was able to get out of there alive, if I may. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  A friend of a friend. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=86.36s)]
*  We were able to hide in an all command post. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=88.92s)]
*  There were many people hiding there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=92.44s)]
*  Some were crying, some were shouting and others were in shock. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=95.28s)]
*  My best friend, Liron, was helping the wounded. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=100.28s)]
*  The gunshots were getting closer and a policeman who was with us said, pray and run. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=104.48s)]
*  We started running and I heard how people were falling one after the other. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=114.56s)]
*  Hamas was shooting at us nonstop. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=119.48s)]
*  I was able to reach an ambulance and as I looked back, I saw that I was alone. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=122.28s)]
*  Liron didn't make it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=128.32s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=135.48s)]
*  I listen to you and it's not happening to somebody else, it's happening to you and the people that you love. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=136.48s)]
*  I can't even imagine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=143.92s)]
*  What are you watching for that you need right now to learn more about? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=145.92s)]
*  Is it that the United States is getting more involved? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  What are you pinning your hopes on now? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=154.56s)]
*  If I understand your question correctly, then obviously the support of the United States is a big, big comfort. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=158.08s)]
*  If I could say thank you, if it wouldn't matter to anyone, then obviously I am thanking the support of the United States. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=168.96s)]
*  If I can tell you about what I am feeling as a citizen, an Israeli Jewish person, that this is nothing we've ever seen before. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=177.44s)]
*  We are dealing with the most savage animals known to mankind. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=194.4s)]
*  Families were murdered inside of their homes. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=199.28s)]
*  Hundreds got abducted over to Gaza. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=204.96s)]
*  Children, women, men, babies, elderly. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=207.36s)]
*  I have people on the news looking for their grandmother, mothers screaming their lungs out, searching for their sons and their daughters. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=213.36s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=221.52s)]
*  I cannot even explain. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=227.04s)]
*  I don't think a human mind can even comprehend this situation. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=229.04s)]
*  Over 6,000 rockets, even 7,000, I don't even know, were fired towards Israel so far. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=233.84s)]
*  We are dealing with the worst enemy. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  The worst enemy. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=248.0s)]
*  My condolences go to the families that have actually been through this horror movie in the southern cities of the country. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=250.96s)]
*  And still are going through it in the south. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=259.36s)]
*  And still, of course, still are going through it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=262.32s)]
*  And also the most terrifying number of them all. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=265.04s)]
*  We have over 900 people who got murdered. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=268.88s)]
*  Over 2,000 wounded. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=272.32s)]
*  And the number now is above 2,600 for wounded just from our last reporter. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=277.28s)]
*  You are in a position as someone who works in media in Israel to get so many of the stories like what you shared with us. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=284.0s)]
*  And I'm wondering what you can educate a wider audience about the kibbutz. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=291.68s)]
*  And how it is that Hamas would know to hit that, to go in, and now with reports of babies being beheaded. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=298.88s)]
*  How they know that that is where they go. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=311.2s)]
*  If I understand your question correctly, first of all, I must say I do not live in a kibbutz. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=313.2s)]
*  I live in a small city next to Tel Aviv. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  And it's by membership only? [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  And they're typically small? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=322.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, but also we must remember that all of those places, kibbutz and suburbs, I'll say these are all literal next to the wall that separates Israel from Gaza. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  So when they broke in through the wall that separates us from them, it was an immediate target because it was right next to it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=339.35999999999996s)]
*  The Gaza Strip is a very hot area here in Israel. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=347.84s)]
*  And I'm not talking to you as a reporter or a TV anchor. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=351.84000000000003s)]
*  I am speaking to you as a scared, terrified, terrified civilian that had lost a lot of friends. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=356.32s)]
*  And if I may, Harris, I know we don't have a lot of time, but there is a few words I would want to read for you and the American audience that is now watching us. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=364.32s)]
*  If I may. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=377.44s)]
*  Go ahead, Romina. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=379.52s)]
*  Never since the Holocaust did so many Jews die in one day. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=381.52s)]
*  But Hamas doesn't kill only Jews. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=387.52s)]
*  They killed Muslims, Bedouins, men, women, children. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=391.52s)]
*  Hamas is the new ISIS. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=397.52s)]
*  Right now, almost a thousand people were murdered and hundreds were kidnapped. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=399.52s)]
*  And to the people at home watching, I want to say that Israel didn't choose this war, but will act decisively to defend its people and bring our men, women and children back from Gaza. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  We will need the support of the American people at these harsh times. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  And together, we will end the terror that threatens not only Israel. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=429.59999999999997s)]
*  It threatens the entire free world. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=435.68s)]
*  And on a personal note, I want to thank the people of the United States for all the support and help. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=439.68s)]
*  We need to spread the word about what is really going on in Israel. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=445.68s)]
*  And from what I'm hearing, this could be a protracted, long battle to root Hamas out from where you are. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=451.68s)]
*  Thank you, and thank you for being able to, as you so graciously put it, tell us what it's like to feel that, but also report to us what it is to be among it from a reporter's perspective as well. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=459.76s)]
*  You did both, my friend. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=477.76s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=479.76s)]
*  Be well. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JPD97KtZB0w&t=481.76s)]
