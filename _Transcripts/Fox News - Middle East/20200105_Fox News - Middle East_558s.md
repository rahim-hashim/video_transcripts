# Judge Jeanine: Killing Soleimani needed to happen, Trump was the man to do it
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI)
*  Thank you, Mr. President. The killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guard Quds Force leader Qassem [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=0.0s)]
*  Soleimani needed to happen, and President Donald Trump was the man to do it. Everyone [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=7.8s)]
*  knew the blood of Americans was on his hands, responsible for the murder of more than 600 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  American service members and thousands of others whose blood and limbs were spilled [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=20.04s)]
*  and left on the sands of the Middle East. He implemented the explosive devices capable [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=24.68s)]
*  of piercing through our American armor. His ruthless reign of terror, both celebrated and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=31.0s)]
*  legendary against Americans, our allies and Muslims, would have continued had this monster [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  not been stopped. The president did not risk a single life in his effort to eliminate this [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=44.04s)]
*  sadistic beast who, according to all reports as well as his history, was a clear and present [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=51.0s)]
*  danger to America. Folks, you know the president means what he says and says what he means. He [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=57.6s)]
*  is not interested in war. He is interested in America and protecting it, and in so doing, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=64.16s)]
*  he will take swift, decisive and strategic action and take no prisoners along the way. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=71.64s)]
*  And whether they'll admit it or not, all Americans should be thankful. Our allies should be thankful. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=78.36s)]
*  Indeed, the world should be thankful for the removal of the world's most dangerous [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=85.76s)]
*  terrorist. Folks, this day has been 40 years in the making. I told you last year that Iran [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=91.56s)]
*  was determined to provoke us and indeed was provoking us. And to all those who criticized [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=101.0s)]
*  the president for not trying diplomacy, a primmer. This president has repeatedly tried diplomacy, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=107.88s)]
*  stepped back, talked about restraint and refused to take action when ironically criticized for [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=116.28s)]
*  not doing so. Take a listen. In the last month, as Iran has reacted to the economic stranglehold [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=124.16s)]
*  under which it is suffering because of the sanctions President Trump has put on it, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=130.96s)]
*  a far cry, by the way, from the rollover reward of $150 billion Obama gave them and gave that regime, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=136.76s)]
*  which was used to fund terrorism throughout the world, Iran is responding with extreme provocation, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=145.48s)]
*  hitting oil tankers. When an American drone, however, with a wingspan as wide as a 737, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=153.48s)]
*  was brought down by an Iranian missile, it seemed that Iran was determined to provoke us. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=161.0s)]
*  The president was ready to conduct strikes, but pulled back because as he said, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=167.76s)]
*  they shot down an unmanned drone, plane, whatever you want to call it. And here we are sitting with [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=174.72s)]
*  150 dead people and I didn't like it. I didn't think it was, I didn't think it was proportionate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=182.96s)]
*  And in the last two weeks, Iran has been responsible for an attack on a U.S. embassy in Iraq, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=189.32s)]
*  where an American was killed. Remind you of Benghazi? The parallels are frightening. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=195.64000000000001s)]
*  Soleimani actually helped plan the Benghazi attack, where four Americans were killed and our last [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=202.76s)]
*  president never bothered to respond, while he and his gang of apologists said the massacre of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=209.8s)]
*  Americans was due to a video. Here, this president Trump took swift and precise action. His response [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=216.44s)]
*  where an American was killed was immediate. Yes, indeed. The days of appeasement are over. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=225.72s)]
*  Gone are the days when the U.S. feats Iran, brings her to the table to give her 150 billion dollars [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=233.8s)]
*  and an additional 400 million on pallets flown in unmarked planes as the United States lets out [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=241.32s)]
*  the Gitmo detainees to return to the battlefield. We now have a president who negotiates from [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=248.28s)]
*  strength, not from weakness, a man who has exhibited tremendous restraint while constantly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=255.88s)]
*  being provoked by Iran. His red line was the killing of an American and true to his word, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=262.76s)]
*  it was only then that he responded. He had tried everything and economic sanctions were imposed, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=271.4s)]
*  themselves recognized as appropriate and responsible action in the spectrum of diplomacy, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=279.0s)]
*  and yet they continued to poke the eye of the tiger. The president even tweeted, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=285.56s)]
*  Iran will pay a very big price for any damage or loss of life. Quote, this is not a warning, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=291.48s)]
*  it's a threat. So should we roll over and let them kill us? Should we decide who should be [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=298.92s)]
*  killed first or how many of us we will tolerate being killed before we act? Should we allow [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=307.0s)]
*  further casualties? It's not an act of war. It's not unauthorized force when the commander [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=314.2s)]
*  in chief is defending Americans from imminent, deadly harm. And for those bozos who say that the [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  president is using Iran to distract us from impeachment, he could have done this on any one [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=330.68s)]
*  of the last 1079 days because they've been trying to impeach him since day one. And Chuck Schumer says [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=337.8s)]
*  this. This action may well have brought our nation closer to another endless war, exactly the kind of [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  endless war the president promised he would not drag us into. So for Chuck and all you snowflakes [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=356.12s)]
*  who say this means war, I've got news for you. We've already been in a shadow war with Iran [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=364.92s)]
*  for decades. They haven't confronted us with conventional military action because they're weak [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=374.2s)]
*  and we have superpower capabilities thanks to President Donald J. Trump. They've prosecuted [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=381.8s)]
*  their war against us by the use primarily of non-state proxies like Hezbollah in Lebanon, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=389.08s)]
*  the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas and Islamic Jihad, as well as the Shia militants in Iraq, Syria and [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=396.52s)]
*  Lebanon. So Iran denies responsibility and they conduct a shadow war with relative impunity from [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=403.96s)]
*  taking hostages in 79 to blowing up the marine barracks and killing 220 marines, blowing up our [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=413.32s)]
*  embassy in Beirut in 1983 to the most recent attack on oil tankers in an attempt to knock out [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=420.68s)]
*  the world's oil production in retaliation for our pulling out of the Iran nuclear deal and the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=427.64s)]
*  imposition of economic sanctions. In fact, Soleimani himself is quoted as saying, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  it is time to take our swords out and teach them a lesson. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=439.64000000000004s)]
*  By taking out Soleimani, we have put the Iranians on notice that its use of proxies will no longer [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  protect those who plan or give orders for attacks against us. They personally will be held responsible. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=453.40000000000003s)]
*  Trump's attack was precise. It avoided a needless loss of civilian life. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=463.88s)]
*  It did not entail boots on the ground. So does this mean inevitable war? [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=470.68s)]
*  No one can predict where this will lead. The Iranians have multiple military and economic [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=477.96s)]
*  interests in America, which they can target. However, they now know their use of proxies [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=485.08s)]
*  will not insulate them personally from retaliation and preemptive action. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=492.92s)]
*  The president's thinking on this has not been shoot from the hip. It was set strategically [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=498.84s)]
*  in motion this past April when Iran's Revolutionary Guard and its commanders were labeled terrorists [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=506.76s)]
*  that was the game changer. My friends, it served notice to Iran's leaders, particularly those in [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=515.8s)]
*  the Iran Revolutionary Guard, that they themselves, not their subordinates, will pay the price. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=524.04s)]
*  And if they go to bed planning an attack on America, they may wake up on the receiving end [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=532.84s)]
*  of an American plan to preempt them. Thank God for President Donald Trump. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=541.88s)]
*  And that's my open. Let me know what you think on my Facebook and Twitter. Hashtag Judge Jeannine. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFXE6l4sXNI&t=551.24s)]
