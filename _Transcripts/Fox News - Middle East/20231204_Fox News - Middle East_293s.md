# US needs to send a 'direct message' to Iran: 'We know what you're up to'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo)
*  Let's bring in former National Security Council spokesman and U.S. Marine Corps veteran John [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=0.0s)]
*  Elliott. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=3.9s)]
*  John, good morning to you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=4.9s)]
*  What do you make of these airstrikes that the U.S. carried out in northern Iraq, where [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=6.08s)]
*  several Iranian proxy fighters died, five in total? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=9.96s)]
*  This does seem different than previous strikes. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=14.36s)]
*  This one wasn't planned. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=17.28s)]
*  We saw that these fighters prepared some sort of drone or rocket attack and took them out. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=18.72s)]
*  On the ladder of escalation, do you think that this is the appropriate next step? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=23.36s)]
*  Well, Carly, it's very hard to tell right now, because we're just starting to get [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  the initial reports. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=31.8s)]
*  But what it does do is it puts a marker down just in a short way to the Iranian proxies [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=32.96s)]
*  and actually to their masters in Iran that, look, we're going to be actually killing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=41.16s)]
*  your people if you're attacking us. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  But Leon Panetta—this is Obama and Biden's former defense secretary—over the weekend, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=47.6s)]
*  said that these attacks, these response by the Biden administration has been too selective. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=53.64s)]
*  That was his quote, too selective. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=58.6s)]
*  And look, he's understating the fact. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=60.480000000000004s)]
*  Everybody's—everybody sees that these attacks, these counterattacks that they've [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=62.28s)]
*  given up to now are just hitting kind of empty warehouses in the middle of the night, and [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  that's really not appropriate. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=70.80000000000001s)]
*  So for this actual response right here, look, the bottom line—and this is what Panetta [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=72.12s)]
*  said—is that what the Houthis or what the other Iranian proxies operating in Iraq and [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=76.76s)]
*  others, even Hezbollah, what they need to understand is as soon as they fire anything [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=82.44s)]
*  against U.S. targets, that they will be killed, they will be absolutely responded. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=87.39999999999999s)]
*  That's what Panetta said, and that there will be an absolutely overwhelming response [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=91.6s)]
*  so that they're not even going to think about attacking U.S. forces here. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=96.12s)]
*  John, in the statement released by Central Command yesterday on the USS Kearney, there's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=99.52s)]
*  specific language that I thought was very interesting. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=105.92s)]
*  These attacks represent a direct threat to international commerce and maritime security. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=109.76s)]
*  They've jeopardized the lives of international crews representing multiple countries around [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=114.2s)]
*  the world. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=118.48s)]
*  We also have every reason to believe that these attacks, while launched by the Houthis [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  in Yemen, are fully enabled by Iran. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=125.12s)]
*  The United States will consider all appropriate responses in full coordination with its international [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=130.12s)]
*  allies and partners. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=134.86s)]
*  Putting Iran's direct connection there, which we all know and has been talked about [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=136.3s)]
*  in soundbites, isn't something that I've seen before. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=143.06s)]
*  It may have been, but it's definitely not the usual case that they put Iran on notice [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=146.36s)]
*  in writing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=153.36s)]
*  Is that significant to you? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  Well, once again, Griff, you're absolutely right that it's stating the obvious, but [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=156.22000000000003s)]
*  it is just possibly like these strikes that Karli was talking about. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=160.34s)]
*  What it is, is it's drawing a marker to say, look, this is—these are directed by [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=164.74s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=169.7s)]
*  Look, every single thing that the Houthis do is directed by Iran. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=170.7s)]
*  And this is something that, look, if they put it in writing here, that's great. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=173.98000000000002s)]
*  But what has to happen is a direct message to the Iranians that say, hey, we know what [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=177.26s)]
*  you're up to, whether it's with the Houthis, whether it's Hezbollah, or whether it's [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=181.7s)]
*  with your other forces that are up in either Syria or Iraq, we know that you are responsible [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=185.54s)]
*  for every single missile or rocket attack that is directed at us and that we are going [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  to hold you responsible. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=197.94s)]
*  And so, hey, to put it in writing, that's great, but let's see it backed up by real [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=199.82s)]
*  direct contact and direct message sent to Iran, not just in the last line of a press [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=203.68s)]
*  release. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=208.45999999999998s)]
*  John, there's also a situation that seems alarming. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=209.45999999999998s)]
*  We want to know how alarmed you are by it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=212.2s)]
*  We have a former U.S. ambassador to Bolivia. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=214.78s)]
*  His name is Manuel Rocha. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=217.9s)]
*  He was reportedly arrested in Florida, being accused of secretly serving as an agent of [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=220.36s)]
*  Cuba's government. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=226.5s)]
*  It sounds like it could possibly be a Farah violation, maybe something more serious than [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=227.5s)]
*  that. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=232.9s)]
*  How concerned are you about this, and what do we know about this so far? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=233.9s)]
*  Well, Carly, The Wire reports, as of just a couple hours ago, do not provide details. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=236.42000000000002s)]
*  They say that we're going to be getting more details later this morning. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=241.54s)]
*  So we'll find out. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=245.22s)]
*  But one thing, it's—if the FBI and the DOJ are going after anybody else in Florida, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=246.22s)]
*  not named Donald Trump, then that's actually news. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=252.14s)]
*  But on a serious point, though, what it is, is that if it is a Farah violation, Foreign [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=254.68s)]
*  Agent Registration Act violation, this is something that Hunter Biden is under investigation [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=259.14s)]
*  for. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=264.7s)]
*  And so this is something that they took a long time, five years, to look into with Hunter [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=265.7s)]
*  Biden, that now they're actually—let's have the same standard for a retired diplomat [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=269.34s)]
*  and for the son of the former vice president. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=273.38s)]
*  That would be a good idea indeed. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=276.54s)]
*  John Elliott, thanks for getting up early and starting things off for us on this Monday [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=278.38s)]
*  morning. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4nMO7sQJvo&t=281.54s)]
