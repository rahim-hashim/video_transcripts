# Jean-Pierre criticized for dodging question on hostage posters
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ)
*  The House voted to censure progressive Congresswoman and squad member Rashida Tlaib late last night [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  over her anti-Israel rhetoric, making her only the 26th member censured in House history. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=7.4s)]
*  The resolution serves as a formal bipartisan rebuke of Tlaib's remarks after Hamas' October [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=14.6s)]
*  7 terrorist attack, as well as her defense of the anti-Israel slogan from the river to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  the sea. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=26.12s)]
*  Twenty-two Democrats crossed party lines to pass it, while just four Republicans voted [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=27.52s)]
*  against it. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=32.88s)]
*  But Tlaib says she will not be silenced. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=33.88s)]
*  The idea that criticizing the government of Israel is anti-Semitic sets a very dangerous [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=38.120000000000005s)]
*  precedent and it's being used to silence diverse voices speaking up for human rights across [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  our nation. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=47.44s)]
*  I can't believe I have to say this, but Palestinian people are not disposable. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=48.44s)]
*  The cries of the Palestinian and Israeli children sound no different to me. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=58.12s)]
*  Why what I don't understand is why the cries of Palestinians sound different to you all. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=64.12s)]
*  Joining me now, Democratic Congressman from Florida, Jared Moskowitz, who voted to censure [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=71.72s)]
*  Tlaib. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=77.36s)]
*  Congressman Moskowitz, welcome. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=79.36s)]
*  And I know that this is a very personal issue to you. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=81.24s)]
*  In fact, your temple was targeted by five men in ski masks. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=84.08s)]
*  What happened? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=89.28s)]
*  Thanks, Kayleigh. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=90.28s)]
*  I appreciate coming on again. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=91.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, look, a bunch of kids went in ski masks, went to my synagogue in Parkland [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=93.48s)]
*  as the congregation was getting out from services and yelled, kill the Jews at people from my [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=100.6s)]
*  congregation, most likely because they saw this on TikTok. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=109.88s)]
*  They saw the hatred that's been on TikTok. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=114.72s)]
*  They say people pulling down posters of hostages as young people say, oh, this is all fake. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=117.36s)]
*  These people aren't real, like a magnet to these posters, like they have to tear them [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  down. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  We're seeing all of this like electronic fentanyl in these echo chambers of hate and it is sweeping [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=127.75999999999999s)]
*  young people in college campuses across America. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=134.84s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=137.48s)]
*  You mentioned those hostage posters being teared down. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=139.8s)]
*  It breaks my heart when I see it. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=142.76s)]
*  And I know that you're very complimentary of the Biden administration speaking out against [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=145.35999999999999s)]
*  anti-Semitism from the president. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=148.72s)]
*  But I want to play for you something that happened at the White House podium yesterday [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=151.48s)]
*  to that point. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=154.56s)]
*  A lot of videos of individuals who have been tearing down signs, many of these taking place [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=157.12s)]
*  in New York City, of Israelis presently being held hostage in Gaza. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=162.22s)]
*  Is the White House's view that these actions should be condemned, the pulling down of them, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=168.0s)]
*  or that that's a form of peaceful protest? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=174.08s)]
*  Look, I've sort of kind of seen the reporting here and there. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=176.48s)]
*  I think it was from last week, right? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=180.76s)]
*  There's been like 30 million videos that have gone around. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=182.48s)]
*  No, I know, I hear you. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=184.4s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=185.96s)]
*  I'm just not going to... [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=186.96s)]
*  I'm not going to... [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=187.96s)]
*  Is that peaceful protest to pull that down or should you not be doing that? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=188.96s)]
*  I'm just not going to go into specifics on that particular thing. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=192.4s)]
*  Congressman, should this be condemned outright automatically? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=197.36s)]
*  Yeah, of course. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=202.56s)]
*  We saw this, unfortunately, previously on the issue of anti-Semitism. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=204.36s)]
*  Now, again, I'm happy that the press secretary has put out something on Twitter condemning [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=207.96s)]
*  the removal of these posters. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=212.24s)]
*  And so, you know, I don't know why it can't happen at the podium and it has to continue [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=215.36s)]
*  happening on Twitter. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=219.24s)]
*  Obviously, that's concerning, but I'm happy the fact that the press secretary has come [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=220.24s)]
*  out and condemned that behavior. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=224.88s)]
*  And President Biden has been unequivocal on his support of the Jewish community and is [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=226.44s)]
*  calling out anti-Semitism. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  But I would say, Kayleigh, I don't know what it is. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  It's like a mental illness that we are seeing with people on the streets that they see these [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  posters and they just feel that they have to tear them down. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=241.96s)]
*  I'm meeting with families here in Washington, D.C., whose kids are missing, whose babies [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=244.84s)]
*  are missing, whose sisters are missing, husbands are missing. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=249.76s)]
*  They're held hostage in Gaza. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  And look, you have a right to protest in this country. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=255.4s)]
*  You have a right to free speech. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=257.24s)]
*  But we also have a right to respond and call these people out. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=258.64s)]
*  Something is clearly wrong right now with the youth of America that they think it's [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=262.52000000000004s)]
*  acceptable when someone has been kidnapped to try to erase that person. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=267.16s)]
*  Like they can't look at them and they just must tear it down. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=272.92s)]
*  And so, you know, this is a big problem right now for the Jewish community. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=277.08000000000004s)]
*  We're seeing anti-Semitism record highs in the United States. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=280.72s)]
*  People go into protests with signs that say kill the Jews, gas the Jews, cleanse the Jews. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=284.12s)]
*  Look, you can be for a ceasefire. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=288.35999999999996s)]
*  You can criticize the Israeli government. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=290.32s)]
*  But to be clear, when you're talking about removing Jews from the earth, that is hatred [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=292.4s)]
*  that we have not seen since the Holocaust. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=297.71999999999997s)]
*  And we are never going back. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=300.0s)]
*  Jews are going to speak up. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=302.12s)]
*  We are going to fight back. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=303.71999999999997s)]
*  We have learned from history and we're done being silent when we see this level of hatred. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=305.32s)]
*  Yeah, I can't imagine tearing down a poster of little 10-month-old Kefir Bebus, who has [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=310.32s)]
*  now spent a tenth of his life in captivity. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  Congressman, you joined 21 of your Democrat colleagues to vote to censure Rashida Tlaib. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=317.4s)]
*  Why did you do that? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=322.88s)]
*  And do you wish more Democrats would have joined you? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=324.4s)]
*  Well, look, everyone has a constitutional right to say what they want to say. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=327.56s)]
*  And we have the speech and debate clause here in Congress so they can say what they want to say. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=332.12s)]
*  But Congress as a body can also come together and decide, we disagree with those comments [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=336.64s)]
*  and that they don't stand for the comments of the body. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  Listen, from the river to the sea means the elimination of the state of Israel. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  We cannot redefine that. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  That's what it means. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=352.32s)]
*  That's how Hamas uses it. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=353.32s)]
*  Right? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=354.32s)]
*  We're not going to let people say Mein Kampf was a coloring book. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=355.32s)]
*  And so at the end of the day, that statement should not be used. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=358.44s)]
*  It's calling for genocide. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=362.56s)]
*  Hamas is using that as a way to wipe Israel off the face of the earth. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=364.6s)]
*  And so I'm happy that there was a bipartisan group of colleagues that said those comments [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=368.6s)]
*  don't stand for the House. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=372.8s)]
*  And let's be clear. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=375.52s)]
*  This is not happening in a vacuum. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=376.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=378.44s)]
*  Congressman, really quick. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=379.44s)]
*  Only 60 of 212 Democrats voted to condemn that phrase. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=380.92s)]
*  Do you wish more of your colleagues would have? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=384.16s)]
*  In that joint statement that was signed yesterday. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=386.08s)]
*  Yeah, well, look, Haley, you know how this place works. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=388.0s)]
*  You worked on Capitol Hill. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=390.92s)]
*  It's very rare that Democrats condemn their own colleagues and it's very rare that Republicans [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=392.52000000000004s)]
*  condemn their own. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=396.0s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=397.0s)]
*  It's very easy to deal with anti-Semitism across the aisle. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=398.0s)]
*  We have no problem calling it out when it's a Republican who does it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=399.76s)]
*  And Republicans have no problem calling it out when a Democrat who does it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=402.52000000000004s)]
*  But it's very rare to do it when it's coming from within your own. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=405.12s)]
*  And so look, I'm proud to have stood with the 22 folks. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=408.44s)]
*  Look, we're moving forward. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=413.32s)]
*  Obviously, this is not something we're going to dwell on. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=415.32s)]
*  But it is something that I think was directly important to say that while everyone can say [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=418.08000000000004s)]
*  what they want, right, they have a constitutional right to do so, the House can say that doesn't [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=422.46s)]
*  stand for the body. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=427.14s)]
*  Congressman, you have shown moral clarity on this issue over and over again. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=428.14s)]
*  Want to thank you for that. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=432.14s)]
*  And just on our way out, I also want to thank you for that bipartisan legislation with Michael [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=433.14s)]
*  Lawler to put those oil sanctions on Iran. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=436.64s)]
*  Thank you very much for your efforts. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=439.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=441.53999999999996s)]
*  Harris, you know, it is pretty unbelievable that people would tear down signs that you [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=442.53999999999996s)]
*  can't get just all 435 members of the House of Representatives on board with condemnation. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=449.54s)]
*  Yeah, I just would say to Representative Moskowitz and the other 21 people who voted to censure [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=454.54s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib, it is sad that you stand alone and many of those who voted are Jewish. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=462.06s)]
*  Where are the black members of Congress? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=468.42s)]
*  They marched with African Americans in the streets. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=470.34s)]
*  You're nodding. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=472.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=473.42s)]
*  I mean, they funded some of those marches. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=474.42s)]
*  Where are these voices? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=477.82s)]
*  And by the way, if she really, Rashida Tlaib really, really is brokenhearted about Palestinians, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=480.02s)]
*  what in the world is she saying to the leaders of Pakistan? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=486.42s)]
*  They have just expelled 1.7 million Palestinians with nowhere to go, but the neighbors who [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=489.74s)]
*  are desperate to take as many as they can, but now they're saying maybe not? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=496.1s)]
*  I mean, those numbers aren't too different from the ones who are trying to go from north [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=501.94s)]
*  to south in Gaza after the terrorists living among them calling themselves the government [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=505.52s)]
*  slaughtered people and slaughtered their own people. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=512.12s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=514.56s)]
*  The scarf doesn't tell me how she feels really. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=515.84s)]
*  Her actions do. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=518.8s)]
*  Call Pakistan. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=520.8s)]
*  Get a home for your people. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=521.84s)]
*  Call Jordan. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=523.12s)]
*  Call Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=524.12s)]
*  Call Iran, all the people with the money and the power, the command and control over the [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=525.12s)]
*  Hamas terrorists in Hezbollah. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=528.68s)]
*  I mean, if she really wants to make a difference, censuring her isn't going to force her to [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=530.72s)]
*  That's a great point, but Emily, to the point of Congressman Moskowitz, it's not easy to [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=535.12s)]
*  condemn one of your colleagues. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=539.12s)]
*  There's a lot of pressure put on you by your party, but he has shown moral clarity in saying [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  I stand on principle. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=544.68s)]
*  He has for that. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=546.0s)]
*  I'm so grateful. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=547.0s)]
*  I respect him. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=548.0s)]
*  I think the pressure put on by the party is one of those self-made machinations that those [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=549.0s)]
*  of us everyday Americans whose tax dollars pay those salaries don't care about. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=552.48s)]
*  Get it done. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=556.4s)]
*  Center that inappropriate, unacceptable rhetoric and that behavior. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=557.4s)]
*  That's what I see. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=561.08s)]
*  That's a pretty clear order. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=562.08s)]
*  I do want to point out his phrase, the use electronic fentanyl, I thought was so powerful [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=563.5999999999999s)]
*  because we are all able to understand fentanyl as an immediate death sentence. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=568.4s)]
*  Right? [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=572.1199999999999s)]
*  There's sort of no going back from that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=573.1199999999999s)]
*  And talking about the anti-Semitic behavior sweeping across TikTok, that is influence, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=574.7199999999999s)]
*  he said, the youth, for example, he called them kids. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=578.88s)]
*  I'll just call them monsters who wore ski masks and engaged in that vile behavior and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=581.04s)]
*  rhetoric toward his fellow synagogue members. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=585.76s)]
*  That was so apt. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=589.52s)]
*  It implies that there is no coming back. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=590.8s)]
*  It implies truly the death of the independent, free-thinking, compassionate, moral clarity [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=592.88s)]
*  position that none of these people seem to have anymore. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=597.88s)]
*  Final point. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=600.76s)]
*  I note that the way that the narrative is being phrased of the censor is for, this [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=601.76s)]
*  is by the mainstream media, comments made about the Israel-Palestinian war. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=606.08s)]
*  They are not just comments, everyone. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=610.8s)]
*  They are anti-Semitic comments. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=612.16s)]
*  And that same coverage, for example, was very clear with the descriptions of prior House [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=613.64s)]
*  members, the 25 who've been censored and why. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=618.28s)]
*  For some reason, hers also is being molded over and made less sharp than it really is, [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=621.4s)]
*  less vile. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=627.52s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jh3Laew8GfQ&t=628.52s)]
