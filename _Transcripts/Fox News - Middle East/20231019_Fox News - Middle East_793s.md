# McEnany: I NEVER thought Fetterman would be the rational one
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM)
*  President Biden set to deliver a rare primetime address from the Oval Office this evening, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=0.0s)]
*  8 p.m. Eastern Time. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=8.120000000000001s)]
*  He's expected to address the administration's response to Hamas terrorist attacks against [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=9.92s)]
*  Israel and Russia's war in Ukraine. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=14.18s)]
*  But we begin with the massive pro-Palestinian protest on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=17.72s)]
*  I think it's more accurate to call it pro-Hamas. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=22.96s)]
*  Here's Swarm, the Canon Rotunda, demanding a ceasefire. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=27.28s)]
*  Hello, everyone. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=32.08s)]
*  I'm Kaylee McEnany, here with my co-host, Emily Campagno. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=33.08s)]
*  Also joining us, Fox Business anchor and co-host of The Bottom Line, Dagan McDowell, director [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=36.6s)]
*  of the Tech Policy Center at the Heritage Foundation, Kara Frederick, and host of Making [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=41.760000000000005s)]
*  Money on Fox Business and author of Unbreakable Investor, Charles Payne. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=46.56s)]
*  Well, you're looking at video from inside the Canon office building, which showed a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=52.36s)]
*  large group chanting, ceasefire now, and calling for Congress to demand the fighting stop in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=57.0s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=63.32s)]
*  Now, let's remind you, ceasefire now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  It was Israel that was attacked, whose children were lit on fire. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=66.52000000000001s)]
*  It is Israel whose people were killed. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=70.28s)]
*  And you have a right to self-defense. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=72.16s)]
*  The laws of war state that. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=74.64s)]
*  The United Nations states that. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=75.76s)]
*  But ceasefire now, they scream. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  The protesters were spotted wearing black t-shirts reading, Jews say ceasefire now. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=79.3s)]
*  The protest followed a speech by Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib, who has repeated the lie that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=86.38s)]
*  Israel was behind the explosion near a Gaza hospital. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  Here she is outside the Capitol. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=97.46s)]
*  It's just, continue to watch people think it's OK to bomb a hospital. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=101.5s)]
*  We're children. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=109.5s)]
*  You know what's so hard sometimes is watching those videos and the people telling the kids [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=114.5s)]
*  don't cry. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=120.5s)]
*  President Biden, not all Americans with you on this. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=121.5s)]
*  Remember when she was chased down the hall and asked if she condemned the killing of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=125.5s)]
*  children? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=130.5s)]
*  She refused to do that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=131.5s)]
*  And it was our own Hillary Vaughn who tracked her down. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=132.5s)]
*  She joins us live from Capitol Hill with more. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=134.38s)]
*  Hillary. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=136.9s)]
*  Kayleigh will progressive Congresswoman Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib were quick to condemn [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=138.5s)]
*  the hospital attack in Gaza when they thought Israel was behind it, but slow to correct [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  the record now that we know that a Palestinian militant group is to blame for that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=148.02s)]
*  Congresswoman Ilhan Omar issuing a clarification to her tweet late last night, but her post [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=153.62s)]
*  with the misinformation saying Israel is guilty is still up. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=157.66s)]
*  And so was Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib's post as well. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=161.92000000000002s)]
*  Tlaib was rallying with pro-Palestinian protesters yesterday at the Capitol and blamed President [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=165.78s)]
*  Biden for not speaking up for Palestinian lives. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=170.9s)]
*  President Biden, not all Americans with you on this one. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=175.9s)]
*  And you need to wake up and understand that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=179.9s)]
*  We are literally, literally watching people commit to genocide and killing and mass majority [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=183.9s)]
*  just like this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=190.9s)]
*  And we still stand by and say nothing. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=191.9s)]
*  But Tlaib herself didn't speak up when I tried to ask her about Israeli children being [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=194.46s)]
*  slaughtered. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=199.46s)]
*  She said nothing at the time. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=200.46s)]
*  Tlaib and Omar and about a dozen House Democrats are supporting a ceasefire resolution. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=202.46s)]
*  But that idea is being shot down on the other side of the Capitol by Senate Democrat John [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=206.6s)]
*  Fetterman, who says now is not the time to talk about a ceasefire. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=210.82s)]
*  Also calling it, quote, disturbing that some of his Democratic colleagues would take a [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=214.70000000000002s)]
*  terrorist word over our key ally when it comes to who is to blame for the hospital blast. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=218.66s)]
*  I asked Democrats supporting the ceasefire resolution why they don't think Israel has [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=223.82s)]
*  a right to fight back. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=228.78s)]
*  Why do you think Israel does not have a right to defend itself? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=232.78s)]
*  Oh, it does and it will. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=234.78s)]
*  Why did you call for a ceasefire then? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=236.38s)]
*  Trying to save lives. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=238.38s)]
*  Do you think that Israel does not have a right to defend itself? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=239.38s)]
*  I've never said that. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=242.98s)]
*  Do you think they do have a right to defend themselves? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=243.98s)]
*  I think that it's important that everyone has a right to defend themselves against heinous [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=246.5s)]
*  acts. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=249.66s)]
*  I think that proportionality matters. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=250.66s)]
*  And in the Senate, Leader Schumer says that if Hamas is left to its own devices, they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=254.5s)]
*  will repeat the same attack that they have and will continue to until they're stopped. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=258.86s)]
*  Kaylee. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=265.21999999999997s)]
*  Hillary, thank you. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=266.21999999999997s)]
*  So I never thought John Fetterman would be the rational one, but here we are. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=269.02s)]
*  That's how far left some elected Democrats are. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=272.86s)]
*  I want to walk down memory lane. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=275.26s)]
*  Here is President Biden in 2021. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=277.34s)]
*  He had some pointed remarks of praise for the squad. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=279.46s)]
*  AOC is brilliant and the other three women we're talking about are really smart. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=284.06s)]
*  Rashid Tlaib, where's Rashid? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=288.26s)]
*  I tell you what, Rashid, I want to say to you that I admire your intellect, I admire [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=291.26s)]
*  your passion, and I admire your concern for so many other people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=298.62s)]
*  You're a fighter. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=303.06s)]
*  So praising Rashid Tlaib, that was in 2021. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=304.78s)]
*  I do want to point out Press Secretary Corrine Jean-Pierre condemned them after the Israel [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=307.18s)]
*  attack, the attack on Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=313.42s)]
*  Watch the press secretary. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=315.34000000000003s)]
*  We'll start with some members of Congress who have called for a ceasefire and they have [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=316.34000000000003s)]
*  not gone as far as backing the administration's call for support for Israel. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=322.06s)]
*  We're going to continue to be very clear. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=327.1s)]
*  We believe they're wrong. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=328.66s)]
*  We believe they're repugnant and we believe they're disgraceful. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=330.54s)]
*  Our condemnation belongs squarely with terrorists who have brutally murdered, raped, kidnapped [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=334.46s)]
*  hundreds, hundreds of Israelis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=339.02s)]
*  There can be no equivocation about that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  There are not two sides here. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=345.53999999999996s)]
*  There are not two sides. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=347.58s)]
*  There are not two sides. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=350.14s)]
*  Corrine Jean-Pierre is right, Charles Payne. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=351.14s)]
*  The press secretary condemned it, but in the wake of President Biden previously praising [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=353.46s)]
*  the members of the squad, I could tell you if I was press secretary and I had condemned [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=358.65999999999997s)]
*  these members, but President Trump had not, there would be reporters running up to my [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=362.26s)]
*  office and tell you heard from President Trump a condemnation. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=366.26s)]
*  I don't see that kind of pressure here and there should be that kind of pressure on the [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=369.46s)]
*  president. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=372.90000000000003s)]
*  You wouldn't have gotten out of the room. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=373.90000000000003s)]
*  You would not have gotten out of the room. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=376.02s)]
*  And let's be honest, you know, when President Biden was over there yesterday, he said some [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=378.1s)]
*  of the right words, but he also didn't have to sort of, you know, you could argue obviously [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=383.3s)]
*  that we're with Israel part, but he didn't mention Iran at all. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=387.3s)]
*  And I don't think he articulated the barbaric, you know, how barbaric Hamas is. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=391.52s)]
*  And then of course, control your rage. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=397.59999999999997s)]
*  You know, all of these sort of it's the same thing as almost saying ceasefire. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=400.4s)]
*  I mean, it's a sort of a don't go too far. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  One of the lawmakers is saying it should be proportional. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=406.68s)]
*  No, those are the kind of things that terrorists and evil, these evil factions have been doing. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  They took advantage of us. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=414.74s)]
*  We learned in America in 9-11, someone gets on a plane with a box cutter. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=415.82s)]
*  No, we're not going to fly to Cuba. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  We're going to whip you. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=420.16s)]
*  We're going to beat you down right there. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=421.16s)]
*  You're not going to ever take a plane. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=423.6s)]
*  You're never going to harm us. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=425.44s)]
*  We learned the hard way. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=426.74s)]
*  Israel has learned the hard way. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=428.56s)]
*  It won't be proportional. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=429.56s)]
*  We have to make sure it never happens again. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=431.06s)]
*  Period. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=433.76000000000005s)]
*  No doubt about it. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=434.76000000000005s)]
*  And Emily, where you have Ilhan Omar not deleting the tweet, but saying she was wrong. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=436.52000000000004s)]
*  It now Rashida Tlaib has retweeted something doubling down on her lies about Israel being [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=441.40000000000003s)]
*  behind this attack. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=447.92s)]
*  She retweeted Dan Cohen saying this. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=448.92s)]
*  Hananya Naftali proudly boasted that Israel bombed Gaza's Al Ali hospital before deleting [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=452.56s)]
*  and two minutes later lying that Hamas did it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=459.32s)]
*  So she is running with this lie in the face of Senate Intel, in the face of President [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=462.76s)]
*  Biden saying he's seen DOD data in the face of the Israeli government. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=467.20000000000005s)]
*  The data is there. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=471.08000000000004s)]
*  Her own party acknowledges the truth, but here she is yet again. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=472.08000000000004s)]
*  I can't think of a larger waste of a congressional seat than hers for so many reasons, including [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=475.36s)]
*  the fact that she perpetuates a horrible anti-Semitic position, doubles down on it, and as you pointed [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=482.48s)]
*  out, loves to flee when Hilary Vaughn asks her a question, but loves to hog the mic when [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=489.12s)]
*  it's her time to propagate those lies. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=493.96000000000004s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal editorial board did a really excellent job, I felt, of sort of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=496.68s)]
*  providing some color into how that was so damaging. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=499.56s)]
*  And think about how, just like Rashida Tlaib did, people ran with Hamas' lie to underscore [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=502.26s)]
*  the point. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=507.62s)]
*  So for some reason we're supposed to take a terrorist group at their word after they've [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=508.62s)]
*  butchered babies. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=512.34s)]
*  Oh right, that's right, but they don't lie. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=513.34s)]
*  That is so nonsensical to me, and yet that's exactly what the BBC, when they put in print, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=515.86s)]
*  they said there's no different conclusion. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=521.18s)]
*  It's hard to see what else this could be, they said, talking about the hospital bombing, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=524.46s)]
*  other than an Israeli airstrike or several airstrikes, given the size of the explosion. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=527.98s)]
*  So they are ascribing, given the horrific nature of it, the size, that it must be Israel, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=533.38s)]
*  that kind of deduction, which had nothing to do even with evidence whatsoever, based [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=538.24s)]
*  on their own skewed ratio, that's something that emanated around the world. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=542.5s)]
*  I'm glad Omar... [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=547.66s)]
*  Corrected. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=550.1s)]
*  Correct, but I'm so disappointed that the Western media and the mainstream media jumped [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=551.1s)]
*  on this. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=555.8000000000001s)]
*  And to your point about the proportionality, I also really appreciated the point the editorial [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=556.8s)]
*  board made, which is that it is Western unilateral disarmament. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=560.4s)]
*  That is the position that says there is no collateral damage and also it needs to be [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=565.04s)]
*  proportionate. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  Again, this is against the landscape of a butchery and an inhumane atrocity that we've [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=570.4399999999999s)]
*  never seen before, frankly. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=575.28s)]
*  It surpasses ISIS. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=577.0s)]
*  And yet Israel is supposed to gird their loins and be mute and quiet and contained and restrained, [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=578.5799999999999s)]
*  so that one civilian is not even killed. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=584.4s)]
*  That again is a position of disarmament unilaterally and it's a Western focus that has no place [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=587.36s)]
*  here, not only for the purpose of Israeli fighting back, of Israel fighting back, but [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=591.9599999999999s)]
*  also the way that they will. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=596.28s)]
*  And Dagan Rashida Tlaib, she is putting forward terrorist talking points. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=597.8s)]
*  Okay? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=602.64s)]
*  So it was terrorists who bombed the hospital parking lot. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=603.64s)]
*  And we don't know if children were among those, but if Gazan children died, it is because [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  of terrorists. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=612.36s)]
*  Look at this wall right now. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=614.06s)]
*  These are children who Rashida Tlaib would prefer to ignore while enabling this activity [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=615.3399999999999s)]
*  by spewing Hamas talking points. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=620.4599999999999s)]
*  Meet Khafir. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=622.42s)]
*  He's nine months old. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=623.42s)]
*  Look at this beautiful boy. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=624.4599999999999s)]
*  He's now a hostage of Hamas, who a sitting member of Congress is caring water for. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=625.66s)]
*  Meet his brother, Ariel, right beside him, that beautiful little boy who just got a haircut. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=631.4599999999999s)]
*  Meet Roz and Aviv, five and three years old. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=636.92s)]
*  These are hostages. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=640.02s)]
*  And a sitting member of Congress is caring water, spewing talking points for an organization [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=641.46s)]
*  holding these children and their mothers. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=647.64s)]
*  So Rashida Tlaib, her tears yesterday were about a bombing that did not happen and children [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=651.02s)]
*  who did not die. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=657.6s)]
*  And it was a stark contrast to how she reacted, and you brought this up, when she was confronted [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=660.1600000000001s)]
*  with the factional murder, barbaric murder of Jews in Israel on October the 7th. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  She gave those murdered Jewish children and mothers and families her back, her silence [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=672.62s)]
*  as she scurried as fast as she could into a private elevator. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=681.1s)]
*  We have long known that she is a vile, irredeemable hater of all Jews. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=687.0999999999999s)]
*  She has always wanted exactly what Hamas wants, and that's all Jews to be removed from Israel, [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=696.2399999999999s)]
*  from the river, to the sea, period. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=706.7399999999999s)]
*  So the story is no longer this woman. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=711.5s)]
*  The story is the Democrats. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=715.46s)]
*  They have an anti-Semitism problem on their hands, and in fact, Abigail Schreier wrote [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=718.7800000000001s)]
*  an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in 2019 that said that exact same thing that was about [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=723.5400000000001s)]
*  Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=729.26s)]
*  They're still in Congress. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=731.82s)]
*  So few are speaking up. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=734.14s)]
*  Congressman Moskowitz is speaking up, but yesterday Hakeem Jeffries was asked by the [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=736.94s)]
*  National Review about Rashida Tlaib specifically, and he said he hadn't seen her tweets. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=741.66s)]
*  That was his only response. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=749.9399999999999s)]
*  At every turn, every Democrat needs to be confronted not just with this moment from [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=752.1s)]
*  Rashida Tlaib, but everything that she has said that demonstrates her anti-Semitism and, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=758.26s)]
*  again, propaganda for terrorists, but everything that she says from this day forward. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=768.06s)]
*  And in 2019, when Democrats were confronted with the anti-Semitism, they were unable to [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=774.06s)]
*  pass a resolution cleanly condemning anti-Semitism, leading a member of their own party to say, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=778.8199999999999s)]
*  why can't we call out anti-Semitism and show we've learned the lessons of history? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=784.2199999999999s)]
*  We all should be able to do that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=788.92s)]
*  Pretty easy to do when there are babies who were killed. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaM_DHHHaIM&t=790.42s)]
