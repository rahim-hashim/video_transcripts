# ‘TIME TO MAKE A DEAL’: Expert on latest US-Iran nuclear talks
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs)
*  Let's bring in Dr. Rebecca Grant, senior fellow at the Lexington Institute. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=0.0s)]
*  Dr. Grant, are you surprised, first of all, that the Iranians even agreed to these talks? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=4.36s)]
*  Yes, and congratulations to Steve Wittkopf. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=11.08s)]
*  It has been years since there were real direct talks, and the reason is pretty clear, as [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=15.18s)]
*  the White House has said. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=21.64s)]
*  All the options are not only on the table, they're all deployed to the Middle East. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=23.72s)]
*  Somewhere between four and six B-2 stealth bombers forward in Diego Garcia, two aircraft [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=28.08s)]
*  carriers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=34.04s)]
*  That has really gotten Iran's attention, and they know that Trump has a battle plan. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=35.04s)]
*  If he needs it, Iran either has to talk or get their nuclear facilities bombed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=39.56s)]
*  Well, the president, you know, famously said many times during his first term that there [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=44.64s)]
*  were no new wars started while he was president, you know, 45. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  Would he start one with Iran? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=56.04s)]
*  I think that he will carry out strikes if he has to, but clearly what he's hoping [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=58.800000000000004s)]
*  for and it's working is to get Iran to talk. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=64.28s)]
*  You know, he tried really hard to do that during his first term. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=67.76s)]
*  He and some of the G7 even offered immediate cash to Iran, but nothing would bring them [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=71.32000000000001s)]
*  to the table. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  And now they realize that what with the situation with what Israel has done to Hamas and Hezbollah, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=77.76s)]
*  Iran being contained and hemmed in by U.S. forces as well, that now they really need [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=83.48s)]
*  to talk or they risk more instability in Iran itself. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=89.0s)]
*  And that seems to have been critical in getting the Iranian foreign minister to show up in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=93.88000000000001s)]
*  Oman and actually start these talks, which will take a while, but they've started. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=98.28s)]
*  General Jack Keene, our Fox News military analyst, says that Iran has to believe that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  the president means business here. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=107.76s)]
*  Listen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=110.72s)]
*  Look, our positions are about as far apart as they can be. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=112.72s)]
*  The reasons why the Iranians are actually talking, because the supreme leader did not [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=117.0s)]
*  want to engage in any discussion whatsoever, is because I think they've come to the conclusion [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=121.4s)]
*  that the president is dead serious about supporting an Israeli-led, U.S.-supported strike on Iran [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=126.56s)]
*  to take down their nuclear enterprise if they don't voluntarily dismantle it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=132.96s)]
*  Interesting what he said there, an Israeli-led, U.S.-supported strike on Iran. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=137.88000000000002s)]
*  So clearly, we're communicating with the Israelis about our intentions here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=144.16000000000003s)]
*  Well, General Keene is absolutely right, and I think how it would unfold, you know, so [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=149.0s)]
*  they want Iran to know this. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=154.12s)]
*  Remember, Israel took out a lot of Iran's air defenses last year. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  Then you have two carriers, U.S. land-based fighters in the region, to continue to work [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=160.08s)]
*  the air defenses and defend our forces. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=164.56s)]
*  And then, like I said, B-2 bombers and more available that are able to use massive, ordinance-penetrating [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=167.0s)]
*  weapons and get at those underground facilities. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=173.22s)]
*  So that's the threat display. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=175.94s)]
*  And remember, John, there's no reason for Iran to enrich their own uranium. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=177.9s)]
*  They're within perhaps a week of enriching enough to have a bomb. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=182.26s)]
*  They don't need it for nuclear power. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=186.42000000000002s)]
*  They can buy it on the global market like everybody else. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=188.06s)]
*  So it is time for them to start to make a deal. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=190.84s)]
*  And I think maybe, due to our military pressure and Trump's resolve, they're beginning to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=193.5s)]
*  realize it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=198.22s)]
*  And I think the pieces are falling into place. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=199.22s)]
*  The former secretary of state says the Iranians have to behave. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=201.5s)]
*  Let's listen to Mike Pompeo. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=205.7s)]
*  We have to fully, verifiably eliminate their nuclear weapons program for there to be any [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=209.3s)]
*  agreement. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=214.94s)]
*  And I see no evidence that the Iranians have any intention of doing that. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=215.94s)]
*  And I see no intention that they are willing to stop behaving badly all across the world. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=219.34s)]
*  All we ask is that they behave like a normal nation, and there is no indication they're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=224.94s)]
*  prepared to do that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=229.14000000000001s)]
*  So if they're not prepared to do that, Dr. Grant, it seems like explosions might be heard [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=230.98000000000002s)]
*  in Tehran or elsewhere. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, that's what Withkop and others are going to have to figure out. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=238.58s)]
*  I think there's a prospect of getting some agreement. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=242.5s)]
*  include real inspections. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=246.9s)]
*  It's going to have to include them giving up, frankly, some of that enriched uranium. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=248.94s)]
*  They know they're not going to want to do that. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=253.18s)]
*  And then there'll have to be some limits on their ballistic missile development. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  But there's no question that the military situation in the Middle East has turned to [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=258.64s)]
*  the point where now Iran is at risk at home. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=262.62s)]
*  Their president seems to understand that. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=265.94s)]
*  That's why they went to negotiate. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=268.02s)]
*  And I hope that we'll be able to really see some forward progress. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=269.82s)]
*  But the pressure has to stay on. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=273.24s)]
*  The negotiation is awfully tricky. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=275.34s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like the mullahs are going to have a tough pill to swallow coming out [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=276.34s)]
*  of these negotiations. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=281.46s)]
*  All right, Dr. Rebecca Grant, we appreciate it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=282.46s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=284.78s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVuhMgDUDSs&t=285.78s)]
