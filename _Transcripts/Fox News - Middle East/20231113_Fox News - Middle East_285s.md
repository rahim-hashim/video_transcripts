# Piers Morgan: This is a massive controversy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8)
*  Got a Fox News alert for you as you look live at Washington's screen left. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=0.0s)]
*  Tomorrow a historic, massive pro-Israel rally is being planned for Washington, D.C. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=6.0s)]
*  Meanwhile anti-Israeli protests rage across the globe, including in London. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=12.52s)]
*  At least 300,000 demonstrators marched on Saturday wearing Hamas headbands, screaming [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=17.2s)]
*  anti-Semitic chants, and as you could see in some video, clashing violently with the [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=23.76s)]
*  cops. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  Well this morning UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak firing a senior official who accused [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=30.240000000000002s)]
*  police of favoring the pro-Palestinian protesters. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=35.64s)]
*  Here to react, host of Piers Morgan Uncensored on Fox Nation, Piers Morgan himself. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=39.2s)]
*  Hey Piers. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Well good morning, it's all kicking off here, I can tell you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, what's the reaction there? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=47.56s)]
*  Well two dramatic developments this morning. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=50.44s)]
*  We had this big march on Saturday and there was a huge controversy leading up to it because [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=52.56s)]
*  the Home Secretary, our Interior Minister, Suheila Bravaman, had written a piece for [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=57.72s)]
*  the Times newspaper in which she was heavily critical of the police and many people thought [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=63.12s)]
*  undermined the police by saying that at previous pro-Palestinian marches they hadn't done enough [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=68.64s)]
*  to identify people that were pro-Hamas and to arrest them and so on. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=73.72s)]
*  But more importantly I think for her career prospects, Suheila Bravaman sent this piece [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=78.12s)]
*  before publication to the Prime Minister and who sent back some amendments and told her [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=83.08s)]
*  to take some stuff out. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=87.64s)]
*  She took some of it out but not all of it. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=89.0s)]
*  And by not taking out everything she was told to take out she was undermining the authority [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=91.72s)]
*  of the Prime Minister. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=95.74s)]
*  So we wake up this morning, an early morning here in London, Rishi Sunak fired his Interior [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=97.16s)]
*  Minister Suheila Bravaman and then equally dramatically he had to move someone to the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=103.36s)]
*  Home Office. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=109.16s)]
*  He moved James Cleverley who was the Foreign Secretary. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=110.16s)]
*  He's been moved to be the new Interior Minister and guess who's coming back to run the Foreign [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=113.28s)]
*  Office? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=118.72s)]
*  David Cameron, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=119.72s)]
*  Quite remarkable. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=122.76s)]
*  No kidding. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=123.76s)]
*  And Pierce as we look at, a surprise comeback, as we look at that video of what happened [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=124.84s)]
*  particularly on that bridge over the river Thames I believe. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=131.6s)]
*  How do you as somebody who is on the side of Israel explain why so many of those people [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=136.6s)]
*  are pro-Hamas? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=143.32s)]
*  Yeah look it's a massive controversy here as I know it is in the United States. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=144.32s)]
*  A lot of people, particularly the Jewish community in the United Kingdom, feeling extremely angry [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=151.44s)]
*  that more is not being done to police these protests. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=157.2s)]
*  And they've got a very good argument. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=161.04s)]
*  There were people literally chanting on video, posted on social media, death to the Jews. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=162.92s)]
*  There were people wearing pro-Hamas insignia and so on. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=169.0s)]
*  And they were not arrested. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=173.72s)]
*  Now the police have retrospectively posted some stuff on social media asking for information [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=174.72s)]
*  leading up to these people being brought to justice. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=180.84s)]
*  But many people arguing, and I have great sympathy with this, that they should be doing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=183.68s)]
*  that in real time. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=187.44s)]
*  You may remember the coronation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=189.24s)]
*  I mean Ainsley you and I were there and on the morning of the coronation, Republicans [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=190.52s)]
*  who were anti the idea of a monarchy were being rounded up all over central London and [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=195.56s)]
*  arrested to stop them protesting against the monarchy on the day of our coronation. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=201.32s)]
*  But here you have people, not all, I have to say the majority of people on that march [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=206.24s)]
*  definitely were there for peaceful purposes. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=211.48s)]
*  There are still large numbers of people who were not, who were promoting a terror organisation, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=214.72s)]
*  which is a criminal offence. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=219.68s)]
*  And unlike the Republican protesters at the coronation, they were not arrested. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=221.08s)]
*  And I think as these marches continue, which they're planning to do, the police have to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=225.08s)]
*  do more, which ironically is one of the things that Soella Brabhaman was calling for them [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=229.76s)]
*  to do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=234.16s)]
*  But it was really defying the authority of the Prime Minister, who's tried to straddle [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=235.16s)]
*  a careful line on this, that has in the end cost her her job. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=239.04s)]
*  Now we have a new Home Secretary and we also, and Americans will I'm sure remember him, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=242.92s)]
*  David Cameron, will now be Foreign Secretary, and doubtless will come to the United States, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  but not as Prime Minister. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=252.04s)]
*  He led this country for six years, but as the new Foreign Secretary. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=253.56s)]
*  And that is in many ways being seen in this country as a bigger bombshell than the Home [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=257.56s)]
*  Secretary being fired. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=262.96s)]
*  Yeah, nobody saw that one coming. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=264.32s)]
*  All right, Pierce, thank you so much. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EEgMGnZZNK8&t=266.03999999999996s)]
