# Mike Pompeo: This would be ‘victory’ for Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw)
*  Let's bring in Fox News contributor, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, first off, what do you think is behind the delay of the Iranian response? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=3.48s)]
*  Oh, I think the Iranians are always trying to use whatever leverage they have, Brian, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=10.0s)]
*  to find the maximal moment to inflict pain. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=15.8s)]
*  We shouldn't forget, we say there's a delayed Iranian response. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=18.32s)]
*  It's true they haven't done all that they have threatened to do, but you have 100,000 [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=21.400000000000002s)]
*  Israelis still can't live in their homes because of the attacks, the missiles that come in [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=25.92s)]
*  every day into northern Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=29.2s)]
*  You still have the Gazans firing. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=31.28s)]
*  You have the Houthis firing missiles. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=33.16s)]
*  So we talk about what are we waiting for. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  The Iranians are still full on. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=37.18s)]
*  They're holding Americans hostage. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=38.76s)]
*  They've now hacked a presidential campaign inside the United States. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=40.68s)]
*  This is not something that we're waiting for. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=44.92s)]
*  The Iranians are engaged in bad behavior because the American administration has refused to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=46.6s)]
*  impose any costs on them, Brian. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=50.96s)]
*  And we have not responded to the attack on our base in Iraq still to this day. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=52.92s)]
*  It's nuts. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=57.480000000000004s)]
*  Let's look at some of the terms that we think are on the table. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=58.559999999999995s)]
*  The ceasefire talks that will begin tomorrow. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=60.76s)]
*  Six-week full and complete ceasefire in return of withdrawal of the IDF forces from all populated [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=64.08s)]
*  areas in Gaza, a release of the hostages, including women and elderly, and wounded held [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=69.52s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=74.12s)]
*  Sure, not all of them, and release of hundreds, if not thousands of Palestinian prisoners, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=75.12s)]
*  release of some American hostages. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=80.44s)]
*  Phase two will be permanent end to hostilities, release of all living hostages, Israeli forces [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=81.92s)]
*  withdrawal from Gaza, and the final phase, major reconstruction plan for Gaza and final [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=87.24s)]
*  remains of hostages returned to the families. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=91.56s)]
*  But this is not going to happen on the Israeli side unless the whole, the higher-ups in Hamas [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=93.83999999999999s)]
*  are dead, especially Sinwar. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=100.6s)]
*  Brian, I think that's absolutely right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=103.28s)]
*  Moreover, it doesn't talk at all about the Iranian nuclear program. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=106.64s)]
*  We sometimes get focused so much on Hamas and we forget that the problem sits in Tehran. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  The problem is the Iranian leadership. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=114.47999999999999s)]
*  When the Biden administration talks about a ceasefire, Hamas gets excited, Tehran gets [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=117.08s)]
*  excited because that's a great outcome for them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=121.76s)]
*  They can repeat, as they have promised to do, they can repeat October 7th again and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=124.0s)]
*  again and again. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=127.80000000000001s)]
*  It is silly to think about a ceasefire. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=129.16s)]
*  I hear all those terms. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=130.6s)]
*  I see this diplomatic scrambling around, and I think what foolishness it is to accept, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=132.20000000000002s)]
*  for America to accept, that Iran is going to impose costs, kill 1,200 Israelis, hold [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=138.8s)]
*  American hostages, and we're simply going to say, hey, let's try and return to the [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=144.0s)]
*  status quo before this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=147.4s)]
*  It's dangerous, it's perilous for America, and the Iranians feel like this is victory [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=149.28s)]
*  for them. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  If they survive, they win. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  Lastly, it's been three years since the Taliban took back Afghanistan. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  The biggest embarrassment in American military history, and the sole author, was this administration. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=160.52s)]
*  President Biden and the person who was in the last room advising him, Vice President [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=167.28s)]
*  Harris. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=171.44s)]
*  Your thoughts, as we gave, still gave them $3 billion, left 600,000 worth of weapons, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=172.44s)]
*  75,000 vehicles, and China and Iran are sending delegations to celebrate with the Taliban [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=178.11999999999998s)]
*  today. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=183.92s)]
*  How do you feel as the former Secretary of State? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=184.92s)]
*  You know, Brian, it breaks my heart. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=188.72s)]
*  I was so involved in what we were doing there, the good work our soldiers, sailors did there [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  for years and years to save American lives, and then Vice President Harris and President [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=193.92s)]
*  Biden threw it away because they just wanted out. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=197.6s)]
*  Not only did we get 13 of our service members killed that day, but we now have incredible [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=201.0s)]
*  strategic risks to the United States coming from Afghanistan as a result of what they [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=205.4s)]
*  knew would happen. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=209.51999999999998s)]
*  Don't let Vice President Harris kid you, she was told this would happen, they withdrew, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  it happened, and this is on to them. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=215.82s)]
*  Right, and that's what we can expect with a foreign policy. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  How can you not? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=220.76s)]
*  When you said you were the last person in the room, right? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=221.76s)]
*  She owns this decision and she owes America an explanation of why she surrendered that [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=226.84s)]
*  day and harmed America in a way that is so devastating and continues to create risk to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=231.28s)]
*  this day. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=235.96s)]
*  All right, thanks so much, Mr. Secretary, because they like to blame you guys. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=236.96s)]
*  Thanks, Brian, have a good day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=239.76s)]
*  And you've always pushed back effectively. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jgwuHrIVwpw&t=240.76s)]
