# ‘WILLFUL DISHONESTY’: Politicians cannot support LGBTQ and Palestine at the same time
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8)
*  Meanwhile, more than 700 celebrities signing a letter to support Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=0.0s)]
*  calling Hamas evil and demanding the return of hostages. This includes our next guest who says, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  for once, he agrees with Hollywood. It's actor Dean Cain who says Israel holds a special place [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=8.16s)]
*  in his heart and he has spent plenty of time there. I think Dean has been there recently and [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=14.72s)]
*  Dean joins us now. Dean, great to have you on the show. So tell me about your thoughts on this [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=19.92s)]
*  letter signed by so many actors and members of Hollywood. Well, you said it well, Will. Very [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=25.6s)]
*  rarely do I agree with statements coming out of Hollywood, but this is a no-brainer. I'm glad there [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=32.32s)]
*  were 7,000 people who signed this letter. There should have been 70,000 in my opinion. How anybody [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=37.28s)]
*  could not call out the atrocities of what Hamas has done going after children, Holocaust survivors, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=43.52s)]
*  complete civilians and butchering them in the disgusting way that they have is beyond me. I [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=51.28s)]
*  see the outrage on college campuses and things of that nature, calling for from the river to the sea [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  and things like that. After an event like this, it just stuns me. So it does my heart well to see [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=64.24000000000001s)]
*  that there are people in my industry who are actually standing up for the right thing. So I'm [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=70.88s)]
*  proud to sign on to this letter. You know, Dean, I'm even hesitant to ask this next question because [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=75.28s)]
*  I do appreciate that positivity, you know, and we should point out acts that are well done. So [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=78.8s)]
*  I want to pivot to asking about those that are not quite as commendable, but I'm turning to you this [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=84.8s)]
*  kind of as an act of explanation. You saw what BLM did, Dean. I know you saw that, you know, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=90.24s)]
*  putting out support essentially of Hamas, not just Palestine, but Hamas. It makes me think about guys [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=95.28s)]
*  like Howard Stern who, if you ever listen to his program, he's incredibly pro-Israel, but at the [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=99.84s)]
*  same time, he says he's proud to be woke. And it's like, you can't continue to reconcile these [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=105.28s)]
*  thoughts when they become inextricable. I know that probably in their mind they say, well, you [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=109.6s)]
*  know, that's just one incident. No, these two ideologies are married at the hip. And I don't [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=113.36s)]
*  understand how so many celebrities don't understand. Not only celebrities, look at Rashida Tlaib. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=118.64s)]
*  She's got an LGBTQ flag and a Palestinian flag. Those just don't go together, my friend. So [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=126.4s)]
*  there's so many people who are doing that. I think it's, you know, it's willful dishonesty. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=134.24s)]
*  And I just don't understand it myself. Again, that's why I'm so shocked that so many people [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=138.56s)]
*  from Hollywood actually are doing the right thing. And I'm super, super happy about that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=142.72s)]
*  I don't know if you saw the comedy. Rachel sent it to me this week. I don't know if you saw on [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=146.8s)]
*  YouTube the comedy skit, a guy named Ryan Long, where he talked about all these celebrities trying [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=150.4s)]
*  to figure out which side of this issue to be on. It's, you know, I don't know which victim group [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=154.24s)]
*  I'm supposed to align with. It all boils down to actually which one's the most popular. But you're [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=158.16000000000003s)]
*  right. It is inspiring or hopeful to see celebrities. No surprise with you, Dean, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=162.96s)]
*  but so many other celebrities choose the right side of something like this. Thanks, man. Great [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=169.52s)]
*  to see you. My pleasure. Cheers. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian Kilmeade. And I'm Ainsley [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYM4ixag0i8&t=173.36s)]
