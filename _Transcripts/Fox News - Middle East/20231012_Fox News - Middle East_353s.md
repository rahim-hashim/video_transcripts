# ‘UNIMAGINABLE TERROR’: Small town ‘horror’ in Israeli homes
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs)
*  Let's go to Trey Yankst reporting from the ground, Southern Israel, Trey. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=0.0s)]
*  Harris, good afternoon. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=7.2s)]
*  We've just returned from the site of that music festival massacre with the army. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=9.64s)]
*  We were looking through the area and we could just see so many cars left open in the middle [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=15.16s)]
*  of the road. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=20.52s)]
*  People tried to get out and run for their lives. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=21.52s)]
*  It was a music festival like anywhere in the world. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=24.02s)]
*  There were different stations set up for people to paint and do art. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=26.44s)]
*  Other areas you could see different DJs and even camp there, a big campsite. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=30.040000000000003s)]
*  And it was a place of joy and happiness until these militants came and stormed the ground, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=35.68s)]
*  killing so many people. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=42.0s)]
*  As we were at this site, there were authorities there and they were digging through the remains [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  of a bus looking for the bodies of individuals, Israeli civilians who had been burned underneath [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=49.1s)]
*  that bus. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=57.06s)]
*  And as we were looking at this area, a gunshot rang out in the air and suddenly the army [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=58.7s)]
*  told us, everyone get down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=63.660000000000004s)]
*  We need to move. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=65.3s)]
*  And we started running and the army ran into the woods and in the treeline next to where [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=66.86s)]
*  we were reporting, they pulled out a Palestinian militant. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=73.22s)]
*  They bound his hands behind his back and put a blindfold over his face and took him [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=77.9s)]
*  off. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=82.18s)]
*  We're going to have video of all of that later in the show. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=83.18s)]
*  We're working hard to get that to you now, but it gives you a sense of just how active [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=85.14s)]
*  the scene is here. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=88.9s)]
*  There are still Palestinian militants hiding throughout this area and ongoing infiltration [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=89.9s)]
*  attempts. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=94.9s)]
*  To give you also a sense of the terror inflicted on this population, yesterday we visited Kibbutz [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=96.10000000000001s)]
*  community very close to here that had a population of around a thousand people. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=102.78s)]
*  Ten percent of their community was slaughtered in this cross-border attack. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=108.26s)]
*  And I do want to show you the report that we can bring you from there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=113.18s)]
*  I do need to warn our viewers. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=116.26s)]
*  Some of the following images are incredibly graphic. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=117.9s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=120.82s)]
*  The roads toward the southern Kibbutz of Be'eri are lined with Israeli soldiers and the bodies [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=122.5s)]
*  of Palestinian militants they've killed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=128.46s)]
*  A CCTV video from Saturday morning shows Hamas fighters waiting at the gate of this quiet [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=131.73999999999998s)]
*  community before ambushing a civilian car. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=136.45999999999998s)]
*  Once inside, they would inflict unimaginable terror on the population of one thousand. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=139.89999999999998s)]
*  People that someone cut their hand, people that captured and their hand was locked and [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  someone killed them, children in the same room, then someone come and kill them all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=152.18s)]
*  The kitchen floors are stained with blood. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=157.68s)]
*  People were home at the time. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=161.38s)]
*  It was early in the morning on Saturday when Hamas militants stormed into their homes. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=162.38s)]
*  The soldiers here tell us they found bodies that appeared to be executed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=168.18s)]
*  People with hands tied behind their backs, mothers holding their small children, bodies [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=172.72s)]
*  decapitated. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=177.74s)]
*  Pure horror in this small town. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=179.38s)]
*  In Be'eri, a place known for its art gallery, it's the small details that paint a horrific [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  picture. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=187.18s)]
*  A pile of Legos on the ground, food atop a table for breakfast and photos that hang on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=188.18s)]
*  the fridge, just like any home would have. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=193.62s)]
*  People were resting on the weekend with their loved ones when the massacre took place. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=196.78s)]
*  Now 10% of Be'eri is dead. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=200.94s)]
*  Some entire families wiped from existence. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=203.66s)]
*  The bodies of local residents litter the area. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=206.72s)]
*  They didn't have anywhere to go, no one to help them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=210.26000000000002s)]
*  The smell of death pierces the air. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=213.88s)]
*  There is nothing left to this community. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=216.26s)]
*  We talk a lot about the bombs and the rockets and the strikes and the artillery, but this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=221.98s)]
*  is a story about people. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=228.54s)]
*  People who were at home and were massacred. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=230.62s)]
*  And the Israelis are still finding scenes and aftermath following the attack on Saturday. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=233.06s)]
*  And as you can see the jeeps going behind me, they are preparing for that eventual ground [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=238.86s)]
*  operation into Gaza. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=243.18s)]
*  Harris. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=244.98s)]
*  I just want to point out a little wording difference today and I want to see if it's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=246.14s)]
*  a technical difference or not. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=250.1s)]
*  And that is eventual. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  We've known from military officials, particularly here in the United States, that what they're [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=254.17999999999998s)]
*  doing is they're softening the ground to go in for a potential possible invasion. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=258.92s)]
*  But when you say words like eventual, are you seeing a tick up in that softening of [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=265.12s)]
*  the ground? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=269.14s)]
*  How do you know and what's really coming in your estimation based on what you're seeing? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=270.14s)]
*  Based on the officials we've spoken with, it's not a matter of if Israel will go into [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=276.98s)]
*  Gaza but rather when. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=282.5s)]
*  We just spoke with a military officer a few moments ago and he indicated that the scenes [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=284.5s)]
*  we are seeing and capturing on our camera are the same scenes that are motivating his [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=291.42s)]
*  soldiers. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=297.06s)]
*  You could see it in his eyes. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=298.06s)]
*  He told me we will hunt down every single terrorist. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=300.0s)]
*  Those were his words. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=303.82s)]
*  That appears to be the plan. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=305.58s)]
*  The Israelis eventually going into Gaza and going after every single member of Hamas they [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=307.38s)]
*  can find. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=313.85999999999996s)]
*  They don't care if it takes months. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=314.85999999999996s)]
*  They plan to do just that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=316.9s)]
*  And based on the staging that we have seen, Harris along the border, you see the jeeps [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=318.82s)]
*  go behind me, the tanks, the APCs, just the sheer number of soldiers off in the distance. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=322.7s)]
*  They appear to be getting ready for a months long operation. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=328.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't want to guess exactly how long it will take. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  The infrastructure is here for the Israelis to be here for quite some time. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=335.18s)]
*  Harris. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=339.26s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you very much. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=340.98s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H9y-eYbp5cs&t=342.82s)]
