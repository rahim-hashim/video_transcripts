# DOJ launches new task force to deliver on one of Trump's big promises
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8)
*  In response to those anti-Israel protests on college campuses, the Justice Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=0.0s)]
*  announcing the formation of a multi-agency task force aimed to combat anti-Semitism in [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=5.68s)]
*  the U.S. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=11.68s)]
*  My next guest says this is the quote, first step in giving life to President Trump's renewed [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=12.68s)]
*  commitment to ending anti-Semitism in our schools. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Senior counsel to the assistant attorney general of the Civil Rights Division, Leo Terrell, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=22.44s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=27.96s)]
*  And Leo, I believe this is your first television interview since leaving Fox News. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=28.96s)]
*  We are so happy to have you on the program today. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=33.92s)]
*  Thanks for coming. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=36.64s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, Ann. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=37.64s)]
*  I left the great company Fox News and for a job from the greatest, in my opinion, in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=38.64s)]
*  my lifetime, the greatest president to give me a chance to serve this country. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=44.84s)]
*  And I'm working for a great attorney general, Pam Bondi, in basically eliminating this dual [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=48.96s)]
*  system of justice and providing justice in this country again. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  So Leo, tell us about this task force, which is coordinated under the auspices of the DOJ's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=60.0s)]
*  Civil Rights Division. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=67.0s)]
*  What's the goal here? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=68.5s)]
*  Very simple, Anita, and thank you for that question. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=70.2s)]
*  First of all, everyone in this country saw what happened the last three or four years. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=72.97999999999999s)]
*  Jewish Americans were ignored by the federal government, ignored by local officials. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=76.0s)]
*  Jewish American students couldn't go to school without being harassed. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=80.24s)]
*  It happened across this country. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=83.94s)]
*  Pam Bondi has created a task force to combat anti-Semitism, and I'm privileged to head [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=85.94s)]
*  that task force. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=93.38s)]
*  What that means, Anita, is that we're going to use every tool in the toolbox, civil, criminal [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=95.62s)]
*  activities to stop the harassment of Jewish students. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=101.02s)]
*  That means we're going to take criminal action. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=104.46s)]
*  We're going to cut off funding. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=105.82s)]
*  We're going to do everything, and we're formulating that right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=107.14s)]
*  Yeah, to your point, we all remember what we saw on college campuses across the country, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=110.74000000000001s)]
*  from Columbia University to UCLA. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=115.78s)]
*  I believe we have the video where Jewish students were literally barred from going to class [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  by pro-Palestinian protesters, in some cases pro-Hamas protesters. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  No one, there you go, look at that. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=130.34s)]
*  No one seemed to be doing anything about it, and we heard very little from the last administration [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=132.7s)]
*  on why this was so wrong. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=138.5s)]
*  So how is this going to change now? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=141.14s)]
*  Well, you heard crickets from the last administration, and in those protests, I was embarrassed to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=142.89999999999998s)]
*  see my law school, UCLA, allow this type of harassment going on. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=147.89999999999998s)]
*  And Columbia University, how it's going to stop is very simple. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=153.01999999999998s)]
*  We're going to cut off their funding. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=155.54s)]
*  We're going to take criminal activity against those protesters. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=157.82s)]
*  We're going to alert these blue cities that allow this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=161.29999999999998s)]
*  You have to get actively involved. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=164.1s)]
*  This is the mission that Pam Bondi has given me to proceed with, and we have the education [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=166.42s)]
*  department, Anita, health and human services involved. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=171.54s)]
*  This is a joint task force to stop this, and I would tell the Jewish community, help is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  on the way, because Pam Bondi wants to make sure everyone is treated fairly in this new [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=180.26s)]
*  Department of Justice, and that's what we're going to accomplish. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=185.98s)]
*  Yeah, the Jewish community is still very concerned about the way Jewish students, Jewish people [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=188.77999999999997s)]
*  in general, have been treated in this country over the last year. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=194.02s)]
*  I want to bring your attention and put up on the screen some statistics from a brand [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=197.78s)]
*  new study that's coming out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=202.34s)]
*  This is from the American Jewish Committee. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=203.94s)]
*  They're going to publish a study later this week. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=206.06s)]
*  Here are some of it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  This is the state of anti-Semitism in America. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=210.7s)]
*  Look at this. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=213.5s)]
*  90% of American Jews believe, they say, they believe anti-Semitism has increased since [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=214.5s)]
*  the October 7th tragedy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=221.7s)]
*  61% say anti-Semitism has increased a lot. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=223.94s)]
*  And then look at this next statistic here. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=228.18s)]
*  77% of American Jews, they feel less safe in the U.S., according to this study. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=230.78s)]
*  Leo, when you look at these numbers, these numbers are overwhelming. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=237.5s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=242.82s)]
*  I find them offensive, and I'll tell you right now, those numbers are supported, Anita, by [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=244.18s)]
*  FBI numbers that I've seen. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=248.18s)]
*  That October 7 massacre is the situation that prompted these increased numbers. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=250.26s)]
*  But I can't stress it enough. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=256.42s)]
*  This is going to stop immediately because the Department of Justice, again, Pam Bondi, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=258.21999999999997s)]
*  have said everything we have to use to stop this and deter this conduct is going to happen. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=263.86s)]
*  And it's going to happen now. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=269.94s)]
*  And I tell you right now, that is a joint task force by all agencies in the government [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  to stop anti-Semitism. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=277.82s)]
*  And Leo, while I have you here, I just want to ask you very quickly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=280.1s)]
*  President Trump says he plans to create a White House faith office while directing Attorney [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=283.66s)]
*  General Pam Bondi to lead a task force aimed to eliminate what he called anti-Christian [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=288.54s)]
*  bias within the federal government. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=293.7s)]
*  In the last 20 seconds, what can you tell us about that? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=296.18s)]
*  Let me tell you right now, everyone in this country knows that one of the greatest things [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=299.1s)]
*  about this country is the fundamental right of free expression and free religion, freedom [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=301.86s)]
*  of religion. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=306.66s)]
*  And what has happened in the last three or four years? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=307.66s)]
*  Many of the Christian Catholics have been basically attacked by this government. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=309.58s)]
*  We're going to stop it. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  And that's why President Trump tasked Pam Bondi to take care of it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  And I can assure you, knowing Pam, we're going to use all the tools in the toolbox to address [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=318.02s)]
*  this bias against Christians, Catholics, all religions, Anita. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=322.94s)]
*  Everyone should be treated fairly and equally. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=327.74s)]
*  And that's one of the reasons why I'm proud to work in the Department of Justice. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=329.53999999999996s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=332.7s)]
*  Leo Turrell, in his first appearance, as he is in his new job with the Department of Justice [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=333.7s)]
*  in the Civil Rights Division. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=339.14s)]
*  Leo, great to see you. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=340.5s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Anita. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=344.65999999999997s)]
*  Mike? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ihe4kSzBLk8&t=345.65999999999997s)]
