# Biden has lost his capability to deter Iran: Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU)
*  Well, the president's response to this, as Jennifer outlined, was don't. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=0.0s)]
*  And we have heard that a couple of times from this commander-in-chief. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=3.36s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=6.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin is becoming embarrassed and pushed into a corner. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=7.76s)]
*  And I wonder, Mr. President, what you would say to him if he is considering using chemical [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=13.84s)]
*  or tactical nuclear weapons. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=19.88s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=22.12s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=23.12s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=24.12s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=25.12s)]
*  Don't. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=26.12s)]
*  General Jack Keene, what do you think? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=27.12s)]
*  Well, I mean, that's not much of a policy, don't. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=29.12s)]
*  And we've obviously lost our deterrence capability under this administration time and time again. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=32.120000000000005s)]
*  I mean, the reality of Iran finally is center in the picture here, in a sense, is welcome [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  news because it reminds us how everything got started here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=46.52s)]
*  They green-lighted the ground invasion into Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  And they operationalized every single one of their proxies to coordinate an axis of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=56.12s)]
*  resistance against Israel or against U.S. presence in the region. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=63.12s)]
*  All of that took place because Iran wanted it to take place, and also they provided the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=67.12s)]
*  support for it, the training for it, and as we know, they've assisted in the planning [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=75.12s)]
*  for it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=80.12s)]
*  So this is the reality of what we're dealing with, and this administration has lost their [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=82.12s)]
*  capability to deter Iran. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=87.12s)]
*  As a matter of fact, one of the very frustrating things, not publicly disclosed, is how frustrated [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=89.12s)]
*  the Israeli political and military leadership is with the administration over Iran because [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=95.12s)]
*  they believe there needs a major effort to deter Iran's aggression in the region, and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=101.12s)]
*  yet this administration for three years has put diplomacy and appeasement first despite [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=107.12s)]
*  the increasing aggression that Iran has displayed. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=113.12s)]
*  And that is one of the reasons why we're really in this situation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=117.12s)]
*  I will say this, Neil, I know everybody's spun up over the fact that Iran is going to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=121.12s)]
*  do something and it's likely imminent, but let's keep this in focus. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=128.12s)]
*  Iran does not want to get into a conflict with Israel or the United States. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=135.12s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=141.12s)]
*  Their military is absolutely not prepared for anything like that. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=142.12s)]
*  Air Force, Navy, relatively weak. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=147.12s)]
*  Army, while they have a lot of numbers, not particularly well-trained, not particularly [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=149.12s)]
*  well-equipped. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=154.12s)]
*  They put most of their money into offensive missiles and drones, and the overwhelming [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=155.12s)]
*  majority of their money goes to their who? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=161.12s)]
*  The proxies to conduct offensive operations for them. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=164.12s)]
*  Likely, certainly a response by Iran because all the international visibility attack on [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=168.12s)]
*  the IRGC headquarters in Damascus. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=174.12s)]
*  So, there will be a response, but Iran does not want this escalated to conflict. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=177.12s)]
*  We are showing some video of that attack and the aftermath of that attack at that consulate. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=183.12s)]
*  To your point, General, we're learning separately, General, that the United States has been working [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=187.12s)]
*  the angle of China to see if they can tell Iran not to retaliate. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=193.12s)]
*  How effective do you think that will be? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=198.12s)]
*  I don't think not much. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=204.12s)]
*  Obviously, China has a role to play in the Middle East and they certainly want the flow [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=206.12s)]
*  of oil to take place. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=211.12s)]
*  I don't think they've ever agreed with Iran's goals to dominate and control the Middle East [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=212.12s)]
*  and control the flow of oil. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=216.12s)]
*  The United States has reached out to all the Arab nations, certainly in the region, to Turkey [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=218.12s)]
*  and to others to try to convince Iran not to do that. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=224.12s)]
*  That's fine, but Iran is going to make the call here themselves based on their own national [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=228.12s)]
*  interest, and they have certainly acted as independent actors in the past, and I think that's [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=234.12s)]
*  what we're going to get here. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=241.12s)]
*  The guy in charge of this, the supreme leader, is making this decision just as he made the [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=243.12s)]
*  decision to go ahead with the ground invasion into Israel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=248.12s)]
*  General, hopefully cooler heads prevail here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=253.12s)]
*  General Jack Keene, always good seeing you, my friend, and thank you. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=255.12s)]
*  Have a safe weekend. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nytcqi3EDmU&t=258.12s)]
