# Biden fires back at Trump over Iran: Quit blaming Obama
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 09, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k)
*  16 past the hour now Joe Biden now hitting the current strategy in Iran tweeting this instead of using his statement today to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=0.0s)]
*  Lay out a coherent strategy in Iran Donald Trump used it to mislead the country on the Obama Biden record [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=6.72s)]
*  He's been president for three years this time [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=13.22s)]
*  He stopped blaming President Obama for his failures Dan Henninger deputy editor Wall Street Journal with me now Dan. How you doing? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=15.08s)]
*  Good morning. We're only in this mess because Donald Trump pulled out of the Iran deal to that you say what well, I think [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  You know Joe Biden keeps wrapping himself in Barack Obama as something of a security blanket and eventually he's going to have to start [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=29.1s)]
*  Proposing his own candidacy rather than Obama's candidacy, and I think there may be a political reason for this [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=38.02s)]
*  Joe Biden is currently running in the primaries. He has a lot of support from black Democrats [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  He has to win the South Carolina primary we get that but there's a point beyond which Joe Biden has to be running his own [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=47.7s)]
*  Campaign and engage with President Trump on the substance of what is going on in Iran [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=53.98s)]
*  And I don't think there's any question that the Iranians use the money from the Iran deal that the Obama administration [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=59.58s)]
*  Sent them to buy and develop these missiles and also the destabilization that has been going on in [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=65.5s)]
*  In the Middle East since then came in the wake of the Iran nuclear deal [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=72.34s)]
*  So Joe Biden at some point is going to have to talk about what President Trump is actually doing and it's not [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=76.98s)]
*  It's clearly not the case as of yesterday that there is no plan the president addressed the nation [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=83.9s)]
*  He said he's willing to talk to the Iranians [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=89.18s)]
*  Their foreign minister's are Eve himself responded that the missiles that they had sent over there was a proportionate response [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=91.78s)]
*  So it looks like we are at the brink here of a possibility of a negotiation [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=97.9s)]
*  That is a strategy and Joe Biden's got to start talking about that if it is a general election [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=101.94s)]
*  campaign as Trump versus by and this is a [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=106.86000000000001s)]
*  Clear difference of opinion now in foreign policy you write this today Wall Street Journal [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=109.86s)]
*  Dan Henninger says Joe Biden's it turns policy stop Trump Democratic Party's national security strategy is where it was in [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=114.26s)]
*  1972 a year their candidate lost big here's the line I picked out a byproduct of mr. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=121.7s)]
*  Trump's maddening personas that it causes his opponents to lose their ability to think straight about [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=127.06s)]
*  Anything why'd you write that I wrote that because I was struck as was former [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=133.9s)]
*  Democratic senator Joe Lieberman who wrote on the editorial page [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=138.85999999999999s)]
*  This week that the Democrats are running the risk as looking as though [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=142.29999999999998s)]
*  they simply will not any longer use force in foreign affairs and [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=146.62s)]
*  I was reminded the fact that years ago there used to be national security [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=151.78s)]
*  Democrats like Joe Lieberman or Sam nun who understood the idea of having a credible deterrent force [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=155.85999999999999s)]
*  Which means the willingness to use military force against provocations by adversaries [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  In the Cold War it was the Soviet Union now [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=168.54s)]
*  It is Iran and the response of the Democrats to the killing of Soleimani seemed to fall into two paths of [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=171.54s)]
*  Proposition one that we were on the brink of war and the only alternative to that was as Joe Biden said Tuesday only [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=179.34s)]
*  Diplomacy in other words [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=186.94s)]
*  There's no middle way in their view anymore and this struck me as being basically the kind of anti-war proposition [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=188.18s)]
*  That senator George McGovern made in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=195.5s)]
*  1972 when his campaign got completely wiped out by Richard Nixon in that November [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=198.5s)]
*  You're saying two things there the moderate Democratic position. No more is the headline [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=204.22s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you're saying and we can't even see what it is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean moderates like Joe Biden Amy Klobuchar [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=211.26s)]
*  Seem to be saying that they are unwilling to use force and I think the defining event was in 2012 [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=214.5s)]
*  Remember when Barack Obama drew the red line in the sand against Assad's use of chemical weapons in Syria and then did nothing [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=220.3s)]
*  When Assad used those chemical weapons, so that's a proposition of diplomacy only [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=227.4s)]
*  And I think the Democrats are very vulnerable [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=233.34s)]
*  By showing that they are unwilling to use a credible deterrent force as I believe the president just did by killing Soleimani [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=235.58s)]
*  Nixon blew out McGovern in 1972. Yeah, is that a prediction? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=242.3s)]
*  I think we could be heading in that direction [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=246.61999999999998s)]
*  Unless the Democrats in the face of the national security problems [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=249.57999999999998s)]
*  We're seeing right now begin to act as though they could be entrusted with the nation's security. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  Dan Henninger, thank you. Interesting piece Wall Street Journal. Nice to see you. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g345ClaY0-k&t=258.65999999999997s)]
