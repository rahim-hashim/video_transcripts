# Former Green Beret: Biden admin is sending a weak message
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 03, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY)
*  So the White House says these attacks tonight are by no means an act of war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=0.0s)]
*  What does that mean? Well, let's bring it former Green Beret, Michael Glover. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=5.04s)]
*  Michael, thank you for being here. Um, you heard what the White House has to [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=8.36s)]
*  say. This is every time they speak about striking an enemy and now in response [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=12.56s)]
*  to the death of our troops, they say, but we don't want to, we don't want [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=17.56s)]
*  conflict. We don't want conflict. What kind of message is this White House [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=19.6s)]
*  sending? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=22.16s)]
*  Yeah, it's a weak one. I mean, we've been advertising this for almost a week [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  now. It's given the enemy plenty of time to get all the players out and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=28.28s)]
*  essentially hit empty containers in the middle of the desert also put our [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=33.88s)]
*  troops at further risk. And that's a problem. I mean, now the enemy has the [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=38.400000000000006s)]
*  will and now incentive to get further involved. It's the same thing that just [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  happened with the Houthis. We thought those attacks were going to suppress [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=46.64s)]
*  them and they continue to attack because they do have that will. And now [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=49.900000000000006s)]
*  they have an incentive. We're not. He said directly, we do not seek further [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=53.94s)]
*  conflict. This is exactly what he's doing. So in search of deterrence, we're [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=58.58s)]
*  definitely going to get more conflict because our messages are confusing and [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=64.22s)]
*  our response is insufficient. And oh, by the way, we're already playing footsie [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=69.14s)]
*  with Iran and we somehow think they can be our friend. Is there anything to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=73.7s)]
*  salvage out of this? Like how? How could you play it forward so that we don't [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=77.78s)]
*  get dragged into something deeper here? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=81.82s)]
*  Well, I hate to say it because not a lot of people are, but you have to address [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=84.94s)]
*  the cancer that it is instead of the symptoms that we continue to do. It's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=88.98s)]
*  like putting up band aids on hatchet. It's like Iran is the problem. When me [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=92.78s)]
*  and you were overseas fighting, we were fighting Shia backed militias that were [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=97.98s)]
*  backed by Iran and they were killing a lot of our brothers and sisters in arms. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=103.82s)]
*  We took Mukhtar Sartar off the off the hit list and we decided to play a [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=108.1s)]
*  diplomatic game. I'm all about diplomacy here, but the left hand is not [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=112.14s)]
*  talking to the right and we're shooting missiles into the dark. Some of these [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=116.42s)]
*  organizations that have been targeted, I guarantee, like Joe Kent said on his [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=119.5s)]
*  twitter have been funded and trained by American forces. It's U. S. Tax [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=123.54s)]
*  payers for U. S. Taxpayers to be annihilated, which is just further [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=127.9s)]
*  increasing issues on the ground. You're exactly right. The only way you can [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=133.02s)]
*  have diplomacy. I agree diplomacy is what we should want is if you're holding [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=136.76s)]
*  a gun in the other hand saying, Hey, let's cut this deal because it's a [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=140.5s)]
*  deal you're gonna take and it's a deal that works for us, especially in a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=143.42s)]
*  neighborhood of the world that only respects strength. You're exactly right. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=146.74s)]
*  Appreciate your time. Thank you, sir. And for your service, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=150.54s)]
*  you got it. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSIaL9edMIY&t=155.34s)]
