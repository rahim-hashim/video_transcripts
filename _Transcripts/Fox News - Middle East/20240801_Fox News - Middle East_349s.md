# Level 4 Advisory: State Department warns Americans against traveling to Lebanon
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk)
*  The State Department has issued a Level 4 warning, its highest against Americans traveling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=0.0s)]
*  to Lebanon as tensions rise in the Middle East. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=5.14s)]
*  That Level 4 advisory was issued following back-to-back strikes, presumably by Israel, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=8.34s)]
*  that killed Taft Hezbollah and Hamas terror leaders. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=14.42s)]
*  Retired U.S. four-star Army General Jack Keen is here. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=17.26s)]
*  In terms of the death of Ismail Haniyeh in downtown Tehran, some new information came [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=19.94s)]
*  out that I find absolutely fascinating in general. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=26.38s)]
*  And that is that he was killed by a bomb that was planted in the guesthouse in which he [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=29.16s)]
*  was staying months ago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=34.78s)]
*  That guesthouse is run by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=36.84s)]
*  Does this smell of an inside job? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=42.58s)]
*  Well, John, you're getting at something that's pretty sensitive, and that is the fact that [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=45.74s)]
*  there's been two dozen-plus attacks going back 12 to 15 years, conducting espionage [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=53.26s)]
*  operations inside of Iran. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=61.92s)]
*  And just about every single one of those operations, with some exceptions, have had Iranian dissidents [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=65.42s)]
*  working with the Mossad in executing those operations. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=71.16s)]
*  And this is a partnership that they've established through the years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=75.78s)]
*  The success that Mossad has had inside Iran is, John, it's absolutely stunning what they've [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=79.5s)]
*  been able to do, from going all the way back just a few years to 2018, when they took the [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=85.78s)]
*  warehouse down with all of the nuclear secrets and in truckloads of information right out [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=92.26s)]
*  of Tehran itself. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=99.64s)]
*  In 2021, they took the Natanz nuclear facility down, all the centrifuges they blew up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=102.22s)]
*  They've conducted cyber attacks. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=108.34s)]
*  And in 2022, later in that year, they sent six quadruple drones, and it took down hundreds [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=110.7s)]
*  of drones at a manufacturing base in western Iran. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=117.64s)]
*  This has been going on to include killing nuclear scientists, engineers, and military [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=122.92s)]
*  officials. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=128.22s)]
*  They do this in cooperation with Iranian dissidents, who help them with information and sometimes [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=129.44s)]
*  help them also with execution. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=135.26s)]
*  So inside job, absolutely likely the case here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=138.38s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=143.42s)]
*  General, welcome to you. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=144.42s)]
*  We know through Anthony Blinken, we continue to hear that the goals are ceasefire. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=145.57999999999998s)]
*  They believe that they are working towards a deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=150.14s)]
*  Where do you see this going next, General? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=152.82s)]
*  Well, it's hard to believe that they're getting close to a deal, given what's taken place. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=155.94s)]
*  And I absolutely applaud up front here, the Israeli government taking down Hezbollah [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=161.9s)]
*  military commander, Hamas military commander, and Hamas's political chieftain, who was intimately [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=168.42000000000002s)]
*  involved in those negotiations. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=175.86s)]
*  We have got to hold these leaders accountable. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=178.06s)]
*  Israel is doing exactly the right thing here. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  I do think it's going to have some impact on negotiations for sure. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=183.26s)]
*  Benoit, who is really the decision maker on the Hamas side, has been holding back. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=189.1s)]
*  And the reason he's holding back is he thinks protraction and time is on his side, condemnation [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=195.54s)]
*  of Israel on the rise, isolation of Israel on the rise, President of the United States [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=201.54s)]
*  and others in the administration wire brushing Israel in public, holding back weapons and [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=206.14s)]
*  munitions. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=211.38s)]
*  Why would you not think that that is in your favor? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=212.57999999999998s)]
*  And that's where we've been. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=216.24s)]
*  So I'm not certain there's anything close to happening. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=217.92s)]
*  We've had, we've said that before and it just hasn't happened. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=221.76s)]
*  So in response to the takeouts of Shukr and Haneeh, both Iran and Hezbollah are vowing [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=225.04s)]
*  that they will launch retaliatory strikes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham says if they do that, the United States needs to hit Iran itself. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=234.68s)]
*  Listen to what he said. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=239.88s)]
*  Not only should Israel hold Iran accountable for any escalation by Hezbollah, the United [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=242.04s)]
*  States should do the same. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=249.48s)]
*  What should the target list include? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=251.92s)]
*  It should include those facilities most vital to the funding of terrorism. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  It should include refineries. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=260.15999999999997s)]
*  You and he appear to be on the same page, General. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=262.76s)]
*  Well listen, the commander of Central Command, Eric Carrillo, has submitted requests time [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=267.24s)]
*  and time again to the administration to get permission to push back on the Houthis, not [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=272.6s)]
*  just defensively, which we're doing, is defend against missile and rocket attacks or take [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=278.96000000000004s)]
*  down their launcher systems inside Yemen, but go after the source, the spy ship that's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=283.62s)]
*  in the Red Sea providing the targeting for the Houthis, the Navy ships that are transporting [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=288.46000000000004s)]
*  the missiles and rockets and munitions, go after these targets. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=295.04s)]
*  Over 100 targets have been submitted inside Iran, just military targets, not even a commercial [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=298.24s)]
*  target like Senator Graham is talking about, or all refineries. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=304.16s)]
*  All of them rejected. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=308.40000000000003s)]
*  I don't think anything like that will be approved by this administration. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=309.40000000000003s)]
*  It is strategic failure on a part of the administration that we don't hold the architect of what has [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=313.16s)]
*  taken place in the Middle East. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=318.92s)]
*  The chaos and destability is organized and supervised by Iran, and the fact that we don't [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=321.34s)]
*  hold them accountable leads to more aggression, and that is where we are. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=327.38s)]
*  General Akin, it's always great to have you on. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=332.5s)]
*  Thank you very much, sir. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=334.0s)]
*  Thanks, General. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=335.0s)]
*  Yeah, great talking to you. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PLyfIknNXk&t=336.0s)]
