*  The President has been closely monitoring the situation in California over the past several [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=11.84s)]
*  weeks and is being regularly briefed by his Homeland Security team throughout this time. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=17.12s)]
*  He has remained in close touch with the Governor and also local officials on the ground. As you [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=22.96s)]
*  all saw President Biden approved Governor Newsom's request for an expedited major disaster [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=28.88s)]
*  declaration Saturday evening providing federal support for debris removal, emergency protective [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=34.4s)]
*  measures and individual assistance to survey whose homes have been damaged or destroyed by [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=40.48s)]
*  the storm. And we have over 500 FEMA and other federal personnel have already deployed to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=47.44s)]
*  California to support response and recovery operations and are working side by side with [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=53.36s)]
*  the state to ensure all needs are indeed met on the ground. This Sunday the White House will [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=60.08s)]
*  commemorate what would have been the 50th anniversary of Roe v Wade. Vice President [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=66.48s)]
*  Harris will travel to Florida to deliver a major address on the fight for women across America to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=71.28s)]
*  have access to reproductive care and make their own health care decisions. 50 years after the [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=79.12s)]
*  Supreme Court's 1973 decision in Roe v Wade, ultra-maga Republican officials continue to push [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  at all levels of government for extreme legislation rolling back women's fundamental rights, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=93.12s)]
*  including a national abortion ban. At the state level more than 60 anti-choice bills have been [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  produced for the 2023 legislative session, including extreme proposals going as far as [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=106.24s)]
*  threatening women with felony charges for accessing care. In stark contrast, the President [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=114.16s)]
*  and the Vice President remain committed to fighting these extreme attacks on women and [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=120.24s)]
*  expanding access to reproductive care however they possibly can. This Sunday the President will [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=124.56s)]
*  speak about the fight to secure women's fundamental right to reproductive health care in the face of [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=130.88s)]
*  these attacks. She will talk about what's at stake for millions of women across the country and most [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=136.16s)]
*  importantly the need for Congress to codify the protections of Roe into law. The President and the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=141.92s)]
*  Vice President and a strong majority of the American people believe that women must be empowered to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  make decisions about their own lives and health care and that those decisions should not should [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=157.6s)]
*  never be should not be politicized or second guessed by politicians. Unfortunately that is [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=164.08s)]
*  exactly what Republican officials are doing in Congress. Despite the outcome of the midterm [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=170.88000000000002s)]
*  elections in which millions of Americans went to the polls just across the country to protect [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=176.56s)]
*  women's constitutional rights and reject extreme proposal to sell out the middle class, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=181.44s)]
*  we have seen House Republicans abuse their narrow majority to take aim at the very issues [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=186.72000000000003s)]
*  the American people care about the most. In addition to attacking women's health care, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=193.6s)]
*  we've already seen House Republicans try and undercut the progress President Biden [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=199.04s)]
*  has made rebuilding the economy from the bottom up and the middle out. Today we get we got our [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=204.32s)]
*  news of even more progress tackling inflation bringing costs down for Americans. Both producer [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=210.24s)]
*  and consumer inflation has fallen has now fallen for about six months straight and consumer spending [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=216.8s)]
*  remains strong with retail sales in December about flat when adjusted for inflation. That adds up to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=224.08s)]
*  historic progress President Biden inherited an economic crisis and turned it into the strongest [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=231.44s)]
*  two years of job growth on record. The United States just hit the lowest unemployment rate in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=237.44s)]
*  50 years because of his economic plan. Again his economic plan for the American people is indeed [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=244.24s)]
*  working. But as President is fighting as he is fighting to bring costs down more and ensure [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=250.72s)]
*  that middle class families get a fair shake, House Republicans are advancing an economic plan that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=257.36s)]
*  will take tax cuts for the rich, higher prices and cutting social media as pardon me cutting [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=264.32s)]
*  social social security and cutting Medicare as well. Their very first vote of the new Congress [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=272.4s)]
*  was a bill to worsen inflation and tax welfare for the rich. They want to impose an unprecedented tax [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=280.32s)]
*  increase on middle class families in the form of a 23% sales tax in order to provide even more tax [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=289.28s)]
*  giveaways to the super rich and big corporations. They're going to vote to raise gas prices and [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=296.0s)]
*  deprive Americans of relief at the pump and they're threatening to kill millions of jobs and and 401k [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=302.64s)]
*  plans by trying to hold the debt limit hostage unless they can again cut social security, cut [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=310.32s)]
*  Medicare, cut Medicaid. So on this last point the President has been clear he will not allow [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=318.08s)]
*  Republicans to take the economy hostage or make working Americans pay the price for their schemes [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=325.12s)]
*  to benefit the wealthiest Americans and also special interest. With that I say this all the time [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=333.76s)]
*  Josh I haven't seen you in a long time and you always tell me you've been here. Okay hi good to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=339.76s)]
*  see you Josh. Kick us off please. Given everything you just laid out with regard to House Republicans [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=346.0s)]
*  what is the White House seen or heard from House Republicans that gives you confidence that we can [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=352.32s)]
*  avoid a default? Look we've been very very clear and I'll say this again. Let me first say let me [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=358.8s)]
*  first say this part that after after the midterm elections the President was very clear after we [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=365.44s)]
*  saw a historic kind of a historic historic when it comes to a Democratic President in in 60 years [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=371.52s)]
*  being able to you know to have a successful midterm when you look at what we saw in the Senate and we [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=381.44s)]
*  look at the red wave that never happened the President said you know the the American people [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=389.03999999999996s)]
*  spoke very loudly and very clearly they want to see us work in a bipartisan way so the President [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=394.4s)]
*  wants to do that he's looking to do that but also when you think about the debt limit it is [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  you know we've been very clear the debt limit has been something that has happened three times if [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=406.4s)]
*  you look at just the last administration in a bipartisan way it is something that should be [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=411.52s)]
*  happen that should be done without conditions there should be we should not be negotiating [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=416.4s)]
*  around it it is the it is the duty the basic duty of Congress to get that done and so we're not going [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=421.28s)]
*  to we're just not going to negotiate about that because again it was done under the last President [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=430.32s)]
*  it was done three times again in a bipartisan what our bipartisan way this is there is no [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=437.2s)]
*  alternative to Congress responsibility here to address the debt ceiling Treasury makes millions [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=442.56s)]
*  of payments each day their system is built to pay our country's bills on time it's not set to make [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=449.2s)]
*  the United States delinquent by paying our bills there is a reason that Treasury Secretaries of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=455.12s)]
*  both parties if you think about it if you all remember rejected this incredible risky and [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=461.59999999999997s)]
*  dangerous idea that has never been tried before so it is essential for Congress to recognize that [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  dealing with the debt ceiling is their constitutional responsibility this is an easy one this is something [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=472.64s)]
*  that should be happening without conditions just to make sure I understand do you think [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=479.04s)]
*  House Republicans in this Congress see their responsibilities the way that you just outlined [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=486.48s)]
*  they should I just laid out why they should they should have the they should feel the responsibility [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=492.24s)]
*  and I talked about this yesterday I quoted the Chamber of Commerce said it would have [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=497.12s)]
*  catastrophic economic consequences a former economist to Republican Senators Rob Portman [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  Marco Rubio Mitt Romney called it a really bad idea and disaster and in 2011 then Treasury [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=507.52s)]
*  Secretary Tim Geithner called it unworkable and harmful it is it is the precedent has been for [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=515.28s)]
*  both parties to come together and to get this done we are talking about the the full the full [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=522.8s)]
*  and credit of our country and then secondly real fast help us understand given the frequency with [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=530.4s)]

*  Hi Corrine good afternoon thank you I'd like to turn your attention to Nigeria just a few days [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=673.44s)]
*  ago an absolutely horrific story a Catholic priest in his rectory early Sunday morning [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=678.64s)]
*  was literally burned to death bandits burned the rectory and today as a matter of fact Pope [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=684.24s)]
*  Francis asked the world to pray for Father Isaac Achi question one two questions here one [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=690.64s)]
*  will the biden administration forcefully condemn acts of violence against Christians in Nigeria? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=696.8s)]
*  So let me just say we are saddened by the senseless killing uh the we have seen the [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=702.8s)]
*  reports and we're certainly are saddened by that we are monitoring the situation [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=707.76s)]
*  as information develops and so we hope the Nigerian authorities will quickly bring the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=712.3199999999999s)]
*  perpetrators to justice and of course we condemn violence of any kind and so that is something that [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=717.52s)]
*  you've heard me say many times from this podium and that is something that we will continue to [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=725.12s)]
*  condemn. Just a follow-up on that how many more Nigerian priests have to be so brutally murdered [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=729.04s)]
*  before Nigeria is placed back on the countries of particular concern list you know the state [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=737.28s)]

*  bipartisan cooperation to address the debt ceiling and that's how it should be it should not be used [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=843.4399999999999s)]

*  and the senate democrats to take up first? So let me just say we certainly welcome and appreciate [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=888.72s)]
*  Senator Schumer's supportive comments this weekend as you just mentioned and look forward to working [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=893.76s)]

*  legal this ongoing legal process. Anything specific dealing with this dealing with this [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1507.76s)]
*  with this issue I would refer to the Department of Justice or the special council and I'll leave it [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1514.4s)]
*  there. Okay I'll come I'll come down I'll come down. The White House today put out this really [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1519.52s)]
*  sharply written statement about the committee assignments the oversight committee assignments [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1526.32s)]
*  Marge Taylor Greene representative Gosar representative Bovert getting his assignments [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1530.8s)]
*  on the oversight committee of the statements that handing the keys of oversight to the most extreme [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1535.04s)]
*  MAGA members in the Republican caucus who promote violent rhetoric and dangerous conspiracy theories. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1538.8799999999999s)]
*  Given this statement does the White House view the oversight committee as even legitimate? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1544.3999999999999s)]
*  So look I've been very clean I just said this moments ago the president intends to work with [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1548.0s)]
*  both parties in good faith if they choose to and make more progress on on behalf of the American [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1553.76s)]
*  people. He has said this we will continue to say this but unfortunately to your point Mary [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1559.92s)]
*  on some of these key committees it appears that house republicans have handed over the keys to [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1564.96s)]
*  the most extreme MAGA members of the Republican caucus. This is what we're seeing from the other [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1570.16s)]
*  side of Pennsylvania of Pennsylvania Avenue. These are members who have promoted violent [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1576.48s)]
*  rhetoric and dangerous conspiracy theories including suggesting violence against political [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1580.72s)]
*  opponents trafficking in anti-semitic lies and defending and downplaying a violent insurrection [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1586.16s)]
*  against our democracy. You all many of you covered what we saw in January 6, 2021 and so Republican [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1592.16s)]
*  leaders should explain they should have to explain not us they should have to explain why allowing [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1599.52s)]
*  these individuals to serve on these committees and come clean with the American people about the [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1604.96s)]
*  the secret agreements the secret deals that were made with these extreme MAGA MAGA extremists in [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1610.0s)]
*  that are currently in in the house and so that is something for them to respond to that is some [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1616.96s)]
*  that question goes to them. Sounds like you don't view the committee as very I I did not say that [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1622.8s)]
*  I laid out I laid out what the president intends to do I laid out what what unfortunately with [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1627.6s)]
*  the actions that they have taken how unfortunate it is to basically hand over the keys to some of [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1636.32s)]
*  the most extreme people in the in the Republican party the MAGA ultra MAGA Republicans and what [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1642.64s)]
*  they've done but it is not for me to answer that question it is for them to answer why is it that [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1650.8s)]
*  they chose to move in that direction. And can I just follow up what you just said earlier about [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1656.48s)]
*  the president being surprised the documents were even there that he said multiple times you've said [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1660.88s)]
*  again he was unaware that these classified documents were even in his garage in his [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1665.44s)]
*  residence given that given that that you could actually just be surprised that documents were [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1670.8s)]
*  there does that suggest to you to this White House that reform is needed there needs to be changes [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1676.24s)]
*  for how classified documents are tracked for the U.S. government. I'm not I'm not in a position to [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1682.3200000000002s)]
*  talk about reform or how this process should go forward what I will say is this is something [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1687.8400000000001s)]
*  that's being reviewed by the Department of Justice I would refer you to them I would [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1692.96s)]
*  refer you to the special counsel I'm just not going to go any further than that. Okay. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1696.72s)]
*  Thank you so much I would have two questions one is Ukraine one on the economy. On Ukraine [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1702.08s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal and the German newspapers with the digit siting are now reporting that the [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1708.64s)]
*  Germans won't provide signs for Ukraine unless the U.S. does exactly the same so this seems to be a [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1713.52s)]
*  kind of deadlock situation here what's the administration doing about it? So I was asked [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1721.2s)]
*  this question yesterday when it comes to the U.S. we're in constant communication with Ukraine and [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1726.56s)]
*  we'll continue to provide them with what they need as they defend themselves against Russian aggression [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1732.96s)]
*  and against this brutal war that we have seen from Russia for almost a year now but I don't have any [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1737.92s)]
*  new announcements to share of any types of security assistance to preview look when it comes to [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1744.4s)]
*  when it comes to other countries the president believes that each country [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1750.08s)]
*  should make their own sovereign decisions on what steps of security assistance and what kinds of [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1754.4799999999998s)]
*  equipment they are able to provide Ukraine as again Ukraine defends itself against Russian [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1759.4399999999998s)]
*  aggression so for instance we welcome Germany's recent announcement that they will send infantry [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1765.1999999999998s)]
*  fighting vehicles and a patriot missiles battery system to Ukraine we also support the decision [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1771.4399999999998s)]
*  by the UK over the weekend to send challenger tanks to Ukraine and we have seen incredible [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1776.24s)]
*  solidarity by nations around the world to support Ukraine so but it's not for us to speak to that [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1782.08s)]
*  is there each country's decision to make that to make their own sovereign decisions on this [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1788.48s)]
*  as it relates to the U.S. we have been as you know the largest provider of security assistance of [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1794.48s)]
*  humanitarian aid we will we will be standing by with the Ukrainian people and and helping them [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1800.48s)]
*  in any way that they that we can to defend themselves until you know until throughout [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1807.44s)]
*  throughout this process but I don't have any announcements to make at this time the president [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1813.2s)]
*  has been like quite optimistic in his latest statements about you know the possibility of [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1818.72s)]
*  a soft landing for the economy but at the same time we also have like a massive layer of announcements [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1823.3600000000001s)]
*  like microsoft just today is this a matter of concern for the white house so that is something [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1829.52s)]
*  as you know that we watch closely anytime there are reports of Americans losing their jobs [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1836.32s)]
*  president biden knows firsthand the impact of losing a job and what that can have to your entire [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1843.6s)]
*  family this is something that he knows and understands very well I don't have a comment [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1848.96s)]
*  on specific moves announced by particular companies as you know we are we are very careful [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1853.12s)]
*  from here talking about private companies but more broadly speaking layoffs remain near record [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1858.24s)]
*  lows according to job openings data we found that we found out this week that 10 million new [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1862.96s)]
*  small businesses have been created since president biden took office I talked about this from this [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1868.72s)]
*  podium just yesterday and similarly third quarter GDP revision shows that the U.S. economy continues [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1872.88s)]
*  to grow and add jobs we've also seen companies like TSMC IBM and Hyundai announced [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1879.04s)]
*  Hyundai announced new investments doubling down on building technologies of the future like chips [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1887.52s)]
*  and AI and electric vehicles in the U.S. companies across the economy are continuing to grow and [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1894.56s)]
*  invest in the United States but again of course this is something that we watch very closely [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1900.3999999999999s)]
*  okay go ahead Sabrina thank you so much and welcome back thank you China reported that its [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1906.56s)]
*  economic growth fell to three percent last year and its population dropped for the first time [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1912.8s)]
*  since 1961 is the administration concerned about China's relative economic weakness and do you [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1917.36s)]
*  think that this raises the likelihood of an economic downturn in the U.S. and the global economy [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1923.04s)]
*  so look I'm not going to comment on how China handles its own economy but what we are focused [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1929.5200000000002s)]
*  on is our approach which has to ensure that the United States economy remains resilient [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1936.72s)]
*  and that's the president's focus and when we're talking about resilience we're talking about [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1943.3600000000001s)]
*  resilience in the face of global challenges and has helped spur a historic recovery that is what [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1946.88s)]
*  we have seen in this president's first two years as in the end of his administration we'll continue [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1952.32s)]
*  our work to make progress on reducing prices and investing in our infrastructure manufacturing and [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1958.24s)]
*  clean energy energy economy and so we of course monitor all global developments and we'll continue [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1963.9199999999998s)]
*  to stay in touch with our partners allies and key market sectors including China as you have have [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1969.4399999999998s)]
*  you have seen secretary Secretary Yellen is in is in China and she's going to be meeting with [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1975.28s)]
*  China's vice president on one Wednesday one Wednesday which is today and so again she's [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1980.72s)]
*  there currently right now in China and there have been more allegations about congressman George [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1986.56s)]
*  Santos's misuse of finances of course this is in addition to him fabricating key details of his [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1991.68s)]
*  background while running for office prompting more calls from both parties for his resignation [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=1996.8s)]
*  just wanted to check back in does the White House think he should resign so look we have [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2001.3600000000001s)]
*  we've said this before and I think I said it the the probably the first few days of this a minute [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2005.6s)]
*  of this new congress in this new year which is it is up to it is up to the Republican conference [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2011.68s)]
*  who have to decide what they owe the American people it is their decision to make on on what [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2018.96s)]
*  it means what they see as it relates to the terms of standards and service they have to decide that [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2024.3999999999999s)]
*  it is their conference he's part of their conference clearly but sadly we have seen that [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2031.68s)]
*  they feel they owe the American people when it comes to standards by the actions that they have [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2036.3200000000002s)]
*  taken on this particular individual look you know just looking at the committee that he has been [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2041.52s)]
*  assigned to when it comes to Biden's economic plan and when it comes to the announcement that [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2048.0s)]
*  I made yesterday when it comes to small business we have seen a business application with over 10 [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2052.96s)]
*  million new small businesses created under this leadership and so the president takes that very [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2058.24s)]
*  seriously he takes he takes build making sure that we're building an economy from the bottom [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2063.4399999999996s)]
*  up the middle out very seriously and you see that in every part of his policies and every economic [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2069.68s)]
*  policy that he pushes forward but again this is up to the Republican conference to show [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2075.6s)]
*  what they think they owe the American people so it's their decision to make [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2080.7999999999997s)]
*  Okay thank you Corrine just a quick follow-up on the economy and job cuts. Amazon announced 18,000 job cuts today [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2085.68s)]
*  Microsoft announced 10,000 job cuts today all these thousands of job cuts are coming on top of [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2093.84s)]
*  tens of thousands of jobs being cut across the tech sector and across sectors in corporate America [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2099.84s)]
*  obviously the White House and the administration like you just you know pointed out a couple of [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2105.68s)]
*  minutes ago still believes the economy is resilient does not expect it to slip into a recession [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2110.0s)]
*  but as we talk about mass layoffs and as the White House continues to point the strong economy and [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2115.52s)]
*  overall recovery in the labor market how do you expect some of these numbers and some of [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2121.6s)]
*  these statistics to impact that recovery in the coming months? So let me just be clear when you [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2126.56s)]
*  talk talk about recession and you talk about what we're seeing currently with the economy these are [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2130.48s)]
*  the data points right this is the data points are showing that this is not what we see what the [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2135.2799999999997s)]
*  economy is currently to a pre-recession or a recession I mean that is what the experts [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2140.72s)]
*  are saying as well and that's what the data points are proving with CPI today the consumer [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2146.48s)]
*  not CPI the PPI today we're seeing that inflation is actually indeed moderating and a lot of that is [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2151.68s)]
*  connected to the president's economic policies and so that is something that we're going to [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2157.8399999999997s)]
*  continue to highlight we're going to continue to point to the data not just our words but that's [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2163.12s)]
*  what the data is showing look again as I mentioned to your colleague I'm not going to comment [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2167.68s)]
*  specifically on what's currently happening with particular companies with private companies [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2172.96s)]
*  clearly we're closely monitoring but like I said the layoffs remain near record lows according to [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2179.2799999999997s)]
*  the job openings data again looking at the data looking at the numbers we found out again I talked [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2184.48s)]
*  about the small businesses 10 million new small businesses have been created since the president [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2190.24s)]
*  took office that matters those data points also matter the third quarter GDP revision shows that [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2194.96s)]
*  the US economy continues to grow and add jobs so that's what I will point you to in answering your [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2201.04s)]
*  question as I just laid out but again we are seeing an economy we're seeing the president's [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2206.88s)]
*  economic policy actually working and I think that's important as well is there more work to do [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2212.0s)]
*  always more work to do and you hear that from us as well so it's a more immediate concern from these [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2217.68s)]
*  what I'm saying is we're going to closely monitor this or you know we are always keeping an eye on [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2223.36s)]
*  these things but but these are private these are private companies that are making decisions and [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2228.96s)]
*  we're just not going to comment. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2234.56s)]
*  I have a quick one on China if I may you were talking about Secretary Yellen you know Treasury announced today that she's planning to go to China [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2236.1600000000003s)]
*  Secretary of State is planning to go to China the president met with Xi in Bali in November [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2243.92s)]
*  clearly there is some momentum in you know some sort of rebuilding of ties between the two nations [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2251.52s)]
*  going forward this year should we expect the administration and the White House to perhaps [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2258.8799999999997s)]
*  tone down its rhetoric against China and really focus on rebuilding the relationship between the two nations? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2262.7999999999997s)]
*  I think we've been very clear on our approach with China that hasn't changed we're looking for [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2268.16s)]
*  a competition right that's what we're that's what we that's how we see our relationship with China [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2272.48s)]
*  and you know that hasn't changed it's not going to change when we walked in when the president walked [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2277.92s)]
*  into the administration in 2021 is certainly not going to change in 2023. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2282.32s)]
*  Good Karen I actually have an answer for you on the question you asked me yesterday. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2287.36s)]
*  I was going to ask you this. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2292.0800000000004s)]
*  So I said I would say yes okay if you have a response. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2293.76s)]
*  This is the New Mexico I believe right okay so the allegations here are horrifying and shocking and [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2299.2000000000003s)]
*  it's a miracle that no one was hurt. The president has spoken out repeatedly and emphatically about [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2305.28s)]
*  how our nation rejects violence as a political tool that is a bedrock principle of our democracy. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2312.48s)]
*  It is important for leaders in both parties to reaffirm that particular that particularly as [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2320.1600000000003s)]
*  we've seen an increase in violent rhetoric and political violence like we've seen most recently [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2325.0400000000004s)]
*  again in New Mexico. This administration has also emphasized the dangerous ways in which [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2330.1600000000003s)]
*  conspiracy theories and disinformation can lead some individuals to violence. Again we urge leaders [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2334.64s)]
*  in both parties to reject lies and conspiracies and finally let me add it's worth emphasizing [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2340.48s)]
*  that those intending to use violence as a political tool often choose firearms to intimidate and [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2346.64s)]
*  inflict carnage and so that is why this administration has made strides to address firearms but also has [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2352.7999999999997s)]
*  urged more to be done against our it's horrifying and shocking and we're just glad that no one was hurt in this event. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2359.68s)]
*  And if I can also ask you I asked you last Friday and I know that there was a formal request from the WHCA [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2371.52s)]
*  to have Richard Solver come to the briefing and take questions. To follow up on that would you [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2378.0s)]
*  commit to having the White House counsel come here and take questions? [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2383.12s)]
*  That is something that I would refer you to the White House counsel's office. This is they have been engaged with all of you. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2386.48s)]
*  I know again they did a 45 minute call with many of if not you many of your colleagues somebody had [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2392.08s)]
*  somebody here had said 30 minutes but it was not it was actually 45 minutes they miscounted [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2398.64s)]
*  and so that was important they will continue to engage with all of you and so again I would [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2404.16s)]
*  refer you to the White House counsel's office on this and any specifics to the ongoing legal matter [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2409.04s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice. I'm happy I'm happy to pass it along. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2417.2s)]
*  Thank you. I have two questions one on NATO one on Belarus. There's an impasse between Sweden Finland and Turkey over [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2423.52s)]
*  Ankara's demands related to Sweden's and Finland's NATO accession so I'm wondering if you consider [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2433.44s)]
*  those demands reasonable and if not does the president consider Turkey a reliable NATO ally? [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2442.48s)]
*  And the second question on Belarus a trial of a prominent Polish-Belarusian activist [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2453.28s)]
*  has started in Belarus yesterday and he's facing 12 years in prison for just criticizing [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2459.44s)]
*  Lukashenko's regime. Can you comment on that and is there anything that the US can do to help [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2465.76s)]
*  to press Belarus on this? So let me just say that we do see Turkey as a reliable ally so I'll answer [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2472.96s)]
*  that question that you just asked me. Anything specific about the agreement and what's [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2483.04s)]
*  currently happening we would refer you to the Turkish government to speak on their own position [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2490.24s)]
*  that's not something that I will do for them I would not speak for them here. What I can say is [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2495.36s)]
*  that we have been a strong supporter of Finland and Sweden's applications for NATO membership and [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2499.36s)]
*  worked with the Senate to move quickly to ratify their applications. You saw you all were here and [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2504.16s)]
*  saw Finland and Sweden's leadership here with the president not too long ago. We have welcomed the [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2510.24s)]
*  rapid ratifications by our allies and we urge all remaining allies to complete their own ratification [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2516.0s)]
*  process as quickly as possible. To your question about Belarus so we condemn the regime's blatant [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2523.12s)]
*  attempts to intimidate and harass peaceful protesters members of the democratic oppositions [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2530.4799999999996s)]
*  journalists unionists activists human rights defenders and ordinary Belarusians. These [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2536.16s)]
*  politically motivated trials are just the latest examples of the regime's effort to intimidate [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2541.68s)]
*  and repress those who seek justice respect for human rights and democratic Belarus and a [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2548.24s)]
*  democratic Belarus I should say. To respond to these human rights abuses the state department [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2555.12s)]
*  recently took action to impose visa restrictions on 25 individuals for their involvement in [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2560.8s)]
*  undermining Belarus's democracy. The U.S. the United States stands firmly with Belarusian people [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2566.8s)]
*  and their democratic aspirations. I'm going to keep going. Thank you. To be clear my question [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2573.2000000000003s)]
*  about procedures here at the White House and not about anything specific related to the DOJ [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2579.92s)]
*  investigation. So I'm just wondering how this episode has prompted a review of the process in [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2585.6s)]
*  which staffers handle classified information and how they are turned over to national archives [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2592.72s)]
*  during a transition. And to be clear I'm going to refer you to the my colleagues at the White [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2599.8399999999997s)]
*  House counsel's office they will be able to address that particular questions. I'm just not going to [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2604.4s)]
*  address something that is even related to an ongoing legal process. I mean I'm having a hard [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2609.92s)]
*  time understanding why I just said questions about we shall see. And I just said and I just [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2616.56s)]
*  said to you the White House counsel's office will be able to address that question. Is President [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2622.16s)]
*  Biden satisfied with the current SOP of handling classified materials here and turning them over [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2626.88s)]
*  to national archives? Again I will refer you to the White House counsel's office. They are the [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2634.48s)]
*  people who would be able to answer that question about classified information. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2639.12s)]
*  I have been very clear over and over again we are going to be prudent here. We're going to be [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2648.56s)]
*  consistent. This particular matter is being is being looked at. There's a legal process currently [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2653.2799999999997s)]
*  happening at the Department of Justice and I'm going to refer you to the Department of Justice [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2659.68s)]
*  on any specifics to this particular case and anything that has to deal with our what we're [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2664.48s)]
*  doing here. I would refer you to the White House counsel's office and let me remind you this is [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2671.28s)]
*  this is this is not a new process here. We've been doing this for the past two years. Anything that [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2676.56s)]
*  is related to a legal process a legal matter we refer to the Department of Justice. There's nothing [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2681.92s)]
*  new in our process here. Thank you. Since so many of our questions have been referred to the DOJ [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2688.88s)]
*  and to the White House counsel's office I'm sure you can understand that we're in sort of information [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2696.56s)]
*  blackout where DOJ refers us to the special counsel. They're not holding any briefings. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2700.6400000000003s)]
*  White House counsel refers us to DOJ. So if you are not able to talk about this from the podium [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2707.28s)]
*  would you invite a DOJ official to take our questions here to the briefing? No you would [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2713.04s)]
*  have to go to the Department of Justice. That is not it. This is a legal matter that is currently [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2718.24s)]
*  happening at the Department of Justice and the President has been very very clear when it comes [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2722.72s)]
*  to these types of legal matters when it comes to investigations he is not going to interfere. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2727.04s)]
*  He wants to make sure that we give back the independence that the Department of Justice [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2732.3199999999997s)]
*  should have when it comes to these types of investigations so certainly would not be bringing [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2736.3999999999996s)]
*  them here. So I would refer you to the Department of Justice. I just I was just very clear if you [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2741.12s)]
*  have any questions I would refer you to the White House counsel's office. They did a call for 45 [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2747.76s)]
*  minutes yesterday speaking to many of you. I believe there were more than 200 people on that call [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2752.7200000000003s)]
*  and so I would refer you to my colleagues at the White House counsel's office. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2758.0s)]
*  But on questions that you should be able to answer here that shouldn't have to go [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2765.6000000000004s)]
*  to any other agency or entity can you tell us if there's any sort of assessment that has been [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2768.88s)]
*  planned or launched to determine if national security has been jeopardized at all? Again [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2774.4s)]
*  that's for the Department of Justice. Why is it a DOJ question? And let's be clear it's not your [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2779.92s)]
*  decision to make on what I can or can't answer from here. What I'm telling you is that we are [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2783.92s)]
*  respecting the process. We are being prudent from here. There is an investigation currently happening [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2788.7200000000003s)]
*  and when there is when there are investigations that are happening that the DOJ is currently [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2794.96s)]
*  reviewing or looking at we have been very consistent to say that you need to go to the [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2800.72s)]
*  Department of Justice. Again I would refer you I would it's very it's it's very clear is I just [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2806.24s)]
*  laid out there is no there should be no confusion here. There is a legal process happening and I [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2814.24s)]
*  would refer you to the Department of Justice. Okay go ahead Peter. Can I just follow up on that? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2820.16s)]
*  We've all reached out to the Department of Justice. A law enforcement official tells NBC News the [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2824.7999999999997s)]
*  Justice Department has not told the White House that it cannot talk about the facts underlying [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2828.08s)]
*  the special counsel investigation into classified documents. So trusting you've received that same [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2832.3199999999997s)]
*  information understanding the desire to be prudent then why why can't you speak about the underlying [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2837.92s)]
*  facts? We've been very clear when it comes to even underlying facts when it comes to specifics when [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2843.52s)]
*  it comes to something that is under the purview that is that the Department of Justice is looking [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2848.48s)]
*  at especially legal matters investigations we do not comment from here Peter that has been [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2853.04s)]
*  consistent. So understanding that Bob Bauer who represents the president's personal attorney over [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2858.96s)]
*  the weekend said that one of the reasons why and Ian Sam's your colleague who represents who speaks [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2864.32s)]
*  on behalf of the special counsel at the White House spoke to this in some form yesterday but he said [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2868.96s)]
*  one of the reasons why they shouldn't reveal further details right now was regular ongoing [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2874.32s)]
*  public disclosures also pose the risk that as further information develops answers provided on [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2879.6s)]
*  this periodic basis may be incomplete. When the White House did release a statement the president [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2884.48s)]
*  spoke out on January 9th the risk of incompletion was a function of the White House's decision not [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2889.6s)]
*  to share all the information it knew in fact because we knew on November 2nd and the first [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2896.64s)]
*  discovery was made we knew the second discovery was made on December 20th so there's a risk of [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2902.64s)]
*  incompletion but will you concede that it's the White House that has been incomplete in its provision [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2908.4s)]
*  of information when it did choose to speak out publicly on January 9th. So my colleague actually [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2913.6800000000003s)]

*  someone is the White House in talks right now to find someone either outside the White House [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2936.88s)]
*  or internally who can speak on behalf of the White House representing the special counsel office [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2940.32s)]

*  counsel's office. But you're the communications you run communications on behalf of you as a communications [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2948.88s)]
*  matter having playing any part of those conversations existing. Peter you have spoken to my colleague [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2954.0s)]
*  who did again a 45 minute call with all of you answering questions about. If you would acknowledge [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2959.6800000000003s)]
*  it's on background that green not on the record until the call ends that means the American people [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2966.0s)]
*  can't see it in public. So we're asking will there be a representative who would speak on camera and [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2970.4s)]
*  see it in public. But his the call was indeed he was quoted it was in in papers it was on networks. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2974.16s)]
*  Correct but because they can't witness it happening live Americans don't get the same transparency [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2980.56s)]
*  into this back and forth. I think I think. Is the White House having a conversation. Peter. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2985.04s)]
*  This is just with respect you guys brought John Kirby in I'm asking if that conversation exists. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2989.6800000000003s)]
*  The fact that he spoke to all of you reporters who report on this and then you all reported on [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2993.2s)]
*  it back to the American people. I believe that is transparency. I believe that he shared information [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=2998.96s)]
*  he answered your questions that you believe that the American people wanted to hear and he answered [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3004.96s)]
*  those questions. And he took he took 45 minutes to do that. Anything anything else that you have on [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3010.24s)]
*  this Peter I would refer to the White House counsel. Peter I'm not we just went back. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3016.8799999999997s)]
*  Peter. Are you having a conversation about adding a member to the staff to speak publicly on the [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3022.64s)]
*  side. Peter I just I actually just answered that question I said we have someone currently. So that means no. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3027.3599999999997s)]
*  We have someone currently who answered your questions for 45 minutes on a call and took [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3035.6s)]
*  your questions. Yes. Took your questions about this particular issue. Correct. He will continue [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3040.72s)]
*  to do that. He will continue to engage with all of you right on this issue on this legal process [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3047.04s)]
*  that's currently happening from the White House counsel's office. After that Peter I don't have [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3054.16s)]
*  anything else to share. Go ahead. Go ahead. Last question. On the debt limit I know that the White [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3059.2s)]
*  House says that you're not going to negotiate with Republicans on sort of you know concessions or [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3066.7200000000003s)]
*  anything tied to it. Does that mean that the White House the president is is dissuading other [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3071.68s)]
*  Democrats on the Hill from engaging in those conversations and those negotiations with [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3076.72s)]
*  Republicans. What we've been very clear about is that in the last administration the debt ceiling [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3080.64s)]
*  was dealt with three times three times in a bipartisan way and so that's what the president [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3085.4399999999996s)]
*  wants to see. That is a that is a it is their constitutional duty for Congress to deal with [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3091.6s)]
*  this issue and again it's been done in a bipartisan way and we should not put the full [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3098.88s)]
*  faith and credit of of of our country and take it hostage right. We should not do that and so [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3106.8s)]
*  that's what we've been very clear about. It's been done in a bipartisan way the last three times under [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3115.2000000000003s)]
*  three times under the last administration and that's what we want to see. Just to be clear [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3120.4s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans in a bipartisan way reach an understanding reach an agreement as it [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3124.56s)]
*  relates to the debt limit the president would accept that. We've been we've been very clear there [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3128.4s)]
*  should not be any negotiations around here we should not be stepping around dealing with the [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3132.32s)]
*  debt ceiling. We've been incredibly clear here this is an issue that is a constant the basic [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3137.12s)]
*  the basic duties of Congress to take care of to handle and so we're going to be continue to say [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3143.52s)]
*  that we're going to be very clear it should be done without conditions. Thank you everybody. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=egHXJpBBWRw&t=3149.84s)]
