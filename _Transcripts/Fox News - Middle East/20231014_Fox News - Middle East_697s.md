# Iran's UN statement is a 'sick joke': Guy Benson
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw)
*  President Biden, what worries you about a potential Israeli ground invasion? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas is the enemy and we need to destroy Hamas's capability to use the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=12.08s)]
*  We begin tonight with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=27.44s)]
*  I'm Ayesha Hasni along with Pete Hegseth, Sarah Carter and Guy Benson. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=35.04s)]
*  The next stage is coming. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=36.04s)]
*  That is the word tonight from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the Israeli [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=37.72s)]
*  military nears a quote, significant ground operation in its effort to take out Hamas [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=42.32s)]
*  terrorists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=47.64s)]
*  And we now know tonight 29 Americans were killed in those terror attacks on Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=48.92s)]
*  And Israel is stopping at nothing to take out Hamas. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=55.52s)]
*  You ready for the next stage? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=61.36s)]
*  The next stage is coming. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=62.720000000000006s)]
*  Also tonight an IDF spokesperson is doubling down on their message to residents of Gaza [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=67.0s)]
*  City. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=71.88s)]
*  Leave and don't go back until we say so. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=72.88s)]
*  And warning that the Israeli military will attack soon. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=76.4s)]
*  And the USS Eisenhower carrier strike group is now joining the Ford carrier strike group [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=80.16s)]
*  in the eastern Mediterranean in a big show of force. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=86.2s)]
*  A big part of the effort is to rescue the more than 120 hostages being held right now [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=89.08s)]
*  by Hamas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=95.12s)]
*  And we don't know right now exactly how many of those are American. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=96.56s)]
*  The State Department though tonight says there are at least 15 U.S. citizens who are currently [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=100.96s)]
*  missing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=106.4s)]
*  Hostages in Gaza are the critical piece and we're on the clock. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=108.36s)]
*  So what you're seeing with the missile strikes, what you're seeing right now with the artillery, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=111.44s)]
*  is doing a couple of things. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=116.27999999999999s)]
*  It's opening pathways for our infantry units and over 300,000 reservists to be able to [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=117.27999999999999s)]
*  go in and reduce risk when the counteroffensive initiates. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=121.83999999999999s)]
*  But it's also designed to buy the Israeli Defense Forces high command enough time to [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=126.72s)]
*  be able to locate multiple structures, could be dozens of structures, multiple tunnels, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=133.35999999999999s)]
*  dozens of tunnels for our special operations forces to be able to launch a multiple layered [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=139.48s)]
*  hostage rescue operation. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=146.56s)]
*  And while the president says his administration is doing everything it can to bring the hostages [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=149.76s)]
*  home, the State Department says it is quote, working around the clock along with the Israeli [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=154.68s)]
*  government to rescue them. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=160.2s)]
*  And all of the families who haven't heard from their loved ones since they were kidnapped [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=162.28s)]
*  a week ago now from Hamas militants, they can only watch and wait. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=166.95999999999998s)]
*  I have to hold on to optimism and hope because right now it is the only option for me. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=173.76s)]
*  Our family is desperate and we want information and we want our family to return to us as [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  soon as possible. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=185.11999999999998s)]
*  I want to see our governments focus on that being the priority. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=186.11999999999998s)]
*  Okay, this is a very serious moment in history. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=191.0s)]
*  Israel is readying for a ground invasion any moment now. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=195.8s)]
*  Axios just reporting today that Iran has sent a message to Israel via the UN saying, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=199.96s)]
*  we don't want to get involved, but we will if there is further escalation against Hamas. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=205.88000000000002s)]
*  Now we obviously are seeing some of our carrier strike groups moving closer to the Mediterranean. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=211.84s)]
*  Pete, I want to go to you first and ask, what do you anticipate happens in the next couple [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=216.96s)]
*  of moments here in the next couple of days? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=221.16000000000003s)]
*  What should the US be doing? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=224.12s)]
*  Well, it's no surprise that Iran is communicating through their buddies at the UN at this point. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=225.44s)]
*  The folks in Gaza are counting on international condemnation coming quick. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=232.8s)]
*  Hamas has shown a willingness from the get go, not just from the massacre, but how they [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=237.12s)]
*  conduct themselves to try to want maximum civilian casualties, to rally so-called international [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=242.0s)]
*  support to their cause. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=249.48000000000002s)]
*  That's why Bibi Netanyahu has to thread such a needle here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=251.08s)]
*  You've got to get the retribution that your people deserve, that the language of strength [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  requires in the Middle East in the Gaza Strip by destroying Hamas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=257.52s)]
*  And then you've got 29 Americans and you've got 120 plus hostages there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=261.48s)]
*  And Aaron Cohen might be right. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=264.68s)]
*  This might be a giant buildup for a massive hostage rescue situation. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=266.24s)]
*  But you need to do all that without trying to entice Hezbollah in the north to open another [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=272.14s)]
*  front, which does complicate things for the Israeli military if they do that. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=277.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=281.32s)]
*  I want to jump in here really quickly because I was talking to an analyst earlier this evening, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=282.36s)]
*  an expert in the region, was just in Jerusalem a few days ago. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=285.48s)]
*  And he was telling me, look, Iran is playing a big chess game here, right? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=289.64s)]
*  This is a multi-layer. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=293.86s)]
*  There could be a second act coming. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=294.86s)]
*  And we've got to start paying attention to Hezbollah in the north and also this lion's [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=296.88s)]
*  den group, an Iranian proxy group in the West Bank. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=301.15999999999997s)]
*  If Israel gets knee deep in Gaza, it could expose the other fronts. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=304.56s)]
*  And if you see proxies head in, I mean, you're talking about the U.S. could possibly get [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=309.64s)]
*  involved here. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=314.8s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=315.8s)]
*  I think this certainly is. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=316.8s)]
*  And I agree with Pete, an Iranian operation, planned operation with Hamas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=317.88s)]
*  We know that the Iranian government is the biggest state sponsor of terror in the world. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=323.15999999999997s)]
*  We've seen their actions across the globe from attacks in Argentina many years ago, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=328.84s)]
*  Jewish settlements, into what they use, groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=335.23999999999995s)]
*  And one of the big issues, I think, here is how Iran is going to use this as a PR front. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=340.88s)]
*  So Iran's playing everything on the back end, right? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  And Hamas is expecting this ground assault to rally the troops, so to speak, in the public. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=349.26s)]
*  And what is going to happen now is you're going to see Israel move in. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=358.14s)]
*  You're going to see Gaza, the shaking, what they say, the second phase, the shaking of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=362.88000000000005s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=367.32000000000005s)]
*  And even if Netanyahu has to be very strategic, Netanyahu has to send a direct message to [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=368.32000000000005s)]
*  Iran that we will not allow you to move into that second phase. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=373.84000000000003s)]
*  What you were talking about with your expert is something that I think Pete and I have [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=378.0s)]
*  seen in the war zones. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=382.52000000000004s)]
*  This is something that we've seen in Afghanistan, where Iran has been very involved with the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=384.08000000000004s)]
*  Taliban and using the Taliban as a proxy. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=388.96000000000004s)]
*  We've seen it in Iraq, the same issue. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=391.92s)]
*  And what we've seen is Iran utilizing the media, utilizing what we've seen in New York [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=394.68s)]
*  recently with all the students in the streets. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=398.96000000000004s)]
*  This is all part of their strategy. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=402.58000000000004s)]
*  And I've got to tell you, Aisha, I'm very, very concerned because we are moving closer [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=404.68s)]
*  and closer to expanding this far beyond the Middle East with the U.S. involved, the USS [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=410.08000000000004s)]
*  Eisenhower there. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=418.16s)]
*  Obviously, our troops are waiting for actionable intelligence to possibly go in and rescue [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=419.24s)]
*  these hostages. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=424.04s)]
*  But a lot of people that I have been speaking to don't believe there's a good chance we're [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=425.26000000000005s)]
*  going to get the hostages out, especially with this ground assault right now. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=429.66s)]
*  And can I just point out the sick joke of Iran putting out this statement through the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=433.28000000000003s)]
*  UN that if we get involved further, then they're suddenly going to get involved, but they don't [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=438.36s)]
*  want to? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=443.92s)]
*  Their fingerprints are already all over this. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=445.20000000000005s)]
*  It's a completely non-credible thing for them to say. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=449.14000000000004s)]
*  They're basically trolling the world with that backchannel statement that they made public. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=453.06s)]
*  Well, you know, Pete, you said Bibi Netanyahu is threading a needle here. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=458.1s)]
*  I think President Biden is threading a needle as well. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=461.70000000000005s)]
*  The administration has been trying to walk this very tight line. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=464.62s)]
*  Jackie Heinrich, our White House correspondent, has been reporting that the administration [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=467.98s)]
*  has asked Israel privately to delay operations in Gaza while safe passage is given to civilian [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  civilians in Gaza City. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=479.1s)]
*  But then they're officially saying U.S. officials have not asked Israel to slow down. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=481.78000000000003s)]
*  They've sort of just been having discussions around that. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=487.22s)]
*  They keep doing this, Guy, back and forth with the $6 billion as well. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=490.58s)]
*  We have the right to freeze them, but we're not freezing them, and then privately saying, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=494.58s)]
*  telling at least House Democrats, that it's in limbo. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=501.3s)]
*  I mean, what is going on here with this administration? [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=504.18s)]
*  Well, sometimes you'll have politicians say things publicly for the cameras and for public [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  consumption and then something behind closed doors. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=511.38s)]
*  That's not exactly a shock. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=513.94s)]
*  I had an interview this week with Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state on my [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=515.74s)]
*  radio show. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=519.46s)]
*  First interview since this all broke out a week ago. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=520.46s)]
*  And her biggest piece of advice to the Biden administration, to the United States government [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=523.34s)]
*  right now, is not to try to tell Israel what to do or what not to do, because they have [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=527.14s)]
*  been attacked in this completely savage way, and it's completely unacceptable. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=533.62s)]
*  And Israel has to do what that country has to do with our help to some extent to protect [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=539.5s)]
*  themselves. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=544.7s)]
*  And I am, for one, absolutely sick of seeing already preemptively people lecturing the [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=545.7s)]
*  Israelis about how they ought to delay this or they shouldn't do that or could this be [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=550.98s)]
*  a war crime. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=555.7s)]
*  A lot of those people don't want Israel to have any option. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=557.34s)]
*  And they take all the agency away from Hamas. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=561.26s)]
*  If you want to make demands of who can bring about peace right now, who can help the people [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=563.5s)]
*  in Gaza to not potentially get killed in this invasion, the people who can actually achieve [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=567.98s)]
*  that if they wanted to are Hamas. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=573.34s)]
*  They don't want to. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=575.58s)]
*  And yet they're almost like out of the equation in a lot of the public conversation. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=577.12s)]
*  It's insane. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=581.46s)]
*  But Guy, Hamas is certainly using the weakness in the United States and our feckled policy [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=582.46s)]
*  Iran from the very beginning of the Biden administration to make this move. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=588.62s)]
*  I think Iran knew from the get-go how weak President Biden was. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=591.62s)]
*  They planned this for more than two years. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=596.1s)]
*  This was a strategy on their part to use Hamas as a proxy. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=598.44s)]
*  And you're absolutely right, Ayesha. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=602.36s)]
*  I was just thinking to myself right now, we don't know what the second phase for Iran [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=603.86s)]
*  will be. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=608.26s)]
*  I mean, Netanyahu has issued his second phase saying we're going to go in on a ground assault. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=609.26s)]
*  But the Iranians think ahead and the Iranians are expecting this ground assault. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=613.68s)]
*  My question is, and maybe Pete, you know this, but what can Iran do to escalate this further? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=619.04s)]
*  And how will Iran escalate this further to draw us in and the rest of the world? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  And that's probably not just utilizing the UN but forcing our… [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=630.3599999999999s)]
*  Well, they've got a lot of options to do that if they want to. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=633.9599999999999s)]
*  The problem, Guy, you're exactly right. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=635.9399999999999s)]
*  The instinct of this White House from the beginning has been both-sides-ism, has been [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=637.6999999999999s)]
*  ceasefire after you've got 1,300 dead Israelis. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=642.0s)]
*  That was the first tweet you saw out of the Palestinian Affairs Office. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=646.52s)]
*  They've deleted several tweets. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=648.92s)]
*  And they deleted them and that's good. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=651.12s)]
*  But that's a revelation of the instinct. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=652.6s)]
*  A White House full of pro-Palestinian millennials ready to chomp it at the bit with the older [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=654.48s)]
*  guard there saying, okay, we will back Israel. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=659.46s)]
*  I think Hamas, Iran understand that instinct. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=662.2s)]
*  They feel like the leash will be short on Bibi Netanyahu and that's where Israel has [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=665.96s)]
*  to do what it has to do. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=670.18s)]
*  And they've done what they need to do. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=671.8s)]
*  They've warned civilians to get out and it's Hamas who wants them to stay because they [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=673.4s)]
*  want those human children. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=676.92s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2-S-5TM0pw&t=677.92s)]
