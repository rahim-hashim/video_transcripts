# I want to wake up from the nightmare: Father whose son is missing after Hamas attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc)
*  We have to put this tragedy in perspective and the lives that were lost, including oftentimes [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=0.0s)]
*  young people who were just getting together for an event, a festival to celebrate music [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=6.08s)]
*  and fun and having a good life. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=11.28s)]
*  Jonathan Dekelten joins us right now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  Jonathan is the father of Segwit Dekelten. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=15.96s)]
*  His son is missing after this Hamas attack. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=18.84s)]
*  He's very kind to join us right now. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=21.72s)]
*  Jonathan, good to have you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=23.64s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=25.76s)]
*  What have you heard on where your son might be? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=28.68s)]
*  What have you heard, period? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=33.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, with your permission, I think this needs a bit of background. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=35.76s)]
*  My son and I and the rest of our family live on a kibbutz, a cooperative farm, one of many [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=41.08s)]
*  along the border that were attacked by Hamas terrorists on Saturday morning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=49.32s)]
*  I and dozens of other families on my kibbutz alone lost contact with our loved ones, those [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=56.96s)]
*  that were not murdered on the spot, lost contact with people taken into, that are hostages [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=63.36s)]
*  now in Gaza, at around 9.30 in the morning on Saturday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=69.92s)]
*  And from that point forward, we have heard nothing from Hamas about their condition, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=75.8s)]
*  if they're alive. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=82.68s)]
*  We are entirely in the dark. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=84.68s)]
*  So you've heard what the ambassador had to say. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=87.4s)]
*  You know about this ground war that could be launched any day. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=91.04s)]
*  We don't obviously know the details. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=94.28s)]
*  No one's going to share that. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=95.76s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=97.4s)]
*  Because if he is still in the Gaza region, this could be a tense time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=98.76s)]
*  Well, it's certainly a dilemma. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=106.72s)]
*  But as in life, two things can be true at the same time. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=109.80000000000001s)]
*  I want to wake up from the bad dream, the nightmare, that my son and at least 150 others [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=114.64s)]
*  are being held captive by savages and would want to do anything to get him and others [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  freed. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=128.44s)]
*  That is certainly true, and hence I'm here. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=129.44s)]
*  And I'm also just as certain about the other truth, which is if there was any doubt about [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  who our neighbors are, who the governing authority is, Hamas, whatever protesters might say tomorrow [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=137.84s)]
*  in this or that place, this is the heart of evil, Hamas. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=143.6s)]
*  This attack on my home, on my kibbutz and dozens like us, was planned well in advance. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=151.28s)]
*  Over 100 heavily armed terrorists invaded my kibbutz with one thing in mind, killing [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  as many people as they could find, abducting the rest and then destroying the entire community. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=167.2s)]
*  What is left is just a burnt shell. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=175.67999999999998s)]
*  I'm a peacenik. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=179.0s)]
*  It may surprise you, but almost everyone who lives along the border with Gaza is much like [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=181.16s)]
*  me, committed to peace with our Palestinian neighbors. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  And most of us provide a kind of disproportionate number of combat soldiers to the Israeli army [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=191.04s)]
*  during our time of military service, but believing entirely that the only future, the only future [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=198.48s)]
*  for my, I once hoped for my children, now it's my grandchildren, the only hope for peace [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  is, or the only hope for a better future, is a peace between us and our Palestinian [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  neighbors. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=217.51999999999998s)]
*  But without Hamas, without an offshoot of ISIS on our door, and again, if anyone had [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=218.76s)]
*  any doubt what this was all about, Saturday proved it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=226.72s)]
*  These hundred terrorists who came to kill dozens of people, dozens of people in my home [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=230.78s)]
*  and kidnapped many dozens more, they did not come to conquer territory, they did not come [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=236.44s)]
*  to create a Palestinian state, they came to murder. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=244.6s)]
*  And there are many names we could give to this, but this simply can't be ignored. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=249.48s)]
*  All good thinking people, whatever our political orientations might be or religious orientations [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=255.08s)]
*  might be. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=260.24s)]
*  It's never been clear, you know, sometimes the Middle East can be a little blurry and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=261.76s)]
*  difficult to understand. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=267.0s)]
*  There's no more wiggle room. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=269.68s)]
*  It's very difficult to say right now what the day after is going to look like. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=272.44s)]
*  First of all, I pray that my son will come home with the rest of the hostages. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=276.56s)]
*  But even then, if this problem is not solved, for Israelis and Palestinians of having an [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=280.24s)]
*  offshoot of ISIS ruling a country, well, a place that would like to be a country, then [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=286.7s)]
*  that's a problem for the world. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=292.2s)]
*  And there will come a time, there will come a time when we and they will have the leadership [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=295.16s)]
*  that's brave enough to work towards peace. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=305.36s)]
*  It's not that way quite yet. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=308.12s)]
*  But first we have to get through this truly horrific crisis. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=311.56s)]
*  You know, you sound like a remarkable dad and granddad, and I'm just wondering how your [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=316.52000000000004s)]
*  family is holding up, how you are holding up. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=321.28s)]
*  Well, I'm holding up because, you know, as an old soldier, I only really know how to [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=325.52s)]
*  go forward. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  And I'm filling my time and doing what I can to raise awareness about what has happened, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=334.32s)]
*  and including the hostage situation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=340.28s)]
*  And these were civilians. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=343.52s)]
*  These are not army personnel. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=344.71999999999997s)]
*  There's no military targets. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=346.11999999999995s)]
*  Inarchiblets are anywhere around. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=348.23999999999995s)]
*  These are teachers. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=350.3s)]
*  These are nurses. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=351.42s)]
*  These are parents ripped from their homes. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=353.54s)]
*  As far as the rest of my family members, Sagia, the father of two beautiful young girls with [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=357.74s)]
*  his wife expecting their third girl, she feared for her life, huddling with her little children [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=362.28000000000003s)]
*  along with all the other survivors of this attack on the Kibbutz, not knowing whether [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=369.54s)]
*  she was going to survive during the nine hours of assault. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=374.62s)]
*  And hearing her husband outside the door in the apartment in hand-to-hand combat, along [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=379.3s)]
*  with other young and not so young men on the Kibbutz, trying to repulse these, again, heavily [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=386.18s)]
*  armed, well-trained terrorists. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=392.94s)]
*  So the survivors of the Kibbutz, the survivors from this attack on the Kibbutz, they are [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=395.65999999999997s)]
*  all in a state of trauma, and it's very difficult to imagine when they'll be able to recover [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=403.06s)]
*  from it. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=408.7s)]
*  Well, our prayers are with you and particularly, Sagia, it seems like there's a lot of very [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=409.7s)]
*  special DNA running there. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=414.7s)]
*  Be strong, Jonathan. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=416.5s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=417.5s)]
*  I know that was not easy. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=418.5s)]
*  I appreciate your interest. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=421.5s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=423.06s)]
*  You've got the world's interest. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=424.06s)]
*  Jonathan Dekalchen, his son, Sagia Dekalchen, again, held hostage, one of 150, we are told, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=425.06s)]
*  that Hamas has captive right now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=430.98s)]
*  We'll keep you posted on that. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=433.21999999999997s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHdEhTezMbc&t=434.5s)]
