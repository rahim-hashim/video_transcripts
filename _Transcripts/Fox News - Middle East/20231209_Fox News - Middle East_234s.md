# US troops in Middle East 'provide a point of vulnerability,' warns expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. We're learning American troops in the Middle [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=0.0s)]
*  East with a target of 10 separate attacks in just 24 hours, which totals 85 [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=4.28s)]
*  such instances in less than two months. U.S. officials are calling out the [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=10.98s)]
*  aggression, saying these latest assaults by Iranian-backed militia groups show a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=15.56s)]
*  definite escalation. Senior fellow at Defense Priorities and Retired Army [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=19.88s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis joins us now. Colonel, we've seen these attacks [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=24.72s)]
*  over since October 7th. There's a huge spike in just the last 24-36 hours. What [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=29.4s)]
*  do you make of this? Yeah, I mean it's the continuation of what I've been [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=36.4s)]
*  screaming about here on Fox literally for years, that all those troops do in [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=40.6s)]
*  in the Iraq and Syria is provide a point of vulnerability for our country. They do [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=45.72s)]
*  not do anything positive for us. They should be withdrawn. And I can tell you [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=51.4s)]
*  back in 2018 during the Trump administration, he tried to get them out [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=55.92s)]
*  and he said he was going to withdraw them to take away that risk. And [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=60.36s)]
*  unfortunately he was thwarted by many in the defense department and many [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  even in his own administration senior leaders convinced him that it was a good [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=69.0s)]
*  idea. It wasn't. And this is the reason why. Because if any of those Americans [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=72.72s)]
*  are eventually killed, there is going to be a strong compulsion on the [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=77.48s)]
*  administration to strike not just those groups but even into Iran with people [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=81.6s)]
*  keep saying it all the time. I hear that. That could draw us into a war would be [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=85.72s)]
*  tremendously worse for our situation than the situation right now. What we [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=90.2s)]
*  should do is get those troops withdrawn to other locations where they're more [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=94.28s)]
*  defensible and where we can be better used to our defense. Colonel, what do you [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=97.42s)]
*  say to those who say, well, they're there to degrade ISIS or they're there to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=101.92s)]
*  prevent Iranian weapons and fighters from moving more easily from Iran into [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=107.24s)]
*  say Beirut or Lebanon where they can more easily attack Israel? Yeah, those [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=112.2s)]
*  that's nonsense. I hear it all the time and it's graphically untrue. If you look [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=117.4s)]
*  on the map, you see that the whole country of Syria, there's a couple of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=121.84s)]
*  dots on the map where we have a handful of troops, 1000 troops and the idea [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=125.76s)]
*  that that is gonna damage ISIS and somehow protect us here is just utter [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=130.4s)]
*  nonsense. I've been on the ground in that area. I've seen it. I have four [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=134.88s)]
*  combat deployments, three of which were in this area on those kinds of [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=139.56s)]
*  missions. I saw when we had 140,000 people in Iraq in Afghanistan. And of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=143.08s)]
*  course, what we know now is that the Taliban, the people we were going after, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=149.06s)]
*  they kept increasing in number. They didn't go down so that I did it 1000 or [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=152.98s)]
*  less than 1000 is gonna keep us safe. It's just nonsense. They don't perform [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=157.76s)]
*  those functions. That's what people want to believe. It's just not true. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=161.66s)]
*  Colonel, you mentioned them as a point of vulnerability. How vulnerable are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=165.26s)]
*  them? I mean, are they are they able to strike back? Are they able to leave [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=169.2s)]
*  the wire or are they just receiving incoming and hoping the administration [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=173.16s)]
*  does something about it? Well, for the most part, that's exactly what they're [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=176.44s)]
*  doing. They're basically providing security for their selves in there. And [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  of course, they do have additional air defense capacities to try and shoot [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  down these drones. And so far, those things have been successful, but it's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=186.92s)]
*  just rolling the dots to wonder when one of these strikes finally gets home. Now, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=190.5s)]
*  one of these drone strikes actually hit a barracks building and God was [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=194.68s)]
*  protecting them and it didn't explode. But if that had not been lucky, we would [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  already have had people killed and we just don't know when the next one of [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=204.12s)]
*  those is gonna come up there. But why should we put american troops on the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  ground in harm's way when it's not even useful for our country and it could [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=210.46s)]
*  spur us into a larger war? It doesn't make any sense to me. Yeah, and get [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  americans killed in the process. Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis. Thank [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=218.02s)]
*  you for your time. Thanks for having me. You got it. I'm Steve juicy. I'm [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aj3-qDU_UII&t=221.06s)]
