# 'MAJOR ESCALATION': Long-range rockets reportedly fired towards Jerusalem
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY)
*  And we have Trey Yngst on the ground with some breaking developments. Trey, what do you see? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, just a few moments ago, you might have seen there on our live camera a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=6.96s)]
*  huge barrage of rockets from the northern part of the Gaza Strip. You could see the angle at which they were fired [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=10.72s)]
*  indicated they were long-range rockets. And I'm told by my producer here, they are targeting [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=16.86s)]
*  Jerusalem, air raid sirens sounding in the largest Israeli city. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=22.64s)]
*  Obviously a major, major escalation as this fighting continues. The Israeli strikes continue along the border as well and [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=27.2s)]
*  artillery units working at this hour. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=34.76s)]
*  I also just got off the phone with someone from the Israeli military who indicated there are staging areas all along the Gaza border. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=36.64s)]
*  This may not only be a push from the north, but also from the east that would immediately go into [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=44.2s)]
*  Sajaya and some of these other neighborhoods in Gaza that are heavily populated [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=51.52s)]
*  but also are used by groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad to hide weaponry. All of this unfolding and erupting on [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=55.88s)]
*  Saturday morning when more than a thousand Palestinian militants entered southern Israel taking hostages and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=63.720000000000006s)]
*  slaughtering civilians. They went to a music festival and mowed down [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=71.28s)]
*  260 people. Many were wounded, taken from that area and brought back into the Gaza Strip. They went to communities along Gaza and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=75.88s)]
*  killed women and children. This was a barbaric act that unfolded and now today Israel is preparing their response. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=85.36s)]
*  Behind me you can see Israeli tanks that are staging along with soldiers. More than [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=92.52s)]
*  300,000 reserve forces have been called up to fight in this war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  There are strikes at this moment. I'm seeing just now coming across in Lebanon on the northern border. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=103.04s)]
*  So you not only have these troops staging here on Israel's southern border, but you also have strikes taking place on Israel's northern border [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=109.12s)]
*  after an [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=117.4s)]
*  infiltration attempt earlier today and also rocket fire from a Palestinian group in southern Lebanon. Very quickly [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=118.76s)]
*  this is developing into a multi-front conflict. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=125.32000000000001s)]
*  It's part of the reason the military posture is so high across the country. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=128.24s)]
*  This is a state prepared for war and the coming days will be very difficult, violent and bloody. Back to you. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=132.28s)]
*  Trey Yanks, thank you for that breaking news report. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4kdvpPQMuY&t=139.08s)]
