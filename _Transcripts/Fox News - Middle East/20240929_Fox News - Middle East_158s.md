# 'LEAKS': Brig. Gen. Rob Spalding says this event caused Israel to lose trust in America
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg)
*  Well, our next guest knows all about facing a radical Islamist, and that's retired U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=0.0s)]
*  Army Brigadier General Rob Spaulding. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=4.4s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=6.0s)]
*  General, thank you for being here. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=7.24s)]
*  Not only was Nasrallah killed, but then his replacement was killed quickly as well. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=10.72s)]
*  We're also hearing reports, and I want to put this headline up from the times of Israel, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=14.64s)]
*  that Bibi Netanyahu didn't want to tell the U.S. ahead of the Nasrallah strike for fear [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=19.44s)]
*  that our administration, our leadership would try to prevent it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=25.52s)]
*  Help us, General, understand the mindset that says you wouldn't want the death of a terrorist [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=29.82s)]
*  leader. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=34.62s)]
*  Well, you can go back to our participation in the Coastal War. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=35.62s)]
*  We were concerned about leaks coming from our coalition allies, and so we had to shield [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=39.22s)]
*  them from some of the information that was coming out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=44.74s)]
*  I think it's very similar. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=46.58s)]
*  Here the Israelis just don't trust America because there's such an anti-Jewish backlash [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=48.379999999999995s)]
*  going on, and there's people within the administration that also feel this way. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=55.260000000000005s)]
*  So I'm sure they're concerned that whatever they do might be leaked to Hezbollah, which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=59.66s)]
*  is unfortunate. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=65.89999999999999s)]
*  It's incredible. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  So the fear is if we share it with the United States, somehow it gets to Hezbollah, or the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=68.46s)]
*  pressure is too much and a strike like that is prevented. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=74.34s)]
*  That's no way to fight and win a war. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=77.62s)]
*  How does Israel navigate? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=79.17999999999999s)]
*  This is their fight against Hamas, against Hezbollah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=80.53999999999999s)]
*  How do they navigate the next three, four months while Biden is still in office? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=83.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, it's not just their fight. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=88.34s)]
*  Do you think about it? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=90.06s)]
*  Nasrallah and Hezbollah are responsible for killing hundreds of Americans. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=91.06s)]
*  So it's our fight, too. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=95.18s)]
*  What's unfortunate here is that we aren't in sync with Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=96.58s)]
*  You know, if you go back to the Trump administration, the Abraham Accords, we were strangling Iran [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=100.54s)]
*  economically. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=106.62s)]
*  You know, today we've taken all those off. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=107.62s)]
*  And so in essence, we've made the Israelis' job harder. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=110.42s)]
*  And so by working together with Israelis, I think we could get a lot done. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=114.22s)]
*  Unfortunately, we're just not there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=117.78s)]
*  So they're going to have to do it on their own until something changes. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=119.18s)]
*  I think that's exactly right. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=123.06s)]
*  For the next couple of months, it's do it on our own because we don't know where our [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=124.5s)]
*  partners are. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=127.42s)]
*  And then hopefully something does change because it was quite predictable under the Trump administration. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=128.82s)]
*  You're right. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=132.9s)]
*  A lot of this was unleashed because those Abraham Accords have been so successful that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=133.9s)]
*  potentially there was even an alliance between Israel and Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=137.14s)]
*  General, thank you very much for your time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=142.9s)]
*  Breaking it down. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=144.42000000000002s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63EP52QAhzg&t=145.42000000000002s)]
