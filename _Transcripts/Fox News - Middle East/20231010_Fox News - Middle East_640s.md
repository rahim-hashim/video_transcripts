**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk)

*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=6.88s)]
*  You know, there are moments in this life, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=9.58s)]
*  I mean this literally, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=12.88s)]

*  a group who stated purpose for being is to kill Jews. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=31.82s)]
*  This was an act of sheer evil. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=38.019999999999996s)]
*  More than 1,000 civilians slaughtered, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=41.36s)]
*  not just killed, slaughtered in Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=44.5s)]

*  To celebrate peace. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=69.56s)]
*  Women raped, assaulted, paraded as trophies. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=72.02s)]
*  Families hid their fear for hours and hours desperately [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=75.86s)]
*  trying to keep their children quiet [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=80.14s)]
*  to avoid drawing attention. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=83.02s)]
*  And thousands of wounded, alive but carrying with them [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=86.12s)]
*  the bullet holes and the shrapnel wounds [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=90.16s)]
*  and the memory of what they endured. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=92.04s)]
*  You all know these traumas never go away. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=95.98s)]
*  There's still so many families desperately waiting [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=99.28s)]
*  to hear the fate of their loved ones, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=101.44s)]
*  not knowing if they're alive or dead or hostages. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=103.98s)]

*  Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=111.24s)]
*  Hostages whom Hamas has now threatened to execute [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=115.78s)]
*  in violation of every code of human morality. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=119.42s)]
*  It's abhorrent. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=123.52s)]
*  The brutality of Hamas, these bloodthirstiness [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=125.82s)]
*  brings to mind the worst, the worst rampages of ISIS. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=130.56s)]
*  This is terrorism. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=136.06s)]
*  But sadly, for the Jewish people, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=138.4s)]
*  it's not new. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=141.06s)]
*  This attack has brought to the surface painful memories [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=143.26s)]
*  and the scars left by a millennia of anti-Semitism [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=147.0s)]
*  and genocide of the Jewish people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=150.39999999999998s)]
*  So in this moment, we must be crystal clear. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=155.73999999999998s)]
*  We stand with Israel. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=160.04s)]
*  We stand with Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=163.48s)]
*  And we will make sure Israel has what it needs [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=165.07999999999998s)]

*  and respond to this attack. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  There's no justification for terrorism. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=174.72s)]
*  There's no excuse. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=177.62s)]
*  Hamas does not stand for the Palestinian people's right [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=180.72s)]
*  to dignity and self-determination. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=183.5s)]
*  Its state of purpose is the annihilation [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=186.86s)]
*  of the State of Israel and the murder of Jewish people. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=188.5s)]
*  They use Palestinian civilians as human shields. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=192.9s)]
*  Hamas offers nothing but terror and bloodshed [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=197.0s)]
*  with no regard to who pays the price. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  The loss of innocent life is heartbreaking. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=207.44s)]
*  Like every nation in the world, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=211.48s)]
*  Israel has the right to respond, indeed has a duty to respond, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=213.73999999999998s)]
*  to these vicious attacks. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=217.62s)]
*  I just got off the phone with a third call [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=220.76s)]
*  with Prime Minister Netanyahu, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=223.56s)]

*  and the United States are stronger and more secure [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=237.42000000000002s)]

*  that have been ripped apart. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=263.74s)]

*  Our hearts may be broken, but our resolve is clear. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=423.64s)]
*  Yesterday, I also spoke with the leaders of France, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=427.68s)]
*  Germany, Italy, and UK to discuss the latest developments [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=430.34000000000003s)]
*  with our European allies [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=434.24s)]
*  and coordinate our united response. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=435.52s)]
*  This comes on top of days of steady engagement [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=439.86s)]
*  with partners across the region. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=443.0s)]
*  We're also taking steps at home. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=446.56s)]
*  In cities across the United States of America, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=449.06s)]
*  police departments have stepped up. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=451.66s)]
*  Security around centers for Jewish life. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=453.1s)]
*  The Department of Homeland Security [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=456.16s)]
*  and the Federal Bureau of Investigation [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=457.44s)]
*  are working closely with state and local law enforcement [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=459.4s)]
*  and Jewish community partners to identify [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=462.24s)]
*  and disrupt any domestic threat that could emerge [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=464.4s)]
*  in connection with these horrific attacks. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=467.44s)]
*  This is a moment for the United States to come together, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=471.78s)]
*  to grieve with those who are mourning. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=475.56s)]
*  Let's be real clear. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=479.76s)]
*  There is no place for hate in America. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=482.06s)]
*  Not against Jews, not against Muslims, not against anybody. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=485.66s)]
*  We reject, we reject what we reject is terrorism. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=490.54s)]
*  We condemn the indiscriminate evil, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=496.7s)]
*  just as we've always done. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=499.24s)]
*  That's what America stands for. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=501.08s)]
*  You know, just over 50 years ago, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=504.29999999999995s)]
*  I was thinking about it this morning, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=505.73999999999995s)]
*  talking to the Secretary of State, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=506.84s)]
*  the Vice President of my office. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=508.67999999999995s)]
*  Over 50 years ago, as a young senator, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=511.44s)]
*  I visited Israel for the first time [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=515.76s)]
*  as a newly elected senator. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=518.52s)]
*  And I had a long, long trip of meeting [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=522.06s)]
*  with Golda Meir in her office, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=526.16s)]
*  just before the Yom Kippur War. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=529.4s)]
*  I guess you could see the consternation of my face [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=534.4s)]
*  as she described what was being faced. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=538.0799999999999s)]
*  They were facing it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=541.0799999999999s)]
*  We walked outside in that sort of hallway outside her office [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=543.64s)]
*  to have some photos. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=549.78s)]
*  She looked at me all of a sudden and said, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=550.98s)]
*  would you like to have a photograph? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=552.78s)]
*  And so I got up and followed her out. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=556.16s)]
*  We were standing there silent, looking at the press. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=558.76s)]
*  She could tell I guess I was concerned. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=560.98s)]
*  She leaned over and whispered to me, she said, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=564.6800000000001s)]
*  don't worry, Senator Biden. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=567.0600000000001s)]
*  We have a secret weapon here in Israel. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=569.62s)]
*  My word is what she said. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=573.46s)]
*  We have no place else to go. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=575.96s)]
*  We have no place else to go. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=579.64s)]
*  For 75 years, Israel has stood as the only guarantor [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=583.74s)]
*  of the security of Jewish people around the world [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  so that the atrocities of the past could never happen again. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=592.14s)]
*  And let there be no doubt, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=595.84s)]
*  the United States has Israel's back. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=598.24s)]
*  We will make sure the Jewish and democratic state of Israel [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=601.38s)]
*  can defend itself today, tomorrow, as we always have. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=604.02s)]
*  It's as simple as that. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=608.72s)]
*  These atrocities have been sickening. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=611.22s)]
*  We're with Israel. Let's make no mistake. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=616.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=618.96s)]
*  What was your reaction? [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvN7h87X4Tk&t=620.56s)]
