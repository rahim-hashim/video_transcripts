# US is in 'one of most challenging times' from a national security perspective: Expert says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM)
*  We've got Rob Spaulding with us, a U.S. Air Force Brigadier General, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=0.0s)]
*  author of The Best Seller War Without Rules. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=3.04s)]
*  General, very good to have you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  Let me first get your take on this movement we're watching in Iran. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=6.78s)]
*  They're shifting some positions around and moving some things around. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=12.14s)]
*  They seem to be preparing for something, also coordinated with some proxies of theirs. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of all of that? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=20.12s)]
*  Well, I sure don't expect them to do anything directly against Israel [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=23.22s)]
*  because I don't think their forces are up to it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=26.900000000000002s)]
*  I do expect them to use proxies. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=28.74s)]
*  Hamas is pretty much defeated in Gaza, so perhaps Hezbollah, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=31.04s)]
*  perhaps some proxy forces that are operating out of Syria [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=35.78s)]
*  is what I would expect from the Iranians at this point. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=39.62s)]
*  So the next question then becomes what to do about Israel's response to that, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  whether through proxies or Iran itself. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=47.459999999999994s)]
*  And apparently, General, we have been telling Israel [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=50.82s)]
*  to carefully weigh any response to such an attack, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=53.7s)]
*  adding its potential that it could further spark escalation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=57.4s)]
*  I imagine the Israeli response to that will be, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=63.0s)]
*  we'll take it from here, but what did you make of that? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=66.0s)]
*  Well, and there would be the same response that we would have [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=70.0s)]
*  if somebody was going to advise us on how we might respond [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=72.28s)]
*  in terms of defending ourselves. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=75.62s)]
*  And so I think that's, you know, it's nice, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=77.08s)]
*  but ultimately the Israelis are going to do what they think is best for them. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=79.74s)]
*  I guess that's where the escalating fears come in, General. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=83.06s)]
*  All right, I know you and I have talked about this before, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=86.28s)]
*  that assuming that Israel is attacked either directly or indirectly [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=88.28s)]
*  through some of these proxies by Iran, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  it is almost assuredly going to respond. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=95.32000000000001s)]
*  It is already indicated that likely that would be within Iran itself, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=97.56s)]
*  maybe take out some of these nuclear facilities. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=101.26s)]
*  I guess our reading into that is that is an escalation and all bets are off. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=103.76s)]
*  Do you concur? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=108.4s)]
*  Well, if you look at the region, the Houthis have been doing things, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  you know, it's been silent, but they're capable. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=115.1s)]
*  Then you've got ISIS operating out of Syria. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=117.56s)]
*  So, you know, I wouldn't say that Iran has been necessarily silent. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=119.44s)]
*  I mean, you can trace October 7th directly to them. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=123.48s)]
*  So, you know, their ability to escalate at this point [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=126.44s)]
*  in terms of real military force just really is limited to their proxies. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=130.78s)]
*  And I think the Israelis can handle that. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=135.48s)]
*  And furthermore, I think this is a good opportunity for us to think about [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=137.72s)]
*  taking out the nuclear capability that they're advancing. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=141.6s)]
*  They're close to getting weapons. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=143.96s)]
*  Do you think that invites the Russians or the Chinese to get involved? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=146.02s)]
*  Well, Neil, as I've said before, they're already involved. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=152.62s)]
*  They're supporting Iran. It's mutually supporting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=155.22s)]
*  They're supporting Iran, the Russians, both and the Chinese. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=158.06s)]
*  And the Chinese are supporting both with resources. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=161.36s)]
*  So this is already happening. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=163.9s)]
*  It's almost kind of theater to think that we would, you know, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  restrain ourselves from defending what has been active attacks [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=169.78s)]
*  that have been ongoing since October 7th in the region. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=174.18s)]
*  On the start of this war, more to the point on October 7th, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=178.24s)]
*  you know, General, stepping back to something that Christopher Wray [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=181.68s)]
*  was mentioning in testimony this week, where he detailed all these terror threats [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=184.52s)]
*  and not saying they're all, you know, being triggered by what's going on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=188.18s)]
*  in the Middle East, but that's sort of galvanizing a lot of bad guys, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=191.36s)]
*  essentially, all over the world. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=194.56s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=196.5s)]
*  I am. I do agree with it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=198.84s)]
*  But I'm more concerned about the fact that we've let millions across our border. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=200.98000000000002s)]
*  So now you couple the fact that there is a legitimate threat [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=205.12s)]
*  and you've got millions of people operating in the country [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=208.56s)]
*  that potentially could be part of that threat. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=211.32000000000002s)]
*  That's the thing I think that concerns me. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=213.46s)]
*  Moreover, I think just in terms of FISA, I do think it's OK [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=215.56s)]
*  to want a warrant when it involves a U.S. citizen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=220.9s)]
*  And I'm not sure why we couldn't get there. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  You know, you mentioned these terror threats at the border. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=226.66s)]
*  Of course, you're familiar with this Afghan national, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=229.61999999999998s)]
*  you know, who was on the terror watch list, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=232.7s)]
*  who was let go twice. Now he's finally back in custody. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=236.23999999999998s)]
*  But every time I hear stories like that, General, I worry about the ones [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  who did get away and who were released. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=242.94s)]
*  Unfortunately, you know, law enforcement, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=247.94s)]
*  particularly as we're dealing with illegal aliens in the country, has been lax. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=250.17999999999998s)]
*  I mean, you look at the guy that is a repeat offender, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=255.14000000000001s)]
*  just stole a boat in New York and they let him out [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=258.66s)]
*  and he's just tried to steal another one. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=261.86s)]
*  So this is going on in all our major cities. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=263.5s)]
*  And so when you couple that with this terror threat, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=266.1s)]
*  it's kind of terrifying to note that our law enforcement [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=268.7s)]
*  just isn't what it should be. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=271.34000000000003s)]
*  And that's a part of our defense. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=272.9s)]
*  You know, General, one of the great things I enjoy about talking to you [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=276.24s)]
*  is that you're sweeping sets of history, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=279.24s)]
*  particularly military history and terror history. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  And what scares me about this, and it hit me when I even talked to my kids, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=284.52s)]
*  a couple of whom were born after 9 11. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=290.0s)]
*  And so for this and for them, this is the stuff that's in history books. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=292.59999999999997s)]
*  Guys like our age, of course, we lived through it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=298.09999999999997s)]
*  It defined who we are and how we think. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=300.08s)]
*  And I wonder whether we're getting too sanguine about this, too, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=302.84s)]
*  you know, relaxed about, oh, yeah, the terror threat. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=307.02s)]
*  We get it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=308.94s)]
*  Even what Christopher Ray was saying kind of fell on on deaf ears. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=310.08s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it's a threat we heard about. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=314.32s)]
*  Yeah, we heard about the Moscow attack in the theater and all that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=315.94s)]
*  I guess it could happen here, but almost like a shrugged shoulder response. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=319.78s)]
*  What did you make of that? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=324.06s)]
*  Well, we're blending now all the elements of the terror war [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=326.86s)]
*  with all of the challenges we faced during the first cold water, the Cold War. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=331.46s)]
*  They're coming together, both the nuclear threat, a cyber threat, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=335.5s)]
*  infrastructure threat, and then you have the terror threat. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=339.7s)]
*  So and we're just not prepared, I think, at this point, because of, you know, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=342.76s)]
*  the covid and what it did to our economy, you know, the inflation. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=347.44s)]
*  We're just our industrial base. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=352.5s)]
*  There are so many things that we're behind the eight ball on. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=354.3s)]
*  Whereas, you know, for both those situations, the Cold War and the war on terror, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=357.58s)]
*  we were actually kind of at the height of our game. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=362.68s)]
*  Now we're kind of on the back foot on both elements. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=364.78000000000003s)]
*  So big global national threat from from the Cold War type threats. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=369.4s)]
*  And then you have these terror threats that that are they've never really gone away. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=374.9s)]
*  So, yeah, it's probably one of the most challenging times in our country [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=378.74s)]
*  from a national security perspective that we face. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=382.4s)]
*  Yeah, we're so used to the warnings that we tend to ignore them. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=385.18s)]
*  General, thank you more for your incredible service to this country, sir. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=388.53999999999996s)]
*  Rob Spaulding, U.S. Air Force Brigadier General, author of War Without Rules. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=392.28s)]
*  And remember, when it comes to terrorists, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E1qTs6YwUcM&t=396.28s)]
