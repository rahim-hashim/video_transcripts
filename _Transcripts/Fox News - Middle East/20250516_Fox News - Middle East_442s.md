# Trump calls for all hostages to be released in move toward peace: 'Positive things are happening'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE)
*  Here comes our father, here comes our father, and all of our love has returned to us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=0.0s)]
*  I made me remember that. That was an emotional reunion back in February and freed hostage [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=10.0s)]
*  Keith Siegel, celebrated with his family after spending 484 days in Hamas captivity. Now, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=15.620000000000001s)]
*  former hostages are calling on President Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  to move quickly to free the remaining hostages saying this, we are in dramatic hours that [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=27.159999999999997s)]
*  will determine the future of our loved ones, the future of Israeli society, and the future [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=33.28s)]
*  of the Middle East. Missing this historic opportunity for a deal to bring the hostages [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=39.04s)]
*  home would be a resounding failure that will be remembered in infamy forever. And freed [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=44.36s)]
*  hostage Keith Siegel joins us live and we're so glad to have you. Before we get started [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  with your story and your message today, I just want to play a little bit from President [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=55.44s)]
*  Trump about bringing hostages home. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=59.68s)]
*  I was told just before I left that they were going to be releasing Edan. We thought Edan [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=62.44s)]
*  was dead. Three weeks ago they said Edan was no longer living. And it was a very, very [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=67.24s)]
*  good thing. Ultimately all hostages of all nationalities must be released as a stepping [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=75.52s)]
*  stone to peace and I think it's going to be happening. A lot of things are happening. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=82.16s)]
*  A lot of very positive things are happening on every front. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=85.52s)]
*  And you still wear the T-shirt, the Bring Them Home Now. And we want to just open it [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=89.36s)]
*  up to you about your reflections today and your concern about those who are still held. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=94.32s)]
*  I am so, so happy that Edan Alexander was released and I am very grateful to President [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  Trump for making that incredible achievement and of course for getting me home. Most of [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=106.84s)]
*  the time in captivity negotiations were stalled and it didn't look like anything was making [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=115.68s)]
*  any progress and I was worried when and if I would ever make it back. Things changed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=122.28s)]
*  when President Trump was elected. Negotiations got on track and I and many others were released [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=128.8s)]
*  back to our families. I am eternally grateful for that. I urge President Trump and Prime [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu and the mediating countries to get negotiations on track and reach an [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=143.04s)]
*  agreement that will bring all of the 58 hostages that are still in Gaza back home as soon as [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=151.95999999999998s)]
*  possible. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=157.04s)]
*  I have some specific questions about your experience. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=158.16s)]
*  On October 7th did you think going into Gaza with a mosque that I can survive this or were [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=165.64s)]
*  you thinking I just saw the last of my days? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=172.38s)]
*  From the 7th of October and throughout the whole 484 days that I was in captivity I promised [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=177.5s)]
*  myself that I would survive and make it back to my family. I didn't feel that there was [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  an alternative as far as I am concerned. Thinking about the suffering that my family [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=192.08s)]
*  was going through while I was there and just feeling that I must survive and get back to [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=199.08s)]
*  them that they will not have to live with that suffering and not knowing what happened [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=208.12s)]
*  to me for the rest of their lives. My wife Aviva and I were kidnapped together on October [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  7th. We spent 51 days together in captivity. She was released after 51 days and then I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=220.0s)]
*  was held on and off half a year on my own and the rest of the time with other hostages. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=230.24s)]
*  You've got some things you want to show our audience and let's give you a chance to do [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=236.24s)]
*  that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=239.24s)]
*  This is Matan, Matan Angrest. Matan and I were held together locked in a room for 67 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=242.0s)]
*  days. We formed a very close relationship. We helped each other survive. We helped each [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=248.4s)]
*  other get through each day. Both of us suffered abuse. We suffered violence, physical violence [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=254.68s)]
*  of many kinds. Terrible abuse that I never imagined people were capable of doing and [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=262.74s)]
*  that people would have to live through this. This is Matan, what he looked like on October [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=271.4s)]
*  7th and this is Matan and what he looked like in July after he was interrogated by [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=277.92s)]
*  Hamas. You can see. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=284.92s)]
*  Almost a different person with all the abuse. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=288.88s)]
*  A different person. Doctors have seen these pictures and have testified that Matan was [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=291.0s)]
*  beaten and he suffered fractures in his face and he was severely burned on October 7th. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=297.08000000000004s)]
*  Matan has not received the medical attention that he needs from October 7th and we're now [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=304.44s)]
*  at 588 days of the war. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=309.76s)]
*  You mentioned 58. We have numbers of 59 hostages of whom 35 are considered dead. So that's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=313.12s)]
*  roughly 24 that are assumed to be alive today. Do we know if Matan is alive? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=321.56s)]
*  Hamas put out a video about a month ago. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=328.2s)]
*  As of a month ago. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=333.47999999999996s)]
*  As of a month ago if that video was actually taken when they said it was. But in the video [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=334.44s)]
*  I saw a completely different person. Matan looked in all ways physical, emotional, psychological, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=340.36s)]
*  just completely different. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=348.76s)]
*  I pray that you will be reunited with him one day and that's one of your messages. Today [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=349.91999999999996s)]
*  also when you were in captivity you would think about eating your family's recipe, the [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=354.38s)]
*  pancakes. And the pancakes became a thing and everybody wanted to have these pancakes [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=359.97999999999996s)]
*  and today at 12 chairs which is a restaurant downtown, Israeli restaurant downtown here [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=364.5s)]
*  in New York, I guess are serving pancakes all day long in order to bring this attention [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=369.58s)]
*  to it. Tell us a little bit about that. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=375.26s)]
*  The pancake house will be open from 10 until 3 p.m. today. The pancake project which was [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=377.74s)]
*  initiated by my daughter and thinking about the many wonderful family times that we had [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=389.21999999999997s)]
*  together eating pancakes and it brought a more personal aspect of our past and she thought [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=398.46s)]
*  it would connect people and get them engaged in the efforts to return all of the hostages [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=406.46s)]
*  and I really, really want to stress today the urgency of getting all of the 58 hostages [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=414.38s)]
*  that are still in Gaza back home as soon as possible. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=420.7s)]
*  Keith you're a strong man. Thank you for sharing your story. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vSaSmni-dGE&t=424.17999999999995s)]
