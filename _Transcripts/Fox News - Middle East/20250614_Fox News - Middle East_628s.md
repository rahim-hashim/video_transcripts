*  to reporters, but as US allies, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  including the head of Israel, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  regarding the situation we have yet [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=308.28s)]
*  though to hear from the president on camera today. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=310.16s)]
*  We've got that big military parade, Brian. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=311.76s)]
*  So we'll look to see if the president says [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=313.64000000000004s)]
*  anything as he attends the festivities. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=315.0s)]
*  Brian. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=317.0s)]
*  Mark Meredith live at the White House. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  Mark, thank you. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=319.04s)]
*  With more now on the continuing attacks, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=320.68s)]
*  Brent Sadler, senior research fellow [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  at the Heritage Foundation and retired US Navy captain. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=325.08000000000004s)]
*  Brent, thank you so much for being here. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  A lot to discuss. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=330.36s)]
*  Israel has damaged Iran's nuclear capability. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=332.0s)]
*  To what extent? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=335.88s)]
*  We're not entirely sure quite yet. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=337.08000000000004s)]
*  If Israel does not, I guess the way to say this is, [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=339.96s)]
*  would it be a failure, this mission a failure, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=343.08s)]
*  if they do not completely eliminate Iran's ability [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=346.36s)]
*  to develop a nuclear weapon? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=350.04s)]
*  Yeah, thanks for having me on. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=353.36s)]
*  And again, happy birthday to the army. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=354.48s)]
*  They turned 250 today. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=356.56s)]
*  And the question is an important one [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=358.6s)]
*  and it was always going to be very risky [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=360.88s)]
*  on Israel or anyone else to try to take out [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=363.52s)]
*  Iran's nuclear enterprise, their weapons program. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=366.04s)]
*  And the only way that there's any sure, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=369.56s)]
*  a surety that you got everything [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=371.52s)]
*  is getting access to the documents [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=373.2s)]
*  and as well as all the sites to prove [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=375.36s)]
*  that you've destroyed it or degraded it completely. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=377.4s)]
*  So we're never gonna get a satisfactory answer [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=380.88s)]
*  until we've got that boots on the ground, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=383.72s)]
*  inspector boots that is, inside Iran to verify [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=385.76s)]
*  that everything has been destroyed. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=390.64s)]
*  If it's not, then it's just a question about [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=392.36s)]
*  how long till Iran reconstitutes. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=395.24s)]
*  And the question of success or failure [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=398.0s)]
*  is something that's gonna be judged either in months [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=400.28s)]
*  or years depending on what type of Iran or Iranian regime [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=402.88s)]
*  comes out the other side of this conflict. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  Brett, what should the United States do now [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=410.28s)]
*  in terms of helping Israel? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=412.28s)]
*  We obviously, the president, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=413.8s)]
*  based on the president's comments, [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=414.96s)]
*  we were aware of these attacks, we gave the green light, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=416.32s)]
*  we've helped him in the defense [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=418.48s)]
*  from these ballistic missile attacks. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=421.2s)]
*  What should the United States do next? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=423.2s)]
*  Should they provide the bunker buster weaponry needed [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=425.88s)]
*  to completely eliminate the nuclear capabilities of Iran? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=429.8s)]
*  Should we take a next step if they're not willing [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=433.76s)]
*  to come to the negotiating table, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=436.64s)]
*  which as of now, doesn't seem like they are? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  It's just to restate, I think the course [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=441.64s)]
*  that's been laid out and what the president has restated [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=443.76s)]
*  numerous times is the preference [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=446.64s)]
*  and what is in America's best interest [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=448.4s)]
*  is not to get directly involved in a conflict with Iran, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=450.48s)]
*  but at the same time, this regime must not be allowed [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=453.48s)]
*  to have a nuclear weapon to include any level of processing [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=456.68s)]
*  or refinement of uranium. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=460.88s)]
*  So that is the objective. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=462.72s)]
*  If it requires putting on the table for Israel [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=464.68s)]
*  to get more capable weapon systems, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=467.72s)]
*  I think that is something that should be done. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=471.12s)]
*  I'm not sure that's necessary for success, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=473.8s)]
*  but again, the longer that the regime in Tehran decides [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=477.12s)]
*  to take a very belligerent posture [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  and not enter into negotiations [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=483.36s)]
*  to end that nuclear program of theirs, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the pressure will have to go up. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=487.88s)]
*  I think the Israelis are prepared to do that, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=491.15999999999997s)]
*  especially coming in the coming days [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=493.64s)]
*  if Iran doesn't show up on Sunday [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=495.76s)]
*  for the six round of talks. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=498.24s)]
*  So the risk here obviously is further escalation. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=500.32s)]
*  So what do you think Iran does next? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=503.44s)]
*  We've already had, we've seen reports [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  of Iranian lawmakers talking about threatening, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=507.8s)]
*  shutting down the Strait of Hormuz, [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=510.92s)]
*  which would affect the economy, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  not quite as much as it would have years ago. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=517.08s)]
*  Our dependence on oil is less, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=519.32s)]
*  but nonetheless, do you expect Iran [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=522.0400000000001s)]
*  to shut down the Strait of Hormuz? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=524.72s)]
*  Do you expect them, or if not, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=527.0400000000001s)]
*  what else do you expect them to do? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=528.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, so first on the Strait of Hormuz, in years past, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=532.0s)]
*  the Iranians use that as blackmail. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=535.4399999999999s)]
*  They would threaten the United States [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=538.48s)]
*  of shutting or cutting off the oil flow [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=540.36s)]
*  through the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=542.92s)]
*  That doesn't really bother us as much [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=544.04s)]
*  as it does our allies in Europe and in Northeast Asia. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=546.04s)]
*  So it's not a direct American, I guess, concern, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=549.84s)]
*  as so to speak. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=553.0s)]
*  So the leverage that the Iranian regime has is lesser there. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=554.24s)]
*  What really is a concern, I think, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=557.52s)]
*  on what could come next from the Iranians, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=560.04s)]
*  if they so choose to escalate, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=562.4s)]
*  is they might activate their sleeper cells, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=566.36s)]
*  their terrorist allies around the world [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=567.6s)]
*  or in the United States through years of open borders [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=570.6s)]
*  to hurt the United States directly [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=574.52s)]
*  or to go after Israeli interests here and or abroad. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=576.6800000000001s)]
*  I think that is highly likely, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=580.28s)]
*  though would be extremely escalatory [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=583.32s)]
*  and is one of the circumstances [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=585.44s)]
*  that the president also kind of insinuated [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=587.4s)]
*  would trigger an American response. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=590.28s)]
*  So other than the ballistic missiles, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=592.12s)]
*  that's really the only other option the Iranians have. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=596.0400000000001s)]
*  It sounds like you think escalation is likely here, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=598.12s)]
*  not de-escalation, at least in the short term, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=601.5600000000001s)]
*  based on what you were just telling us, Brent. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=603.88s)]
*  I, that's correct? Yes. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=606.0400000000001s)]
*  Yes, okay. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O6QWlVTAH-8&t=607.9200000000001s)]
