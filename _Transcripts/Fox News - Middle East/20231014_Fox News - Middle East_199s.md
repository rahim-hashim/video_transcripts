# US cities remain on alert after ‘day of rage’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8)
*  All right, major cities are pretty much around the world right now under varying degrees [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=0.0s)]
*  of high alerts, and you always probably wonder what that means. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=7.42s)]
*  We in the New York metropolitan area know pretty well what that means. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=10.26s)]
*  Ray Kelly, the former New York Police Commissioner, kind enough to join us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=13.98s)]
*  Ray, it's always good learning from you on this, but a lot of people do get panicked [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=17.5s)]
*  and they start looking at every street corner, they start wondering, uh-oh, what's up? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=21.86s)]
*  How do you tell them and what do you tell them? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=25.82s)]
*  Well, I think you keep the public informed as much as you can as far as the information [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=29.94s)]
*  that you have. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=36.84s)]
*  You deploy your resources to places, let's say houses of worship or places where you [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=38.44s)]
*  have some intelligence that might be of a concern to you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=44.900000000000006s)]
*  You make certain that your investigators, like in New York City here, we have a joint [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=49.6s)]
*  with the FBI that you're sort of in lockstep, that you're working together. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=55.64s)]
*  But it is very, very difficult in this environment to protect, say, a city here that has 10 million [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=61.8s)]
*  people in it during a work day. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=68.56s)]
*  So you do the best you can to, again, raise that comfort level for the public and use [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=71.78s)]
*  your resources as effectively as possible. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=77.92s)]
*  But of course, there are no guarantees. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=80.4s)]
*  We had to do this many times in New York City and we had 16 plots against the city [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=82.92s)]
*  during the Bloomberg administration and we've had lone wolf terrorism attacks just a few [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=89.24000000000001s)]
*  hundred yards from where I am now. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=95.0s)]
*  So New York is a perennial target and I think the police certainly realize that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=97.16s)]
*  You know, there was an incident earlier at the Louvre Museum where French authorities [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=103.76s)]
*  had to clear it out after a phoned-in threat. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=107.02000000000001s)]
*  I don't know where that ultimately went, but that's a museum where that happened. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=109.56s)]
*  Earlier, of course, yesterday you heard about this French incident. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=113.72s)]
*  They're already deeming it a terrorist incident where a teacher was knifed to death. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=118.76s)]
*  So these incidents pop up around the world, blessedly few, but they trigger further incidents. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=124.08s)]
*  And I'm just wondering how you monitor that. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=131.0s)]
*  Well, I think you try to look at the individuals involved and see if you have any information [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=134.84s)]
*  on them. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=140.28s)]
*  Are they associated with a group or an organization? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=141.28s)]
*  And it's important to monitor these events. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=145.8s)]
*  I know they do that in the NYPD and other major police departments. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=148.56s)]
*  You try to learn everything you can from things that are happening overseas. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=153.52s)]
*  There's something happening virtually every day as far as terrorism is concerned. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=158.92s)]
*  It's really a case where intelligence units have a treasure trove of information to look at. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=164.24s)]
*  They have almost too much to look at. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=173.92s)]
*  It's hard to sift through it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=176.07999999999998s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=179.88s)]
*  You got us through it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  Hopefully calm, cool heads like yours will get us through this next wave. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ddX6To5iS8&t=182.07999999999998s)]
