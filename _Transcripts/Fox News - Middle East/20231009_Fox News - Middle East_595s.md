# Israeli describes collecting DNA samples to identify deceased
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo)
*  Joining us now from Israel with very personal story is Roz Shmelovich [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=0.0s)]
*  He lost several friends in the attack on Saturday and was going door-to-door to help his community Roz [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=5.36s)]
*  Thank you for joining us [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=11.28s)]
*  I know the reason that you're going door-to-door is to collect samples of DNA [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  So that bodies that have been found in this carnage can be identified and matched to family members [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=17.44s)]
*  What what is the situation there for you on the ground right now? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=23.36s)]
*  Hi, how are we doing? Thank you very much [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=30.4s)]
*  Situation on the ground now as civilian who is living in the closest easily community that the Gaza Strait border [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=34.88s)]
*  is kind of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=43.2s)]
*  Horrible most of the people in my community [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  We are a community of a thousand people have been evacuated from the community today. It's almost empty. There's nobody there [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=50.44s)]
*  Yesterday we as you said you finished identifying [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  In the order to identify the dead bodies we had to go into the victims houses to collect toothbrushes or [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=62.24s)]
*  Hairbrushes or any dirty clothes that might have sweat on them or DNA samples of any kind [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=69.16s)]
*  You're entering houses that were seen of murder a couple of minutes before that a couple of hours or days [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=75.88s)]
*  So you're talking about areas full of blood still on the ground [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=82.08s)]
*  Animals dogs that are shot and spending their four days [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=86.44s)]
*  frightening [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=91.08s)]
*  Shattered glasses and this is a quiet [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=92.75999999999999s)]
*  No one residential community that was my house in still is my house when I come back there [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=95.19999999999999s)]
*  Raj so sorry for everything that you are experiencing in all of your losses and for everything that you all are going through [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=102.39999999999999s)]
*  And it is obviously very difficult to hear everything that you just described [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=109.72s)]
*  What are you hearing from those people who are there when you go house to house if you do see anyone there? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=114.32s)]
*  You don't hear much because most people are not there when you go to the house [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=124.36s)]
*  It's because somebody who lived there either was murdered or still in hospital [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=128.04s)]
*  And who the ones you do see there is the beloved one their son their daughter their parents are coming to get the sample and they have [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=131.6s)]
*  to encounter [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=138.95999999999998s)]
*  blood [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=140.32s)]
*  Which is the blood of their dear son on the ground so [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=141.52s)]
*  The ones you do encounter and their worst time is their life if I can get plastic for a moment [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=144.44s)]
*  So I had to find somebody young one of my neighbors in his 50s trying to clean the blood [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=150.60000000000002s)]
*  Of his father from the ground and he couldn't help he couldn't deal with it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=155.72s)]
*  So we literally left the house which left me to do that [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=158.76000000000002s)]
*  So you have to stand there in in a house a neighbor or friend to cleaning puddles of blood [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  Then you can trace that the murder track where the victim was sitting on the couch [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=167.72s)]
*  She tried to run away [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=172.56s)]
*  She was shot again in a different spot and you can literally trace that and that's just horrible horrible talking about [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=173.72s)]
*  civilians all [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=180.92000000000002s)]
*  People in the 70s sitting in their houses water to death by people or Hamas [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=182.4s)]
*  Terrorists to for some reason I keep being called militants. Those are terrorists and you know [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=187.6s)]
*  There's nothing that more than those when I saw your reporter earlier on in the water which is a hometown next to where I live [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=192.54s)]
*  I was like welcome to my life. I have to go to a school my kids go to school [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=200.14s)]
*  which is a bomb shelter sounds of alarms and [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=205.73999999999998s)]
*  explosive sounds landing by is our [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=209.62s)]
*  soundtrack of our life [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=213.01999999999998s)]
*  Yes, I know living living in that area you under you are under a constant threat [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=214.73999999999998s)]
*  There's no question about that and I was in Israel in [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=220.45999999999998s)]
*  2006 during the war with Hezbollah and I was just so taken with the tenacity and the strength that the Israeli people show [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=224.7s)]
*  In the face of threats. I remember up in Metula, which is where we were staying [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=233.98s)]
*  there was a grandmother who was running the hotel Arraza in there and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=239.29999999999998s)]
*  she was the the toughest person that you could ever imagine as the rockets were falling all around and and [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=242.82s)]
*  Journalists were running for cover [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=248.74s)]
*  She was still there behind the front desk at the hotel and she sort of looked at everybody running away and tisk tisk [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=250.26000000000002s)]
*  Tisks us for not wanting to stand there in the face of the the threat that was coming our way [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=256.34000000000003s)]
*  In terms of what you were hearing from the leadership there in Israel [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=262.22s)]
*  We are expecting the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to make remarks in the next [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=267.42s)]
*  Couple of hours probably at the very least [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=274.5s)]
*  What do you think about the response so far from the leadership there? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=278.02s)]
*  Are you hearing enough about what's happening and what's to come? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=282.26s)]
*  To be honest, we don't hear anything at all if you feel and you hear is the absence of any official [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=288.46s)]
*  comment as the victim community of the committee that suffered a massacre [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=296.29999999999995s)]
*  Nobody from the official government have contacted us. They'll still kidnap persons [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=301.74s)]
*  I'm guessing our leaders. I'm hoping our leaders are working on a solution [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=307.06s)]
*  So then busy running the war and have no mistake. It is a war [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=312.02s)]
*  But I want to hear I want to hear that this time it's going to be a whole different scenario [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=317.94s)]
*  We are not expecting another [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=323.5s)]
*  Heat from the air and let's blow down some [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=325.7s)]
*  Some towers and some buildings they'll come they will fight back [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=329.58s)]
*  you know what what took us a complete surprise on Saturday and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=332.9s)]
*  Actually almost broke the spirit of Israel's but as you just mentioned we are strong [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=337.9s)]
*  We've suffered the trauma that has not been [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=343.66s)]
*  At least not by generation not been [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=347.02s)]
*  Experienced yet, maybe even bigger than the Yom Kippur in 73 [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=350.38s)]
*  But it took us two days and now we are gaining back our powers [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=354.7s)]
*  armies well organized back [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=359.18s)]
*  Recruiting reserves our spirits are high. We're working on our we're working on our [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=361.86s)]
*  Resilience on our minds and we are starting to be stronger. This is the mindset [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=368.5s)]
*  We have like the old lady you mentioned this is us will stand back on our legs and who comes to kill us [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=371.9s)]
*  We will be killed first. We are strong [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  We will come out of it stronger and anybody who does but murder Jews in their home and slaughtered and you mentioned [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=379.74s)]
*  260 people murdered [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=387.14s)]
*  260 Jews slaughtered in the forests in the woods [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=389.34s)]
*  Those of us are second or third generation to Holocaust survivors know about those stories who took place in Babi are in other areas [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=393.06s)]
*  What Jews were rounded out in the forest and shot? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=400.14s)]
*  Oh [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=403.18s)]
*  Already there we said never again and those images and somebody who traveled a couple of times to death camps in Poland and heard those stories [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=404.38s)]
*  Echoed in my head and I cannot do anything but say today the Jews have a state a land an army and allies [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=412.34s)]
*  Never again, they should not happen again the victims 260 Jews slaughtered solely for being Jews will not happen again [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=420.46s)]
*  This time would not need the world to do our job [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=427.5s)]
*  We have our own people to do it [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=430.65999999999997s)]
*  We do know that we are anticipating as John just mentioned that we could hear from the Israeli Prime Minister anytime now [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=433.58s)]
*  this as [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=440.94s)]
*  Reports a ground invasion could be happening very soon [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=442.7s)]
*  Crossing the wires a short time ago the Hamas military spokesman saying it will kill a civilian hostage anytime [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=446.42s)]
*  Israel targets Gaza civilians without warning [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=453.42s)]
*  We know what we heard from the Israeli Prime Minister on Sunday telling him the president the US President [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=457.14s)]
*  Biden that Israel does not have any choice but to unleash a ground operation in Gaza saying quote [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=462.86s)]
*  We have to go in according to the Israeli leader. What do you expect the next couple of hours to look like Roz? I [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=469.06s)]
*  Fear I truly fear the next hours none of the options we have on the table [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=479.82s)]
*  Are not good for anybody in war nobody wins there's only losers, but this war was forced on us and [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=485.06s)]
*  in war we pay prices and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=492.54s)]
*  You know just think that you actually these are the kidnapped soldier a couple of years ago [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  We released a thousand terrorists for one soldier of ours [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=499.74s)]
*  Now I think it's gloves off. I expect that ground invasion is not necessarily what I personally would have done [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=503.78000000000003s)]
*  I know the costs but I would say anybody with who dares to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=509.46000000000004s)]
*  Execute an Israeli civilian [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=513.74s)]
*  under captivity which is [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=516.34s)]
*  Against so many international laws means gloves off on our side as well [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=518.9s)]
*  I would expect our leadership to take the gloves off as well if Israeli civilian blood is allowed [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=523.0600000000001s)]
*  So be it and the other side blood is allowed as well the moment Hamas terrorist [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=529.1s)]
*  executes an Israeli [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=535.22s)]
*  Civilian I [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=537.62s)]
*  Hope the anger will be unleashed and either we use all the power it has [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=539.02s)]
*  including every means [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=544.02s)]
*  Ground ground invasion in my opinion is too risky for us [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=546.22s)]
*  Why risk our own people if I can flatten down neighborhoods, you know, you know, why risk our people? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=549.76s)]
*  I would have given the Palestinians who think they're not part of Hamas a warning get out of this area [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nw88g6ZbOEo&t=555.1800000000001s)]
