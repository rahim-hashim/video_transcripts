# Benjamin Netanyahu: We can't guarantee that forces over darkness won't overcome forces of good
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 16, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k)
*  Welcome back, America. We have a special guest, the former prime minister of Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=0.0s)]
*  Hopefully people know where I stand on this, the future prime minister of Israel, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=5.08s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. He has a fantastic book out, B.B. My Story. This is his first [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=8.84s)]
*  exclusive interview and we're actually giving the prime minister time to talk [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=14.52s)]
*  about it. Everything you hear us discussing is actually in the book in an [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=18.72s)]
*  expanded way. It's very, very intriguing. Mr. Prime Minister, you have a section in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=22.64s)]
*  the book, actually throughout the book, you talk about power, you talk about [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=28.44s)]
*  leadership, what it takes. You talk about the Siren Triangle, hard power, soft power. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=33.6s)]
*  What do you mean by all that? Look, we live in a very troubled world, a world in [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=38.32s)]
*  crisis. The crisis in Ukraine can, you know, roll out in ominous ways. We have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=42.96s)]
*  Iran racing to a nuclear arsenal. We have terrorism that abounds everywhere. So how [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=50.88s)]
*  do you stabilize this? How do you get peace here? Now, there are those who [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=56.52s)]
*  believe that the way to do that is through soft power. That is, that the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=61.56s)]
*  superiority of our values, our commitment to democracy, to morality and so on, will [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=65.2s)]
*  overcome the, you know, will assure that the arc of history, as Martin Luther King [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=71.2s)]
*  had said, bends towards justice. Well, I think it's a brittle arc and it can [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=77.12s)]
*  break under the pounding of the darkest of forces of medievalism, of Islamist [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=83.44s)]
*  radicalism and others. So I believe that soft power by itself, without the backing [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=88.2s)]
*  of hard power, hard power meaning military power and strong economic power, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=94.84s)]
*  without hard power, soft power is useless. And we cannot guarantee that the forces [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=99.88s)]
*  of darkness will not overcome the forces of good. I mean, Lincoln spoke about the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=106.2s)]
*  better angels of our nature in his famous speech, but he had to defeat the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=110.6s)]
*  Confederacy in one of the bloodiest battles of wars of American history to [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  give those angels an opportunity. You need hard power. If there's one lesson [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=121.24s)]
*  in the world today, you understand, is that free democratic countries have to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=127.0s)]
*  be strong and have to have the leadership to apply strength judiciously, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=131.64s)]
*  but to apply it against those that seek our destruction or the destruction of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  our way of life. So I devoted a good part of my life to ensuring that Israel, the [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=142.96s)]
*  country of the Jewish people, who didn't have any power for centuries and were [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=148.0s)]
*  massacred, pogromed, exiled, leading to the worst massacre of the war, the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=152.96s)]
*  Holocaust, that we would never be defenseless and that we would have the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=157.84s)]
*  The problem was you need an army. Everybody understood that. But the other [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=162.08s)]
*  problem is that F-35s, submarines, drones, intelligence, cyber, it all costs money. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=166.84s)]
*  Where do you get the money? The only way that you get a money, in my view, was not [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  through high-tax socialist economy that Israel had, was basically was to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=178.16000000000003s)]
*  transform it through a free market revolution into a capitalist economy. And [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=185.10000000000002s)]
*  I devoted much of my time as finance minister, I served in that capacity as [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=190.72s)]
*  well, and prime minister, to effect a free market revolution in Israel, not [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=196.72s)]
*  only because I believe in it, but because it was the indispensable instrument to [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=201.84s)]
*  give Israel the means to shore up its military, its intelligence, its [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=206.16s)]
*  cyber capabilities. And what happened was that the combination of Israeli [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=212.12s)]
*  civilian technology, which is outstanding, and Israeli military [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=216.72s)]
*  technology, which is outstanding, gave us a third power, which is diplomatic power. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=220.44s)]
*  Countries started coming to Israel because they needed us. We didn't have [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=226.68s)]
*  to go to them because we needed them. That placed Israel, just had its rise on [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=230.52s)]
*  the ladder of the nations. And we are ranked, I don't know if you know this, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=235.68s)]
*  but Israel's GDP, because of the free market reforms that I enacted, has just [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=240.44s)]
*  surpassed Britain, France, Japan, Canada, and most recently Germany, because [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  free markets work. And we are ranked by the University of Pennsylvania poll that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=253.51999999999998s)]
*  ranks 20,000 opinion leaders in many countries. Consistently between 2015 and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=258.96s)]
*  2020, Israel, with one-tenth of one percent of the world's population, is [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=264.24s)]
*  ranked number eight in the world powers. That tells you that this thing works. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=269.36s)]
*  So that's what I did. And the Arab countries in the Gulf in particular took [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=275.0s)]
*  note. And when they saw Israel strong, strong militarily, standing up to Iran, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=280.2s)]
*  strong economically, with civilian technology that they want for their [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=284.92s)]
*  peoples, that was really what produced the, I would say, the foundation for the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=289.04s)]
*  historic Abraham Accords, the four peace treaties that we had with Arab states. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=295.2s)]
*  And of course, President Trump's team and the president himself helped finish [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=298.52s)]
*  that. But you should know that the meetings that I had with the Gulf leaders, [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=302.68s)]
*  and I write this in the book, took place after I gave the speech in 2015 in the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=307.76s)]
*  U.S. in a joint session of Congress against the Iran deal. That's when we got [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=314.4s)]
*  the phone calls. That's when they said, could we meet? And we did meet in secret [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=318.96s)]
*  meetings. And that really produced the foundation of the of the historic peace [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=323.47999999999996s)]
*  Accords. Peace through strength, the iron triangle of strength. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=328.0s)]
*  In fact, Milton Friedman noticed you back in 2005. We know who Milton Friedman is [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=332.48s)]
*  here. And he said, among other things, that Israel was a socialist state. And he [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=340.32s)]
*  said, and until it stops becoming a socialist state, it's not going to [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=345.84s)]
*  succeed. And it's not going to succeed economically in so many other ways. He [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=350.8s)]
*  certainly has the capacity. And he says, fortunately, Finance Minister Benjamin [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=354.68s)]
*  Netanyahu, who specialized in economic issues, understands the problem and is [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=360.32s)]
*  willing to use his political capital to bring a solution. That's way back in [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=365.12s)]
*  2005. You also, you went to MIT. You are highly educated here in the United States, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=368.52s)]
*  as a matter of fact. And I want to pursue some of this when we come back. Your [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=377.24s)]
*  experiences in the United States and I want the American people to know that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=382.0s)]
*  you also served in the most special of special forces in Israel, as did your [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=386.32s)]
*  brother, Yoni. And I want to talk about that a little bit as well. The book is [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChbNyag_V8k&t=390.16s)]
