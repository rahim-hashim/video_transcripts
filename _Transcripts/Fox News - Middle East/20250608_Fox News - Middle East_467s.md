# Lawmaker warns of implications to warfare amid Ukraine drone strike
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw)
*  Joining me now House Foreign Affairs Committee chair emeritus Michael McCaul good to have you back on the show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. So let's start there in Russia [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=5.0s)]
*  These strikes continue back and forth Ukraine pulling off this huge surprise drone attack Russia responding as we expected [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=7.0s)]
*  They would they're growing questions about whether Putin wants peace. I know that you don't think that he does [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=13.42s)]
*  Politico magazine has this assessment [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=18.48s)]
*  They say Putin will never abandon his ambition of conquering Ukraine and convincing him to do [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=20.38s)]
*  So shouldn't be the aim of Ukraine's global supporters. You can't make Putin walk away from Ukraine [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=25.74s)]
*  You have to put Ukraine out of his reach. Do you agree and how do we do that? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=31.54s)]
*  No, I do I think we have to be clear-eyed as to who mr. Putin is [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=35.32s)]
*  He has not come to the negotiating table [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=38.58s)]
*  He's not called for ceasefire like Zelensky and if you look at the targets that were hit by Ukraine [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=41.18s)]
*  These were the the bombers that carry the crews missiles the very targets that would kill civilians in Ukraine as opposed to what? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=47.26s)]
*  Putin's targets right [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=55.3s)]
*  apartment complex buildings schools, you know maternity hospitals and churches [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=57.14s)]
*  Killing civilians is an act of it's a criminal act actually according to the Geneva Convention [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=62.58s)]
*  So it's a very different playing field. How do we get them to the table though? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=68.38s)]
*  I do think we need a negotiated settlement. We cannot we're not gonna have a storm to Berlin like World War two [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=71.86s)]
*  unconditional surrender so you have to put pressure how you do that secondary sanctions [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  Lindsey Graham has a bill if he passes it [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=84.27999999999999s)]
*  Tomorrow we'll pass it in the house. And secondly keep the flow of weapons going in to Ukraine to pressure [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  Mr. Putin to act in good faith. I have little confidence in him [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=94.11999999999999s)]
*  Well, what happened with those drone strikes? So I was raising a lot of questions more broadly about you know [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  When an adversary gets creative could we be worrying about the same thing here in the US? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  It took them 18 months to plan that the Wall Street Journal editorial board says this [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=108.88s)]
*  Americans are accustomed to wars fought far from home by a force of volunteers, but everyone in the US [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=112.8s)]
*  They predict will be on the front lines of the next conflict [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=118.28s)]
*  Ukraine did the US a favor by destroying bombers of a US adversary and [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  Sending America a wake-up call about its own complacency [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=126.0s)]
*  Are you worried about one of our enemies being able to pull off something similar on US soil? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=129.44s)]
*  I think what we saw take place was a mastermind [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=133.52s)]
*  Counter offensive it was a seismic change in modern warfare technology [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=136.88s)]
*  Where you can take a very inexpensive little drone and take out a very expensive big bomber that drops cruise missiles [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=142.16s)]
*  I mean it changes everything on its head and we I know the Pentagon's looking at this from a standpoint of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=150.2s)]
*  How can we defend to do this? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=156.68s)]
*  We don't have the countermeasures to block these UAVs and we need to develop those because that will be the future [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=159.0s)]
*  Warfare, so you're worried that we are our military bases our [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=166.48s)]
*  Bombers are open to this kind of attack. I think you know we were seeing more and more drones in the air [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=170.44s)]
*  You know [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  Thousands of them now millions. I think this this will be what the terrorists use this will be what? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=177.16s)]
*  adversarial nations are going to use and I think the Pentagon as we pass reconciliation [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=183.64s)]
*  The money has to go towards these more modern warfare technologies not to these old [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=188.12s)]
*  You know ships that you know are just a remnant of World War two kind of the dinosaurs sure [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=193.12s)]
*  We need some of those, but we gotta be focused on the AI technology, okay? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=199.0s)]
*  So let's talk about Iran because we've got talks going on with them as well [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=202.84s)]
*  There have been news a la to have said there was some level of enrichment that we offered a deal President Trump [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=207.16s)]
*  You saw him. They're saying no way. There's not going to be any enrichment. He wants to get a deal done [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=212.72s)]
*  He said that diplomatically numerous times, but you heard him there and Lucas was reporting him saying [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=216.42s)]
*  You know we may have to do it the other way [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  What is that other way? What are the other options? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=224.55999999999997s)]
*  Well just with Prime Minister Netanyahu in the Middle East I had a very intense conversation with him. He has little [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=226.55999999999997s)]
*  Confidence that this deal is going to get reached and I agree with them [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=233.6s)]
*  They always delay Trump says zero enrichment. He's right about that because if they have enrichment they get a bomb [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=237.72s)]
*  So you know I think you have to give the diplomats a chance right and then when diplomacy breaks down you have war [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=244.11999999999998s)]
*  There's no question in my mind coming out of that meeting what mr. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=251.12s)]
*  Netanyahu's intentions are and that is to strike Iran when the negotiations go bad the question is going to be [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=254.56s)]
*  What will be the United States role, but also? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  Coordinating with the United States our allies and partners in the region because remember the retaliation from Iran will be severe [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=265.84s)]
*  And we have a lot of troops there US citizens there [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=273.0s)]
*  They'll hit Jordan they'll hit Saudi Arabia, and they'll hit Israel, and we were the only you know country [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=276.74s)]
*  Along with Israel that can stop all this from coming in Israel just can't do this alone [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=283.94s)]
*  Well, what would our role be and would it would it be something that would require congressional authorization? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=290.26s)]
*  Well, we have the AUMF so the president said he can't conduct a limited military [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=295.18s)]
*  Actions for a certain period of time then the authorized use of military forces kicked in then it comes to the Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=300.74s)]
*  Where we will deliberate that I don't think the president takes this decision lightly [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=308.82s)]
*  That will be his decision, but I think we cannot accept Iran to have a nuclear bomb [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=314.09999999999997s)]
*  And then therefore you know have we gone with the JCPOA 12 years ago [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=319.46s)]
*  Iran would have an atomic bomb today, and I'm so glad we stopped that when we did but what I told mr. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=324.44000000000005s)]
*  Netanyahu was you know they sent an emissary to the president [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  That's his decision, but at least coordinate with us if you go alone to respond to the retaliation coming out of Iran [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  I want to make sure before you go that we ask you about one domestic issue this has to do with Kilmer Obreggo Garcia [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=341.12s)]
*  He entered the country illegally through your state state of Texas was mistakenly deported to El Salvador [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  He's back now facing a slew of criminal charges and allegations that he was trafficking humans drugs weapons [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=353.28s)]
*  You know gang members all that kind of stuff Senator Chris Van Hollen [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=359.64s)]
*  Says that he is back because of demands that the Trump administration comply with court orders that Obreggo Garcia is due process [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=363.2s)]
*  And constitutional rights were being violated you two once served in the house together [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=371.15999999999997s)]
*  What do you make of his assessment because he's calling this a victory for the rule of law? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=374.79999999999995s)]
*  Well like the Supreme Court had its order he was returned to the United States [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  But now now it's time for our justice and that is who is this man for 20 years. He had a smuggling operation [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=383.24s)]
*  Including smuggling MS 13 gang members according to the indictment when he came back in I would argue Tim [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=391.04s)]
*  You're probably better off in El Salvador than than facing these kind of charges [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=397.68s)]
*  And this is precisely [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=402.28s)]
*  The case that that but Donald Trump ran on that got him a mandate from the American people [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=404.52s)]
*  They're tired of seeing this and what I'm amazed at and I saw it at our hearing with Secretary Noem [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=409.79999999999995s)]
*  Seeing the Democrats hold mr. Garcia as if he's some golden boy [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=415.88s)]
*  poster child that they all rally behind when he's in fact [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=420.55999999999995s)]
*  Related to MS 13 a trafficker [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=425.23999999999995s)]
*  He beats his wife. I mean it's hardly a model for the Democratic Party [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=428.11999999999995s)]
*  I think they're making a terrible mistake politically and we saw that play out in the last election [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=433.04s)]
*  Well a lot of allegations against him [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=438.08s)]
*  He now heads to trial at some point and we will watch that case to see what his ultimate disposition is by the law [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=439.96s)]
*  Good to see you. Thanks for coming. I'm always thanks, Ian. I went I'm Brian kill me. I want you to do me a favor [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqXx_cgmyzw&t=446.16s)]
