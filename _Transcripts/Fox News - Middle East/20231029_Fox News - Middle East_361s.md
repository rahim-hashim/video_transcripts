# Mark Levin: Biden blew this all up
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM)
*  Welcome back to America. We're here with Robert Greenway, former National Security Council [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=0.0s)]
*  senior director under President Trump. Robert Greenway, there's an ideology behind all this. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=4.8s)]
*  And I don't think the American people are aware, in my view, that they're being sold [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=12.68s)]
*  out by this president, his personnel, and the Democrat Party. Can you tell us about [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=16.02s)]
*  this ideology? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=21.48s)]
*  I think as best I can, the idea really is derived among those on the left-hand side [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=22.48s)]
*  of the political spectrum. And it's the approach to Palestine where this essentially grew out [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=28.22s)]
*  of. And the idea was that in order to get to equilibrium, we had to reduce Israel's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=33.1s)]
*  influence and its strength of its position and increase the Palestinian position relative [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=37.66s)]
*  to it. And the thought was that that would bring you to a negotiated settlement. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=41.98s)]
*  That same idea was translated to the Iranian problem. And so what essentially you see is [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=46.06s)]
*  in an effort to increase Iran's position and to decrease Israel and the rest of our partners [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=50.7s)]
*  and allies in the region relative to Iran so that you would get to equilibrium. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=55.6s)]
*  And the benefit theoretically of this is that the U.S. wouldn't have to be present. You [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=60.28s)]
*  would have a natural balance of power that would be sustainable, and we wouldn't have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=63.52s)]
*  to be involved. The idea is something that, in theory, I guess, would work in a graduate [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=67.44s)]
*  school environment, but it certainly doesn't work in the Middle East. And that is, I think, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=71.24000000000001s)]
*  what's behind both approaches to the Israel-Palestine question and to the Iran question in the Middle [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=74.80000000000001s)]
*  East. And we're seeing the consequences of this idea now borne out in real time, and [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=79.48s)]
*  it's not pretty. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=84.16s)]
*  Don't these people understand what terrorism means? It means they're not interested in [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=85.16s)]
*  negotiating unless it's for their purposes so they can attack again in the future. You're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=88.92s)]
*  not dealing withâ€”I mean, here's a piece by Obama, Thoughts on Israel and Gaza, which [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=94.92s)]
*  underscores your point. Here's another one by Ben Rhodes, the former deputy national [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=99.97999999999999s)]
*  security counsel under Obama, and really a disaster, saying the same thing. Here's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=104.84s)]
*  another one by Thomas Friedman, saying the same thing. Israel's about to make a terrible [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=111.36s)]
*  mistake. Israel's about to make a terrible mistake. So based on what you're saying, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=116.24s)]
*  that ideology is Israel must not obliterate Hamas. And when they talk about expanding [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=121.48s)]
*  the war in the Middle East, they're not talking about Israel needs to protect itself [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=128.76s)]
*  by not expanding the war in the Middle East, which I guess means don't defend yourself. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=133.72s)]
*  What they're saying is defend our ideology and defend our policies. And isn't that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=138.2s)]
*  another reason why they're soft on Iran, even in their rhetoric? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  It is. And there's a remarkable consistency on the domestic approach and on the foreign [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=147.88s)]
*  policy approach. It is a sympathy for the perpetrator and an antipathy for the victim. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=151.6s)]
*  So we're always trying to find out why the victim's responsible for a circumstance, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=157.16s)]
*  in this case Israel, and we're trying to support and find justification for the perpetrators, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=161.23999999999998s)]
*  in this case Hamas and really Iran, because it's a wholly owned franchise. And that applies [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=166.6s)]
*  in the United States in their approach to domestic policy and law enforcement and security [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=171.07999999999998s)]
*  on the southern border. And in this case, it applies to the national security and foreign [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=174.64s)]
*  policy in the Middle East. And you get the same results. It's horrific in both cases. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Now, you were intimately involved in the discussions that led to the Abraham Accords supporting [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=182.4s)]
*  President Trump. President Trump was a fantastic president. I mean, the Middle East was at [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  peace. There was peace breaking out between Israel and five or six of its Arab slash Muslim [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=193.92s)]
*  neighbors. Saudi Arabia, it looked like, was about to join the group, so forth. You had [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=199.6s)]
*  Iran in a box. You had the Palestinian terrorists in a box, Hezbollah in a box. And then the [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  Biden crowd comes in and blows it all up. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=213.72s)]
*  I think that's another reason why the likes of a Thomas Freeman and Ben Rhodes and the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=217.6s)]
*  others continuously trash Trump and his policies, but also continuously trash Benjamin Netanyahu, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=223.4s)]
*  dared to stand up to them, who dared to oppose their negotiations with Iran and so forth. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=232.72s)]
*  They hated Trump and they hate Netanyahu, no? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=239.28s)]
*  100%. It couldn't have been more obvious, the delay in calling him when he won the election, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=242.12s)]
*  the refusal to host him in the White House. They were reluctant to meet him even in New [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=247.0s)]
*  York during the General Assembly. And now, of course, we're in conflict. There's no question [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=250.56s)]
*  that on the left, there's an ideological predisposition against it. And unfortunately, they've manufactured [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  a fantasy that includes the Middle East. They've furnished it. They're living in it. And they'd [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  like everyone to join them. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=264.92s)]
*  But unfortunately, circumstances have really collapsed around them. And they're left to [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=266.16s)]
*  confront the reality that their policies haven't worked. Instead of reversing course, it seems [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=269.92s)]
*  like they're committed now to constrain Israel even further and prevent them from doing what's [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=274.32s)]
*  necessary to live securely. And at the same time, we have not stopped with providing resources [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=279.52s)]
*  to Tehran, which only translates into increased threat. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=284.44s)]
*  And the Iranian foreign minister is strolling around New York City, where Jewish students [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=287.52s)]
*  and Cooper Union can't do it to go to class. But here the Iranian foreign minister, the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=291.15999999999997s)]
*  party behind all of this that funds, trips, equips, trains, arms this particular terrorist [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=295.12s)]
*  group and a host of others is invited to the United States with open arms. It's absurd. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=300.68s)]
*  Two questions, very simple answers. Donald Trump was in fact the greatest president to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=305.68s)]
*  ever support Israel. Is that not true? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=311.84s)]
*  There's no question about it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump is also the greatest president to fight terrorism and terrorist regimes in the Middle [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=316.0s)]
*  East. Isn't that also true? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=322.36s)]
*  That's absolutely right. You can ask Baghdadi and you can ask Qasem Soleimani, but neither are [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=323.76s)]
*  available for comment. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=328.52s)]
*  And of course, he doesn't get any kind of international prizes. He doesn't get any positive [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=329.72s)]
*  recognition in our own media. Instead, they want to put him in prison for the rest of his life. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=334.24s)]
*  It is absolutely sickening. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=338.68s)]
*  Well, I want to thank you, sir, for your contribution to peace and truth. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=340.76s)]
*  God bless you, my friend. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E9GpMdwXbCM&t=345.6s)]
