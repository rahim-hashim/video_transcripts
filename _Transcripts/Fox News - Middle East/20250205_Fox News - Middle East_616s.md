# Hosts break down in laughter over media's reaction to Trump's Gaza plan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs)
*  So here we go. President Trump announcing a new plan, a plan for the U.S. to take over, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=0.0s)]
*  at least temporarily, the Gaza Strip, saying we'll turn it into the Riviera of the Middle [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=8.36s)]
*  East. Lucas Totlinson has more on what we know so far. Good morning to you, Lucas. Good [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  morning, guys. Standing alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=19.580000000000002s)]
*  foreign leader to visit the White House in President Trump's second term, Trump says [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=23.84s)]
*  the United States, as you mentioned, is going to go into Gaza and did not rule out U.S. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=27.6s)]
*  military involvement. The U.S. will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=32.28s)]
*  too. We'll own it and be responsible for dismantling all of the dangerous unexploded bombs and other [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=38.88s)]
*  weapons on the site. Mr. President, given what you've said about Gaza, did the U.S. send troops [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=45.44s)]
*  to help secure the security vacuum? As far as Gaza is concerned, we'll do what is necessary. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=50.68s)]
*  Now, Netanyahu appeared open to the idea. Saudi Arabia's foreign ministry says it rejects any [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=58.64s)]
*  attempts to displace Palestinians from their land. The French government also said it's strongly [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=63.84s)]
*  against any forced displacement of the Palestinians. Egypt, Jordan, other American allies in the region [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=68.52s)]
*  have previously rejected the idea of relocating the more than two million Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=73.84s)]
*  During the news conference, our own Peter Ducey asked Netanyahu the following question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=79.16s)]
*  We have heard Joe Biden and Donald Trump take credit for the hostage and ceasefire deal. Who [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=84.92s)]
*  do you think deserves more credit? I think President Trump added great force and powerful [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=92.28s)]
*  leadership to this effort. I appreciate it. He sent a very good emissary. He's helped it along. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=100.92s)]
*  So that was in the Oval Office before the news conference. Now, Trump says the U.S. will own [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=110.04s)]
*  Gaza and be responsible for dismantling all the unexploded ordnance. He said he wants to level [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=113.88s)]
*  Gaza and get rid of the destroyed buildings and rebuild it. Guys? You know, Nalukis is no doubt, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=118.76s)]
*  I mean, they're in a situation where they have to make a decision because Netanyahu says there's no [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=123.88s)]
*  way Hamas will stay in charge. Michael Waltz says the Trump administration position is there's no [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=128.52s)]
*  way Hamas stays in charge. But if you've seen the hostage takeover, they're still the number one [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  presence in the area. They're the ones still with the guns. That's right. And we saw those Hamas [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  soldiers fully kitted out with brand new uniforms, brandishing weapons, Hamas still a force there in [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  Gaza. Also, let's just think, just a few days ago when Trump was talking about leveling tariffs on [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=149.24s)]
*  Mexico and Canada, you saw a big about face. Perhaps this announcement will get the attention [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=154.68s)]
*  of other allies in the Middle East, guys. Indeed. All right. Lucas, thank you very much for the live [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=159.0s)]
*  report from D.C. So it was such a jaw dropper last night. The cover of the New York Post is, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=164.12s)]
*  we'll take over Gaza. And you've got to wonder where this idea came from. I know Jared Kushner [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  had told the president a year or two ago, he said Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=175.96s)]
*  suggested the Israelis move the people out and then clean it up. Donald Trump is a developer. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=182.12s)]
*  He sees the potential. But then again, we're talking about land that people have fought over for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=187.24s)]
*  decades. And it would involve moving the Palestinians out. It looks like Trump and Netanyahu [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=192.04000000000002s)]
*  discussed it. But they didn't really talk to the other side because as Lucas detailed some of the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=197.08s)]
*  other sides involved like Hamas has said no, the no so far that I just was reading about in the [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=201.88s)]
*  times of Israel, Egypt is a no Hamas is a no Saudi Arabia is a no and China is a no. And there's an [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=208.28s)]
*  op-ed in the times of Israel right now that says the Gaza plan won't happen but could shake up the [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=215.88s)]
*  region because new ideas are needed. This might spark more viable solutions. And that's what [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=221.08s)]
*  Donald Trump said yesterday. We need new ideas. Well, I think it's going to force the Muslim world [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=225.72s)]
*  to find a solution as well. I think it's going to give the president a lot of leverage. Something [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=231.16s)]
*  has to give. And I don't know if this is the solution. But I tweeted out last night, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=235.56s)]
*  let me just sleep on this. Let me just sleep on this. I think so often when the president puts a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=240.28s)]
*  radical idea out there to change the conversation around the issue, people just freak out. And [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=245.0s)]
*  that's what the media did last night. If America looked like Gaza, I would consider leaving if, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=251.0s)]
*  you know, if I had to live in the. I mean, every time we show video of it, I'm like, I cannot [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=258.52s)]
*  believe people live like this because we're so blessed and fortunate. It's like the wildfires, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=264.68s)]
*  but eventually people want to go back. And that's the problem. And that's a little different [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=269.96s)]
*  because it's so gorgeous in California. You do have to risk the wildfire, especially if you're [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=274.04s)]
*  not going to get insurance for it. But when you look at the video of Gaza, that is no place I [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=277.8s)]
*  would ever want to go or visit. And he says he's not specifying where this new land for Gazans [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=281.48s)]
*  might be. But he said, you know, why not? I mean, you don't have to leave, I guess, if you don't [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=286.6s)]
*  want to. But if you have the opportunity for economic development and supplied unlimited [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=291.0s)]
*  number of jobs and housing and a good, fresh, beautiful piece of land, like he calls it, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=295.88s)]
*  why wouldn't you consider it? Why wouldn't they say thanks for doing this? Netanyahu said one [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=300.52s)]
*  thing that I thought was interesting. He said, you say things others refuse to say talking about [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=304.52s)]
*  Donald Trump. And after the jaws drop, people scratch their heads and they say, you know, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=308.68s)]
*  he's right. Just doing a little bit of history. You had the Palestinians in Jordan and they said [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=314.6s)]
*  they created havoc. They threw him out. They were in Lebanon. They were creating havoc. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=320.04s)]
*  They tossed him out. They were in Egypt in the 1920s. And they basically gave birth to what we [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=324.28000000000003s)]
*  now know as Al Qaeda. That's Hamas is a division of that. They got tossed out. So they became [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=330.52000000000004s)]
*  Israel's problem. And we know about the Balfour agreement. So now they had in the Oslo situation, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=336.6s)]
*  they said, what if we gave you Gaza and West Bank? And Clinton said, we build a bridge, both of them. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=342.04s)]
*  That'll be your state. Yair Sarif had essentially said, yeah, if I do that, they'll kill me because [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=347.32s)]
*  we basically want all of Israel. So if you want all of Israel and you say there's going to be [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=352.04s)]
*  many more October 7th and you rocket to Israel every single day, Israel just had 1,100 innocent [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=356.68s)]
*  people, including babies killed in the most horrific way imaginable. Why would you say, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=363.48s)]
*  let's just call it a ceasefire, go back because we're going to be on this couch again, 18 months [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=368.2s)]
*  later and talk about another devastating attack. They promised they would do it again. We have to [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=372.44s)]
*  revisit all of this, but we are so done. It is really two areas, Palestinians and Iran, everybody [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=376.6s)]
*  else. And we're going to talk to Qatari, foreign minister, special advisor shortly. Everybody else [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=384.84000000000003s)]
*  is on the page. And you can't say it's anti-Muslim. President Trump says, listen, I love the Middle [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=390.28000000000003s)]
*  East. I'm going to be going to Saudi Arabia. I'm going to visit all these countries. It's not [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  anti-Palestinian. It's anti-terrorists. The rocketing every day has to stop. But the Democrats don't seem [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=398.68s)]
*  to understand that. Listen. He's got his eye on some real estate deal because he thinks that the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=405.24s)]
*  coastline of Gaza is going to be great for some new hotel. It's preposterous and it's illegal by [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=410.36s)]
*  any understanding of international law. This is not anything of a plan. This is a complete [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=415.96000000000004s)]
*  American imperialism at its roots, at its core. Donald Trump suggesting that this land in the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=421.48s)]
*  Middle East would be better occupied and overseen by America. I just don't think we can really begin [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=429.0s)]
*  to even comprehend what we're hearing two weeks in from this administration. Clearly America is now, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=435.0s)]
*  you know, expressing clearly that they want to occupy permanently, probably, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=440.92s)]
*  Gaza. They want the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians. So one of the things we're not saying is [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=446.52s)]
*  ethnic cleansing. That's not what he's saying. And of course, the Palestinians, if you interview them, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=451.8s)]
*  which many of these left organizations have, they're going to say, we don't want to leave. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=456.28s)]
*  But they have to say that they don't have any other options. They're landlocked. No one wants [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=460.76s)]
*  to take them right now unless President Trump comes up with a deal. And they're scared of Hamas. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=465.08s)]
*  Well, and so far they say they're not going to leave. And that's the problem right there. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=469.48s)]
*  My question is, how much is it going to cost? I mean, we've got Elon Musk going through the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=474.52s)]
*  federal government right now. The Arab world is going to pay for it, he said. Yeah. Well, [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  let's see. The Arab world, Saudi Arabia said this morning, no ties with Israel without the creation [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=481.4s)]
*  of a Palestinian state. So they are a firm no on the idea. Are there tariffs in the future? [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=486.68s)]
*  Right. Although there are people who are already talking about how it would be a great idea, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=490.44s)]
*  a lot of people. David Friedman, the ambassador for Israel during the Trump years, he suggested, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=496.52s)]
*  so will we call it Mara Gaza or Gaza Lago? And then Marco Rubio said the United States is ready [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=503.32s)]
*  to make Gaza beautiful again. Well, we tried to build a platform, and that didn't work [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=510.92s)]
*  under the last administration to get aid in. Hamas took it. They have a ton of money. They built [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=515.08s)]
*  tunnels. They were supposed to build cities. We gave them a ton of aid. Hamas keeps it. And then [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=521.0s)]
*  when it was time for them to rebuild and get support, they bought guns and weapons. The people, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=527.96s)]
*  the Palestinian people have no choice of being held hostage by those people who aren't on like [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=537.0s)]
*  mine with Hamas. They have no choice. These guys got the guns. They will torture your family. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=541.48s)]
*  If you come out and say you caused all this unrest. So they're almost, they're almost say, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=546.12s)]
*  they almost should want to slip us a note saying, get me out of this. Well, and if we don't go ahead, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=551.96s)]
*  sorry, you go ahead. No, I was just going to say, and if we don't get control of this, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=558.12s)]
*  this is going to be more terror. And that means the U.S. troops are going to eventually have to [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  get involved. And so if you don't want intervention, then let's put an end to this in some way. I don't [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=567.08s)]
*  know if this is the idea, but I'm willing to have the conversation. You can't tell me when you look [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLk0mkPToMs&t=572.76s)]
