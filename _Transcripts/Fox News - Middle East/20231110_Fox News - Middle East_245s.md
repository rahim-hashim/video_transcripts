# Lindsey Graham on Biden's Israel policy: 'Hamas saw weakness and acted'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU)
*  Here with reaction, South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=0.0s)]
*  is with us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=2.54s)]
*  Senator, welcome to the program. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=3.38s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=4.2s)]
*  Thank you, yeah, I wish I was there. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=5.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=7.84s)]
*  You know, Joe Biden, even today, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=9.24s)]
*  they're pushing Israel to hit the pause button. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=11.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=14.64s)]
*  And I'm trying to understand why they would do that. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=15.84s)]
*  Because when you hit the pause button, they get to rearm. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=18.52s)]
*  When you hit the pause button, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=20.88s)]
*  they get to resupply whatever they need. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=22.0s)]
*  When you hit the pause button, they get to re-strategize. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=24.740000000000002s)]
*  Shouldn't they be out there winning the war [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=28.0s)]
*  that they didn't start, that they didn't want, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=30.16s)]
*  that they now have to finish? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=33.08s)]
*  I miss Trump. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=35.32s)]
*  How many of you believe if Trump were president, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=36.96s)]
*  none of this would be happening? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=38.92s)]
*  Well, let me ask, do you believe this wouldn't happen? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=40.72s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=44.84s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=45.68s)]
*  Here's what I believe. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  If we were president tomorrow, it would stop tomorrow. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  But let's talk about Hillary Clinton. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=50.68s)]
*  Old, bitter and defeated is no way to go through life. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=52.72s)]
*  So I support President Trump. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=56.56s)]
*  It's offensive to me to suggest [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=59.64s)]
*  I'm supporting Adolf Hitler [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  because she disagrees with the way he does business. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=63.84s)]
*  Here's what President Trump did. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=66.68s)]
*  He recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=68.44s)]
*  He recognized Golan Heights as part of Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=72.64s)]
*  He got six Arab nations to recognize Israel [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=75.68s)]
*  as a legitimate, one and only Jewish state. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=79.56s)]
*  That's not Adolf Hitler. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  That's the strongest supporter of Israel [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=84.76s)]
*  in modern American history. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=87.2s)]
*  Donald Trump did more for Israel than any single president. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=89.60000000000001s)]
*  On Biden's watch, more Jews have been killed [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  since the Holocaust. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=97.92s)]
*  Hamas saw weakness, they acted. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=99.76s)]
*  And I'll tell you this, if one American is killed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  by Shiite militia supported by Iran, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  if one of our soldiers is killed in Iraq and Syria, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=108.84s)]
*  we should blow the Iranian oil refineries to smithereens. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=112.56s)]
*  We should destroy their ability to fund terrorism. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=117.96s)]
*  Let Iran know tonight, you kill an American, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=121.52s)]
*  we're coming after you. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=124.16s)]
*  Let me ask you, Senator, under Barack Obama and Joe Biden, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=125.8s)]
*  they made this Iranian deal, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=132.35999999999999s)]
*  which I thought was nuts, giving them billions of dollars. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=133.64s)]
*  Under Joe Biden, Iran has now been able to sell oil. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=135.84s)]
*  It's estimated they made between 80 and $100 billion. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=139.51999999999998s)]
*  Then the $6 billion in payment [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=143.39999999999998s)]
*  as a ransom for five hostages. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=146.88s)]
*  What is it about Joe Biden and Barack Obama and Democrats [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=149.35999999999999s)]
*  that think that they can negotiate [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=153.32s)]
*  with the number one state sponsor of terror? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=155.2s)]
*  I'm not understanding it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=158.44s)]
*  Well, when Obama's president, Putin invades Ukraine, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  When Trump's president, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=166.64s)]
*  everybody runs and hides in the corner. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=167.96s)]
*  When Biden's president, Putin invades Ukraine again. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=170.84s)]
*  When Biden's president, Hamas kills more Jews [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=174.72s)]
*  than any time since the Holocaust. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=177.96s)]
*  Afghanistan started this. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=180.84s)]
*  When he left Afghanistan, a shameful act, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=183.0s)]
*  that set in motion everything we're talking about. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  This is the same administration [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=189.36s)]
*  that is having more illegal immigrants [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=191.72s)]
*  cross our border illegally than all presidents combined. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=193.88s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing on the border. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=198.64000000000001s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing when it comes to bad guys. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=200.88s)]
*  If you had Donald Trump as president, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=203.68s)]
*  we would secure the border tomorrow. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=205.68s)]
*  People would listen to him in Mexico and other places [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=207.96s)]
*  because they're afraid of him. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=211.48000000000002s)]
*  If he were president of the United States, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=212.76s)]
*  this stuff with Iran would end. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=214.84s)]
*  The only thing that works with bad guys is to be strong. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=216.84s)]
*  Our border is broken. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=219.88s)]
*  Our policies don't work. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=221.2s)]
*  It's a matter of time to a bunch of Americans get killed. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=222.96s)]
*  I will not vote for one dime for any country, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=225.76000000000002s)]
*  including Israel, until we first secure our own border. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JmDVCYwrHKU&t=228.6s)]
