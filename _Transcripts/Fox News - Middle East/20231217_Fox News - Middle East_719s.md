# Dershowitz calls for 'total, unconditional surrender' of Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ)
*  Music [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and this is Life, Liberty and Levin. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  We have two great guests this evening, Alan Dershowitz and David Schoen, experts on the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=17.32s)]
*  Constitution and men who know an awful lot about American history and what's going on [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=22.12s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=27.68s)]
*  Two great guests. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=28.68s)]
*  Before we get to them, I'm deeply concerned about how this administration is publicly [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=29.68s)]
*  turning on the state of Israel. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=35.16s)]
*  Joe Biden said the other day that the Israelis are indiscriminately bombing Gaza. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=38.88s)]
*  That is a flat out lie. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=43.68s)]
*  They have tens of thousands of infantry there and that's not what they're doing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=44.96s)]
*  He says that the international community is turning on the Jews. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=48.8s)]
*  I guess he missed the vote in the UN General Assembly the other day. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=51.6s)]
*  The international community has always been against Israel and the Jews. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=55.3s)]
*  He's withholding M16s from Israel that Israel wants to purchase to in part arm the Jews [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=59.64s)]
*  who are in Judea and Samaria because Hamas and other terrorist operations are now implanted [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=66.24s)]
*  there. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=72.24s)]
*  In fact, they seem to be targeting the Jews in Judea and Samaria on visa challenges and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=73.24s)]
*  everything else. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=78.4s)]
*  They don't have any evidence. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=79.4s)]
*  I've looked online. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=80.4s)]
*  I've dug very hard into this issue. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=81.4s)]
*  They keep calling for ceasefires, temporary, permanent, and now they say, okay, let them [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=86.44s)]
*  go at it for a while. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=91.8s)]
*  And yet we're arming the Iranians. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=95.16s)]
*  All the major sanctions that were placed on the Iranians have been waived from day one. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=97.28s)]
*  So Iran has been armed up. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=102.12s)]
*  It's using its money and its weapons to get to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=105.3s)]
*  the Houthis, and Hamas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=109.32s)]
*  Why are they doing that? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=111.72s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=113.36s)]
*  They are funding Hamas directly by giving money to UNRWA that Donald Trump cut off. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=114.4s)]
*  Now UNRWA is giving millions and millions of dollars, and UNRWA is a cesspool. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  We're arming the PLO directly. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=126.08000000000001s)]
*  Donald Trump cut that off in violation of the Teller Force Act. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=127.56s)]
*  And what does that say? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=131.28s)]
*  You don't get any American money if you don't stop killing Israeli Jews and other people [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=132.64000000000001s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=136.24s)]
*  Well, and there's no new sanctions on Iran. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=137.6s)]
*  There's no serious military response to the attack on American soldiers and bases that [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=141.84s)]
*  are in that part of the world. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=149.16s)]
*  And here at home, there appears to be no federal urgency at the Department of Justice, the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=151.28s)]
*  Civil Rights Division at Education, or the Department of Homeland Security to protect [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=156.12s)]
*  Jewish students on college campuses, to daily beat the drums about what's taking place in [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=161.48000000000002s)]
*  this country. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=167.8s)]
*  Every time they mention, when they do mention anti-Semitism, they feel the need to mention [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=169.2s)]
*  Islamophobia. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  There is no Islamophobia in America, as I've said before. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=176.11999999999998s)]
*  Islamophobia is in the Middle East, where Muslims are slaughtering Muslims. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=178.95999999999998s)]
*  That's not going on in this country. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=182.79999999999998s)]
*  And Muslims are not running to their dorm rooms and locking themselves in, or the lunch [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=184.6s)]
*  rooms or the attics. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=189.16s)]
*  They're not afraid to go to class and so forth and so on. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=190.95999999999998s)]
*  And I could go on and on and on. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=193.79999999999998s)]
*  But why should I? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  I want to have a guest like Alan Dershowitz here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of all this? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=199.76s)]
*  Well, you're 100 percent right. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=200.92s)]
*  This is an attack against the world. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=203.48s)]
*  We just learned that now Hamas is expanding its scope, and it wants to attack Jewish entities [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=208.14s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=215.16s)]
*  It's coming to a theater near you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=216.2s)]
*  If Hamas is not stopped in the Middle East, it will spread all over the world. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=218.6s)]
*  It will start with Jewish institutions, as it often does, but it will spread to Christian [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=224.76s)]
*  institutions. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=230.72s)]
*  It will spread to other institutions. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=231.84s)]
*  And we'll be in a global war with Hamas, as we were with ISIS and al-Qaeda. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=234.16s)]
*  And we must do to Hamas what the American troops under Roosevelt and under Churchill [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=240.12s)]
*  did to Japan and Germany. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=246.68s)]
*  Total unconditional surrender, total war, total defeat. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=249.36s)]
*  We must wipe out Hamas. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=253.92s)]
*  And people say you can't wipe out an ideology. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=255.48s)]
*  Nonsense. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=258.32s)]
*  We wiped out Nazism, except that it's coming back at some university campuses 75 years [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=259.32s)]
*  later. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=265.59999999999997s)]
*  But we wiped it out in the follow-up to the Second World War, after we killed all the [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=266.59999999999997s)]
*  Nazis and killed and imprisoned and tried all the Japanese imperialists. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=271.28s)]
*  So you can wipe out an ideology if you wipe out the leaders. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=276.64s)]
*  And that's what Israel, with the help of the United States, has to do. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=280.82s)]
*  In terms of indiscriminate bombing, did you see the other day that nine Israeli soldiers [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=284.7s)]
*  and one commander were killed precisely because they didn't use bombing? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=292.09999999999997s)]
*  They could have bombed the area they were in, but they didn't want to kill civilians. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=297.61999999999995s)]
*  So they sent young men and women, 19-, 20-year-old IDF soldiers, and they had an ambush. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=302.17999999999995s)]
*  And they were all killed. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=308.98s)]
*  And they were killed precisely because they're not using indiscriminate bombing. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  They're being very precise. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=314.94s)]
*  Never in the history of warfare has any country taken more efforts and sacrificed more to [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=316.94s)]
*  avoid killing civilians on the other side. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=323.14000000000004s)]
*  That's the truth. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=326.02000000000004s)]
*  It is the truth. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=327.02000000000004s)]
*  And I want to speak another truth, Professor Dershowitz, if I'd like your opinion. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=328.02000000000004s)]
*  We keep hearing about the Palestinian civilians, that they don't want any of this. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  There's two surveys done in the last three and a half weeks. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=338.06s)]
*  One is by the Arab World for Research and Development. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=342.18s)]
*  That doesn't sound like an American Jewish front group to me, and it's not. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=344.7s)]
*  And what did they write? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=349.41999999999996s)]
*  Take it as a whole, the results indicate that an overwhelming percent of Palestinians support [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=350.41999999999996s)]
*  the October 7 massacre, 75%. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=354.96s)]
*  Reject coexistence with Israel, 86%. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=358.9s)]
*  Are committed to the restoration of historical Palestine, which means the elimination of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=362.46s)]
*  Israel, as a final solution, 71%. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=366.54s)]
*  They support the creation of a Palestinian state from the river to the sea, the annihilation [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=370.76000000000005s)]
*  of Israel, 75% as the end of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=374.90000000000003s)]
*  These are Palestinians who were surveyed in Gaza and Judea and Samaria. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=380.14000000000004s)]
*  They said the Palestinian positive perception of terror organizations remains high despite [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=384.82000000000005s)]
*  the role in carrying out the massacre and disastrous results. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=390.16s)]
*  76% believe that Hamas plays a somewhat positive role, 84% believe that the Palestinian Islamic [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=393.94s)]
*  Jihad plays a somewhat positive role, 80% believe that Fatah's terror wing, the al-Aqsa [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=400.64s)]
*  Martyrs Brigade plays a somewhat positive role, and 88.6% believe that Hamas' armed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=407.78000000000003s)]
*  wing, the al-Qassam Brigade plays a somewhat positive function. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=415.02s)]
*  So why do the media keep telling us there's this tremendous distinction, this great distance [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=419.9s)]
*  between Hamas and other terrorist groups and the people who elect them and support them? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=425.9s)]
*  Why do they keep telling us that? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=430.78s)]
*  Well, it's a lie. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=432.02s)]
*  We know that not only do the vast majority of people in Gaza and on the West Bank support [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=433.38s)]
*  the Hamas atrocities, in Gaza many of them helped it. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=439.18s)]
*  Remember when Hamas broke through the fence and started killing Israelis, Gazan civilians [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=444.58s)]
*  followed them. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=450.09999999999997s)]
*  They participated in the rapes, the beheadings, the murders. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=451.36s)]
*  Gazan civilians helped them by having tunnels under their homes, by having command centers, [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=455.06s)]
*  by having rockets being fired from schools and from mosques. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=463.7s)]
*  So look, we all have to be sympathetic to the babies and the children, who are used [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=467.9s)]
*  as human shields, by the way, by Hamas. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=472.5s)]
*  And every single one of these babies who were killed is the responsibility of Hamas. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=474.06s)]
*  But I'm far less sympathetic to the adults who aggressively support Hamas. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=478.74s)]
*  You know, if they were in America, they'd be tried for crimes because you can't, under [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=484.78000000000003s)]
*  American law, provide material support for a terrorist group. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=488.26000000000005s)]
*  And these Gazans are providing material support for Hamas, which is a terrorist group. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=492.58000000000004s)]
*  And as I say, it's coming to America. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=498.20000000000005s)]
*  It's coming to Europe. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=500.04s)]
*  Hamas is not going to stop. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=501.65999999999997s)]
*  If it prevails in the Middle East, it's going to continue just the way Al-Qaeda and other [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=503.26s)]
*  groups have continued. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=509.02s)]
*  So we have to stop it in the interests of America. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=510.02s)]
*  And this isn't a one-off survey. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=513.06s)]
*  A couple of days ago, a survey was done by a Palestinian survey operation and is pointed [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=514.66s)]
*  out at AP News. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=521.76s)]
*  A wartime opinion poll among Palestinians published last Wednesday shows a rise in support [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=523.34s)]
*  for Hamas. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=528.94s)]
*  The findings by a Palestinian pollster signal more difficulties ahead for the Biden administration. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=529.94s)]
*  Post-war vision. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  Who gives a damn about the post-war vision of the Biden administration? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=536.0600000000001s)]
*  The Israelis are fighting for their survival. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=540.9000000000001s)]
*  They are surrounded by Hamas, the PLO, Hezbollah, the Houthis, Iran. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=543.46s)]
*  And AP writes about it's a political problem for Joe Biden. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=549.86s)]
*  Aren't you sick and tired of reading the politicization of this? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=553.5s)]
*  This is reality, is it not? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=557.1s)]
*  It is. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=558.9000000000001s)]
*  Israel should be a bipartisan issue. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=560.06s)]
*  All sides should support Israel without regard to what parties they belong to. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=561.8199999999999s)]
*  And there's been a rise in popularity of Hamas in the United States as well. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=566.9399999999999s)]
*  On October 8, the day after these horrors that occurred on September 7, students at [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=571.42s)]
*  Harvard supported Hamas. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=577.1s)]
*  The National Lawyers Guild supported Hamas. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=578.98s)]
*  I document all of this. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=581.6999999999999s)]
*  I wrote a book right after the events at question. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=583.18s)]
*  I started writing it on October 7, the war against the Jews. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=585.98s)]
*  And in it, I document how increased support for Hamas occurred among the hard left. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=589.3800000000001s)]
*  The hard left has become the enemy of justice, of decency, of academia. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=596.1s)]
*  And we have to continue our fight not only against Hamas, but against Hamas supporters [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=602.94s)]
*  in the United States that can become easily a fifth column. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=608.2600000000001s)]
*  Remember in the 1970s when the weathermen started blowing up universities, trying to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=612.02s)]
*  blow up Fort Dix. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=618.3000000000001s)]
*  That's going to happen here. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=620.3000000000001s)]
*  We have a fifth column of hard left Hamas supporters, many of them Muslim, many of them [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=622.1s)]
*  not Muslim, many of them hard left kids, our friends' children are marching with Hamas. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=627.5s)]
*  And that's why it's so dangerous to Americans and to the world and why we have to fight [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=633.78s)]
*  back. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=638.94s)]
*  Logically, we have a combination on our college campuses and beyond of an Islamist and a [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=640.9000000000001s)]
*  Marxist ideology because they both support the same thing, the destruction of the Enlightenment, [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=645.5s)]
*  the destruction of Western culture. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=650.62s)]
*  And they are genocidal. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=653.46s)]
*  Your book, The War Against the Jews, How to End Hamas Barbarism, let me tell you what's [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=654.7s)]
*  fascinating about your book among other things. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=659.1800000000001s)]
*  How you wrote it as quickly as you did, how you got it published as quickly as you did. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=661.74s)]
*  And it's not only prescient, it's up to date on everything that's going on in this [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=665.94s)]
*  country, which is why I wanted to have you on. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=670.1s)]
*  You can get this on Amazon.com, any major bookstore. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=672.1s)]
*  And when we come back, Alan Dershowitz, I want to talk more about what's going on here [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=676.46s)]
*  domestically because last week there was a vote in the House of Representatives, led [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=680.34s)]
*  by the Republicans yet again, saying we need to make the point that we urge MIT and Harvard [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=686.7s)]
*  to fire their presidents or for them to resign after this disastrous hearing we had in the [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=695.42s)]
*  House of Representatives. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=700.4599999999999s)]
*  One hundred nine Democrats voted no. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=702.4599999999999s)]
*  I want to pursue that with you when we return. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B25JJQuZwOQ&t=704.9s)]
