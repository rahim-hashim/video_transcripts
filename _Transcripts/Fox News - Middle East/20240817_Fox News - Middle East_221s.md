# Kamala Harris has ‘blood on her hands’: Marine veteran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc)
*  You got it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been three years since the desperate scene [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=1.52s)]
*  in Afghanistan amid the Biden administration's [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=3.6s)]
*  botched withdrawal. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=5.72s)]
*  And according to Kamala Harris, well, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=7.4s)]
*  she played a key role in it. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=9.16s)]
*  President Biden always said that he [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  wants you to be the last person in the room, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  particularly for big decisions, just as he was for President [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=16.32s)]
*  Obama. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=19.56s)]
*  He just made a really big decision. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=20.06s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=21.8s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=22.56s)]
*  Were you the last person in the room? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=23.6s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=25.04s)]
*  And you feel comfortable? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=26.6s)]
*  I do. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=27.72s)]
*  She feels comfortable. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=28.64s)]
*  Our next guest helped lead rescue missions there, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=30.48s)]
*  and he's the author of a new book, A Mission [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=32.4s)]
*  Without Borders, US Marine Corps veteran Chad Robichaud. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=34.44s)]
*  Chad, thanks for being here. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=37.4s)]
*  When you hear her say, I was the last person in the room, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=39.08s)]
*  I feel comfortable with it, you say what? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=42.68s)]
*  I mean, I say she's responsible. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=46.28s)]
*  She has blood on her hands. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=47.68s)]
*  Look, we left Americans there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  We left our allies there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=51.0s)]
*  We left 20 million Afghan women and little girls [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=52.0s)]
*  to be sexually enslaved. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=54.6s)]
*  We left four-figure national security, $80 billion [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=55.64s)]
*  in equipment, and people like myself and our team, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=58.44s)]
*  we had to go and rescue Americans. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  We had to go and rescue our allies, 17,000 of them, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=63.32s)]
*  while our administration abandoned these people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=66.6s)]
*  And right now, we're still sending them, by the way. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=70.16s)]
*  I don't know if your audience knows this, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=72.64s)]
*  but $87 million a week, half of which [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=74.28s)]
*  is going in cash to people in the top 10 terrorist [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=76.8s)]
*  most wanted list, to people who are sanctioned by the United [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=79.12s)]
*  States. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  All that money is going to people who are sanctioned [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=82.4s)]
*  by the United States government. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=83.72s)]
*  It's illegal. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=84.96s)]
*  It's unethical, and it's against our own interest [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=85.88s)]
*  in national security. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=88.24s)]
*  This money's being used to fund terrorism, our taxpayer dollars. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=89.16s)]
*  Yeah, we've spent $3 billion still in Afghanistan [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=92.91999999999999s)]
*  into the hands of the Taliban since what [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  happened three years ago. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=98.67999999999999s)]
*  And we saw it on display in that military parade they put on. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  What's been the fallout from what happened three years ago? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=104.6s)]
*  What's the implication been of this failure? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=109.24s)]
*  How is the world looking at America now, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=111.72s)]
*  three years after Afghanistan? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=113.91999999999999s)]
*  The fallout is we left. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=117.0s)]
*  We had about four al-Qaeda training camps there. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=118.92s)]
*  Now there's 52. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=122.08s)]
*  And they're being funded by our taxpayer dollars. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=123.2s)]
*  There's a Hamas, I mean, a fund for a mortar fund, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=125.36s)]
*  a mortar fund for those Taliban fighters [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=131.96s)]
*  that we killed over 20 years. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=134.0s)]
*  $1,000 a month, a house for the fighters that we killed, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=135.68s)]
*  the terrorists we killed. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=139.56s)]
*  The place is just a hotbed for terrorism. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=140.72s)]
*  The diplomats from Iran were at that parade. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=142.8s)]
*  Diplomats from China were at that parade. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=145.72s)]
*  They occupy the most strategic place [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=147.24s)]
*  on the globe between Iraq, Iran, Russia, and China. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  And all of the world's enemies were watching, including Putin. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=150.96s)]
*  And the reason that Putin's crossed that border [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=153.72s)]
*  in eastern Ukraine was because of the weakness [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=156.44s)]
*  that he saw in Afghanistan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  He pushed 100,000 troops across. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=160.96s)]
*  And what did President Biden do? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=162.44s)]
*  The same thing he did in Afghanistan. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=163.44s)]
*  He removed our troops. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=165.20000000000002s)]
*  He closed our embassy and consulate. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=166.36s)]
*  NATO followed and allowed Putin to start this war [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=167.96s)]
*  where a million people have died now. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=170.52s)]
*  And more US taxpayer dollars are getting funded in. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=172.24s)]
*  But hundreds of billions now. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=175.32s)]
*  And Harris was a part of all of it. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=177.56s)]
*  She was right there for all of it, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=178.76s)]
*  signing off on it as well. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=181.2s)]
*  Real quick, Chad, before we go, what would you ask her? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=182.76s)]
*  If you could ask her one question, you know, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=185.0s)]
*  she's not taking any interviews these days. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=186.68s)]
*  What would you ask her? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=188.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=189.56s)]
*  Why is her interest not in the best interest of America, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=191.84s)]
*  the American people, or national security? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=194.64s)]
*  Why is her interest in the funding terrorism, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=196.68s)]
*  including Iran, the Taliban, al-Qaeda? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=199.84s)]
*  Why would she betray the American people that way? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  That's a great question. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=206.0s)]
*  Hopefully someone picks it up. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=206.84s)]
*  Chad, thank you for your service [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=207.95999999999998s)]
*  and your time this morning. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dh9sz_dAtc&t=209.4s)]
