# This is a 'lose-lose proposition' for the Iranian regime, says exiled crown prince
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88)
*  Iran's tyrants don't care about your future, but you do. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=0.0s)]
*  When Iran is finally free, and that moment will come a lot sooner than people think, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=7.04s)]
*  everything will be different. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=12.52s)]
*  Our two ancient peoples, the Jewish people and the Persian people, will finally be at [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=14.4s)]
*  peace. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=19.52s)]
*  Our two countries, Israel and Iran, will be at peace. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=20.52s)]
*  And that's Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu with a direct message to the people [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=26.36s)]
*  of Iran as the authoritarian regime continues its terrorist campaign against the Jewish [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=30.72s)]
*  state and even its own citizens who dare speak out against the supreme leader, Ayatollah [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=35.76s)]
*  Komeini. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=41.0s)]
*  Tomorrow, Israel will mark one year since the deadly terrorist attacks of October 7th, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=42.0s)]
*  in which 1,200 people were murdered by Hamas when the Iranian-backed terrorist proxy invaded [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=47.14s)]
*  southern Israel from the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  Joining me now in this Sunday Morning Futures exclusive is His Royal Highness the exiled [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=55.68s)]
*  Crown Prince of Iran Reza Pahlavi. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  Your Highness, thank you very much for being here. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  We so appreciate it. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=64.62s)]
*  Characterize where we are in this fight. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=66.2s)]
*  Maria, I think it's important for the whole world to realize that the first victim of [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=69.28s)]
*  this whole situation were the people of Iran with a regime that is at war with them, let [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=76.32s)]
*  alone the rest of the region and perhaps beyond that. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=82.08s)]
*  The policy of appeasement and laissez-faire has led us to where we are today. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=85.92s)]
*  We could have a different situation in the Middle East without this regime. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=91.48s)]
*  But as long as this regime is going to be there, none of the threats and the consequences [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=95.17999999999999s)]
*  of its behavior will be eliminated. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=99.82s)]
*  And sadly, as you referred to October 7th and that attack, this clearly shows, especially [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=102.96s)]
*  when Ayatollah Khamenei actually defends that act and justifies it, where exactly they [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=108.82s)]
*  stand as opposed to the Iranian people who have clearly demonstrated that this regime [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=114.94s)]
*  has nothing to do with their aspirations. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=120.86s)]
*  And I'm glad that leaders such as Prime Minister Netanyahu does make that distinction. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=123.33999999999999s)]
*  And it has to be right now a distinction that I hope many leaders around the world will [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=128.7s)]
*  make between the people of Iran and this regime. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=133.66s)]
*  So is there a message that you want to convey to the people of Iran versus the regime, which [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=137.1s)]
*  obviously is behind this death and destruction? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=142.7s)]
*  I think the Iranian people will be the first one to tell all of us that they realize that [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=146.62s)]
*  if they are in a position to show the whole world and our region, our neighbors, whether [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=151.14s)]
*  they're Arabs or Jews or Muslims or Christians or whatever faith they represent, that we [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=157.7s)]
*  want peace with them. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=162.5s)]
*  We want to be able to have cordial relations with them. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=163.7s)]
*  We want to build a better future for all of us in that region that we can all collectively [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=166.42s)]
*  benefit from. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=171.29999999999998s)]
*  And what stands between us, Iranian people and the rest of the world and our neighbors, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=172.7s)]
*  is this regime. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=177.34s)]
*  And as long as this regime is there, our primary duty is to do our part in getting rid of it. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=178.57999999999998s)]
*  But we will hope that the world this time stands with us as opposed to continue trying [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=183.62s)]
*  to negotiate deals with a regime that cannot be trusted, that has proven time and again [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=188.5s)]
*  that its only objective is to use every resource of my country to export its ideology at the [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=194.18s)]
*  expense of the Iranian people themselves. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=200.46s)]
*  You make such an important point here, and I want to go back to it, and that is how it [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=202.86s)]
*  is possible that Iran was able to generate so many billions of dollars to support these [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=207.10000000000002s)]
*  terrorist proxies. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=212.78s)]
*  The administration, Conala Harris and Joe Biden, keep saying, oh no, no, no, we never [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=214.10000000000002s)]
*  change the sanctions. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=220.3s)]
*  The sanctions have been on Iran, but were they actually enforced? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=221.58s)]
*  They were not, because the hundred plus billion dollars that the regime had access to a couple [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  years ago, closing into what happened and ultimately led to empowering it to support [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=232.94s)]
*  its proxies, including Hezbollah and Hamas of course, didn't come from nowhere. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=239.62s)]
*  If those old sanctions were imposed, that would be a hundred billion less for the regime [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=244.58s)]
*  to spend. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=249.10000000000002s)]
*  Not to mention of course, the ransom money for hostages that was also paid to the regime, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=250.28s)]
*  about six and a half billion dollars if I'm not mistaken. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=256.96s)]
*  And so all of this money is not going to help Iranian workers who are being not paid their [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=260.0s)]
*  salaries for a long time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=267.36s)]
*  Instead, it goes to support the proxies. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=268.92s)]
*  For us, if you will, the capacity of Iran with all of the oil potential there, I'm not [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=273.76s)]
*  going to ask you, should Israel bomb the oil assets or should Israel bomb the nuclear sites? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=280.64s)]
*  I know you're not going to agree to any bombing of the Iranian people, but assess the potential [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=287.08s)]
*  that Iran has in terms of that oil. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=294.0s)]
*  How do you see that? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=296.52s)]
*  Well, if you're talking overall about how much money the regime depends on to maintain [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=298.52s)]
*  a its own war machine going, finances nuclear program, pay wages to their hired help and [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=304.79999999999995s)]
*  address some aspects of running the country, it's got to give at some point. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=314.96s)]
*  They cannot sustain that kind of expenditure, especially if they are short on revenue. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  So if they in fact provoke more escalation to the point that they may be deprived of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=326.42s)]
*  that ability, it will create an incredible economic shock to the nation that will not [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=332.18s)]
*  be advantageous even to the regime itself. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=338.66s)]
*  Today, it's been about almost one week that the Iranian stock market has been dropping. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=341.62s)]
*  The dollar is more expensive now. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=348.34000000000003s)]
*  So this is even before anything happens. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=350.32s)]
*  These are all correlated. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  So I don't know how crazy or lunacy the leader in Iran has in mind to continue this warmongering. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  They already have shot themselves in the foot. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=365.97999999999996s)]
*  So it's a it's a lose lose proposition either way. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=368.28s)]
*  What I care about, however, is, of course, the welfare of my compatriots. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=371.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't want to see them yet again suffer from the consequences of this conflict. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=374.88s)]
*  And as I said, the ultimate solution is for this regime to no longer be there. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=381.34s)]
*  And the best opportunity exists right now, not only for our friends in the region, but [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=386.21999999999997s)]
*  for the whole world to understand that a change of regime in Iran will put an end to all of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=390.5s)]
*  these problems. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=396.02s)]
*  So we don't have to worry about maritime traffic and oil prices going up because there is going [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=397.02s)]
*  to be some Houthis striking commercial ships or everything else that you have there, the [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=403.08s)]
*  proliferation of this ideology period. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=410.14s)]
*  The end of this regime will mean an end to all these problems. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=413.5s)]
*  Well, which makes me believe this upcoming election is more important than ever, not [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=416.74s)]
*  just for America, but for the world. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=421.53999999999996s)]
*  Look, as long as you are in the optic, and I'm not isolating Washington only, I'm talking [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=423.82s)]
*  about Europe as well. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=431.02s)]
*  If you are focused yet again on whether or not we can appease this regime and cut a deal [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=433.0s)]
*  with them and negotiate with them and in a way expect a behavior change from this regime, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=438.02s)]
*  that simply means that we have yet to understand the DNA and nature of the system. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=443.7s)]
*  As opposed to say our best allies are the people of Iran, why don't we help them for [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=447.86s)]
*  a change and let them have a chance. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=452.02s)]
*  Your Highness, thank you. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=453.98s)]
*  We need more time with you. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=455.02s)]
*  We hope you'll come back soon. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=456.02s)]
*  The exiled crown prince of Iran, Reza Pahlavi. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=457.36s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tD1syw_mN88&t=460.22s)]
