# 'You morons!': Gen Z'ers praise bin Laden's 9/11 letter
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA)
*  12 years ago, Americans came together in celebration of the death of 9-11 mastermind Osama bin Laden, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=0.0s)]
*  the man responsible, of course, for orchestrating the ruthless deaths of nearly 3,000 innocent [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=8.28s)]
*  Americans. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=13.84s)]
*  People gathered outside of the White House chanting USA, USA, and proudly holding up [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=14.84s)]
*  American flags. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=19.2s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=20.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=21.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=22.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=23.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=24.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=25.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=26.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=27.36s)]
*  USA! [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=28.36s)]
*  But what a difference, apparently, 12 years makes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=30.32s)]
*  Fast forward to today and the terrorist leader's vile letter to America, where he justifies [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=32.96s)]
*  the September 11th terror attacks and condemns the United States for its support of Israel, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=39.2s)]
*  is going viral again. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=44.84s)]
*  Now, that Israel is at war with Hamas. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=46.32s)]
*  Some people are reading his letter and appear to be praising some of bin Laden's words all [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=48.64s)]
*  over social media. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=54.239999999999995s)]
*  William LaGiness joins us live now with the details. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=55.56s)]
*  William. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=58.28s)]
*  Well, Tammy, what happened here in the last 24 hours is emblematic of something that's [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=60.2s)]
*  happening every day. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=63.72s)]
*  Right or wrong, real or not, social media, especially TikTok, is transforming the national [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=64.96000000000001s)]
*  conversation. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=70.72s)]
*  So, here's what happened. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=71.72s)]
*  A pro-Palestinian influencer discovered a letter written by Osama bin Laden 20 years [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=72.72s)]
*  ago on the webpage of a British newspaper. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=77.64s)]
*  She then posted a video saying bin Laden, the man responsible for 9-11, was right. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=80.64s)]
*  Jews have no historical right to Israel and that he blames America for any and all violence [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=86.32s)]
*  in the Middle East. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=91.08s)]
*  Quote, I need everyone to stop what they're doing right now and go read the letter, she [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=92.08s)]
*  says, because, quote, I'm going through like an existential crisis. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=96.83999999999999s)]
*  Well, people did. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=101.52s)]
*  Her video got 2 million views and 200,000 likes, with most saying they too feel angry, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=102.88s)]
*  manipulated and lied to by U.S. media and schools. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=109.47999999999999s)]
*  The conversation then migrated to Reddit and Twitter, with hundreds of thousands commenting [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=113.48s)]
*  and posting similar views. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=118.48s)]
*  Yet most of these videos offer zero context on bin Laden, 9-11 or the beheadings celebrated [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=121.68s)]
*  by Al-Qaeda. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=127.88000000000001s)]
*  The episode underscores why congressmen like Mike Gallagher want to ban TikTok. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  These people are, of course, massive idiots. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  I just came from watching the footage that the Israeli embassy compiled about the October [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=138.24s)]
*  7th attack. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  It is horrific. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=146.16s)]
*  For someone on TikTok to somehow suggest that this is America's fault or that bin Laden, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  who killed thousands of innocent Americans, was right is absolutely disgusting and further [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  evidence that we need to ban TikTok. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=159.44s)]
*  So here's one takeaway, Tammy. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=163.0s)]
*  Americans watch 3 billion hours of TikTok every month, fully a third get their news [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=164.92s)]
*  there. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=170.28s)]
*  And the fear is this is how you're educating an entire generation. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=171.28s)]
*  There's no fact checking on TikTok and 30 second video does not make foreign history. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=173.95999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=180.2s)]
*  Thank you, William. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=181.2s)]
*  You know, Dagan, I think, you know, they are morons, but that's not the fault of TikTok. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=182.2s)]
*  That's the fault of, this is a generation since September 11th, 20 somethings are responding [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=186.67999999999998s)]
*  to this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=192.17999999999998s)]
*  And it's because of the lack of education that, you know, at least they know their pronouns, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=193.26000000000002s)]
*  right? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  But they don't know about this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  Doesn't this show us, though, the kind of the void, the intellectual void, the emotional [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=200.3s)]
*  void, the morality void? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=206.06s)]
*  If one TikTok video can sweep some young people into thinking, yeah, that's right. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=208.1s)]
*  We research just found out that almost one third of young Americans, 32% of Americans [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=214.46s)]
*  ages 18 to 29 get at least some news from TikTok. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=224.14000000000001s)]
*  But what an incredible advertisement for Gen Z. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=230.5s)]
*  Hey, we're not just egomaniacal and unmotivated and irretrievably stupid layabouts. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=234.58s)]
*  You're also immoral and heartless and pretty evil. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=243.38s)]
*  Good luck getting a job, you morons. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=248.42s)]
*  Yeah, this is the key. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=250.57999999999998s)]
*  Jeremy, would you agree that this is really, though, beyond TikTok, that this is about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=252.7s)]
*  the generation itself? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=257.8s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=258.8s)]
*  I mean, I think it's part and parcel of what's going on is you have the Chinese Communist [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=259.8s)]
*  Party that owns TikTok that is using this to brainwash our children, no doubt. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=263.98s)]
*  I mean, they're using their algorithms to make sure pro-Hamas videos are trending, to [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=268.14s)]
*  pro-Hussein bin Laden is trending. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=273.06s)]
*  I think they're mocking us. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=275.5s)]
*  I think they're saying we can brainwash your children right in front of you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=276.5s)]
*  I think that's part of it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=279.3s)]
*  But the reason why it's been successful is because our kids are so obsessed with getting [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=280.66s)]
*  likes and being popular, wanting the social media clout. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=285.54s)]
*  It is the highest good. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=289.1s)]
*  It is their one aim is just to be famous on social media, but they're willing to go along [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=290.70000000000005s)]
*  with the most ridiculous trends, like praising Hussain bin Laden in order for that. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=295.3s)]
*  And going to Emily, we know, and this is why we need more investigation into things like [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=300.06s)]
*  TikTok. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=304.17999999999995s)]
*  There is some presumption about the degree of control of China. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=305.17999999999995s)]
*  You know, we can we're connecting the dots, perhaps in suppositions, but we really still [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=308.38s)]
*  don't know exactly about algorithms and how this is moving combined with, you know, the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=313.9s)]
*  empty headedness of a certain generation. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=318.58s)]
*  So that's why we need to look more into something like that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  Emily, where do you think we go from here? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=324.26s)]
*  Oh, gosh. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  That's the hardest question. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=327.09999999999997s)]
*  I feel like I'm at this universe pageant. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=328.58000000000004s)]
*  World peace. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=331.38s)]
*  I that's such a I'm overwhelmed by that question because this entire situation is so overwhelming. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=332.38s)]
*  When you talk about sort of ascertaining and identifying the algorithms to me, I just see [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=338.38s)]
*  that we are the product of a very deliberate machination that has been years in the making, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  decades in the making, and they are winning. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=348.66s)]
*  We are at the behest of the CCP. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=350.74s)]
*  We are at the behest of a socialist and communist movement that has had as its goal social agitation [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=352.66s)]
*  and civil and political unrest in this country, and they are succeeding. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=359.90000000000003s)]
*  And the proof is in the fact that just one TikTok post posting a letter that we denounce [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=363.66s)]
*  that is disgusting, that that somehow opens the eyes of our children. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=368.86s)]
*  Shame on the parents. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=375.18s)]
*  Shame on this government. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=376.18s)]
*  Something needs to change. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=377.18s)]
*  Wrap that up for us. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=378.18s)]
*  You know, I was at the White House the night that Osama bin Laden died, ran down with my [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=379.18s)]
*  friends and I think it was because we were the 9 11 generation. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=382.18s)]
*  Everybody likes give millennials a hard time. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=385.22s)]
*  Those were our friends. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=387.58s)]
*  That was my brother, our siblings who went and served. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=388.58s)]
*  And God forbid anything happens to our country. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=391.86s)]
*  But this generation doesn't know the firsthand effect of the consequences of terrorists on [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=394.82s)]
*  our country. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=399.98s)]
*  And I think that's a really big problem to combine with all the algorithms and all the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-3j5e4PMwHA&t=400.98s)]
