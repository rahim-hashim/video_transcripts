# Israel-Hamas war entering most dangerous phase to date
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE)
*  Israel's counteroffensive against Hamas entering perhaps its most dangerous phase yet. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF trying to take control of the terror group's vast maze of tunnels, some of them [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=5.5600000000000005s)]
*  stretching for hundreds of miles. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=10.24s)]
*  Meantime, we're learning new and harrowing details from hostages who were held captive [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=12.0s)]
*  by the Iranian back group. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=16.56s)]
*  Let's get to Alex Hogan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=18.2s)]
*  She was reporting live from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=19.2s)]
*  Alex? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=21.28s)]
*  Hi, Dana. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=22.28s)]
*  The IDF says through an airstrike in the West Bank, it targeted and killed a top Palestinian [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=24.48s)]
*  militant who specifically tried to and planned attacks against Israelis in Jerusalem. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=29.32s)]
*  Now, as far as the latest stage of the war in Gaza, Israel's defense minister says that [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  the maneuvering in the north has now come to an end, but it is worth noting that there [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=38.92s)]
*  are still pockets of fighting very much underway in the north. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=43.28s)]
*  The focus really is now shifting to the central part of Gaza, areas like Chanyunias, where [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=47.28s)]
*  today the IDF uncovered a new system of tunnels. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=52.68s)]
*  This week says that the fighting in the south will soon start to wind down, but giving no [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  word on a timing on that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  But that is where the majority of the nearly two million people who are displaced have [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  fled dire conditions. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=67.96000000000001s)]
*  There is the U.N. warns of the growing risk of widespread famine. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=69.56s)]
*  The U.N. also says that 152 of its staffers have been killed in Gaza since the start of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=73.44s)]
*  the war. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=78.48s)]
*  Now, back here in Israel, our team joined Sharon Cunio, one of the freed hostages who [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=79.48s)]
*  returned to her home where she hid with her husband and her twin three-year-old daughters [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=84.12s)]
*  on October 7th. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=88.36000000000001s)]
*  Hamas militants set their house on fire, so the couple made the decision either stay inside [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=89.76s)]
*  that home and burn alive or climb out of the window and get shot. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=94.28s)]
*  The family chose the latter, but instead of being killed, they were taken captive into [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=98.64s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=102.92s)]
*  Sharon and the girls are now free, but her husband David is still captive. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=103.92s)]
*  To my love, David, if there's any chance you're hearing this, I will do the best I can. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=108.68s)]
*  You are coming home, I promise you that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=115.68s)]
*  France and Qatar have now brokered a deal to send in medication that the hostages remaining [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=121.08000000000001s)]
*  in Gaza so desperately need. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=126.2s)]
*  Forty-five of the more than 100 hostages have chronic illnesses and need those medications. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=128.4s)]
*  I talked with one doctor here, Dana in Tel Aviv, who says despite this being a hopeful [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=133.08s)]
*  moment that these hostages might be able to get that medication, they have still been [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=137.84s)]
*  without it for more than 100 days. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=141.76s)]
*  Dana. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=144.44s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mi6_mE8OE&t=145.44s)]
