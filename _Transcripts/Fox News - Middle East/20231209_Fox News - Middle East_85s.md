# UPenn president resigns after testimony to Congress on antisemitism
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0)
*  Gloria, some stunning breaking news in the college campuses. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=0.0s)]
*  Multiple reports in Pennsylvania say that Liz McGill, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=3.14s)]
*  the president of the University of Pennsylvania, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=6.2s)]
*  has resigned from her post at the elite Ivy League school. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=8.36s)]
*  You know, this comes after that intense backlash [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=12.56s)]
*  to her testimony and that of others [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=15.38s)]
*  on Capitol Hill this past week, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=17.0s)]
*  after she said calling for the genocide of Jews [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=18.96s)]
*  is harassment, depending on the context. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=21.46s)]
*  We're told the UPenn Board of Trustees [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=24.82s)]
*  that reportedly held an emergency meeting about all this, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=26.84s)]
*  and McGill, we are told, will reportedly stay on [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=30.24s)]
*  as interim president of UPenn [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=34.16s)]
*  until an interim president is appointed. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=36.08s)]
*  She will continue her work as a faculty member [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=38.76s)]
*  on the faculty of that elite Ivy League school. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=41.32s)]
*  You know, her resignation could be the first [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  of several others. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=47.08s)]
*  That hearing sparked a fury of controversy [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=48.4s)]
*  as the president of Harvard, Cliding Gay. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=50.56s)]
*  She had to walk back and then apologize [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=53.14s)]
*  for her not condemning calls for genocide against Jews [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=55.68s)]
*  that have been heard on the elite Ivy League campuses [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=59.22s)]
*  the past few weeks. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=62.48s)]
*  McGill, the UPenn president, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=64.48s)]
*  also did not criticize such language during that hearing. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=66.2s)]
*  It is seen as a widespread condemnation [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=69.24s)]
*  of the failures of higher education in this country [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=72.32s)]
*  and the values that some of our students are being taught [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=75.36s)]
*  when these universities cannot even condemn [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=78.72s)]
*  the genocide of Jews. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w6XrcE86Ki0&t=81.78s)]
