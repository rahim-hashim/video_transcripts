# Hezbollah, Iran launch rocket attacks as tensions rise in Mideast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA)
*  All right, meanwhile, 17 minutes after the hour, Fox News of America troops are heard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=0.0s)]
*  after a rocket attack on Al-Assad air base over in Western Iraq yesterday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=5.26s)]
*  Trey Yanks joins us live from Israel port city of Hafea. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=9.88s)]
*  He's live with us right now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=15.08s)]
*  Hey, Trey. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=16.8s)]
*  Yeah, hey, guys. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=17.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=18.8s)]
*  I do want to start with some breaking news. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=19.8s)]
*  As Israel braces for an attack from Iran and its proxies, the largest proxy in the region, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=22.0s)]
*  Hezbollah in southern Lebanon, just launched a rocket and drone attack into northern Israel, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=27.12s)]
*  just a few miles from where we're standing right now. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=32.8s)]
*  According to reports from first responders, two people were injured by shrapnel, one critically [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  wounded and taken to a local hospital. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=41.04s)]
*  But it gives you a sense that while Israel is preparing for that larger conflict, they're [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=43.8s)]
*  still being attacked on a daily basis. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=47.8s)]
*  We're also following this other update out of the region overnight, an Iran-backed militia [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=50.24s)]
*  targeting a base in Western Iraq that houses American forces. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=54.78s)]
*  Multiple U.S. service members were injured in that attack, again, launched by a militia [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=59.660000000000004s)]
*  that's backed by Iran. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=64.38s)]
*  The timing of that incident couldn't have occurred at a worst moment as tensions rise [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=66.06s)]
*  across the Middle East. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=70.2s)]
*  President Biden was at the White House being updated on the expected Iranian attack that [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=71.9s)]
*  is planned against Israel when that took place. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=75.98s)]
*  The commander in chief posting to X that he was briefed. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=78.5s)]
*  And there are efforts to de-escalate the situation, going on to say we also discuss the steps [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=81.54s)]
*  we are taking to defend our forces and respond to any attack against our personnel in a manner [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=86.34s)]
*  and place of our choosing. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=91.06s)]
*  The question now is how the United States will respond and what role the Americans will [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=92.64s)]
*  play in defending Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=96.14s)]
*  Iranian officials briefed foreign ministers of other countries yesterday and confirmed [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=98.30000000000001s)]
*  they do plan to strike Israel in response to the killing of Hamas political leader Ismail [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=101.9s)]
*  Haniyeh in Tehran. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=106.22s)]
*  This comes as the war in Gaza grinds on and we are following a new development about the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=107.88s)]
*  United Nations. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=111.53999999999999s)]
*  The U.N. announced yesterday it had fired nine UNRWA staffers for suspected involvement [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=112.82s)]
*  in the October 7th massacre. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=117.32s)]
*  Right now there are simply no diplomatic solutions on the table to end the war inside Gaza, de-escalate [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=119.42s)]
*  with Hezbollah in Lebanon and avoid a larger attack from Iran, meaning Israel is bracing [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=124.89999999999999s)]
*  for uncertain and dangerous days ahead. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=130.32s)]
*  Guys? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=132.96s)]
*  Hey Trey, why would they list? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=133.96s)]
*  What do you think of Iran? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=135.72s)]
*  Why would they list possible sites they were going to hit ahead of time? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=136.72s)]
*  What are they trying to do? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=140.24s)]
*  They're trying to play a game of psychological warfare with the Israeli people and the Israelis [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=143.52s)]
*  are doing the same. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=148.07999999999998s)]
*  They have made very clear that if the Iranians target civilian areas of Israel in cities [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=149.24s)]
*  like Haifa where we're at today or Tel Aviv or Jerusalem, the Israelis will respond, striking [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=154.36s)]
*  Iran again. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=159.82s)]
*  And remember, Iran launched an attack against Israel in April, firing more than 300 drones [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=161.14s)]
*  and missiles at this country. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=166.24s)]
*  And while many were intercepted by coalition forces, the Israelis struck back against a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=167.6s)]
*  very interesting target, air defense systems outside of Iran's nuclear facility, the largest [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=171.84s)]
*  one in the country. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=176.84s)]
*  This was to send a message. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=178.0s)]
*  The Israelis know exactly where they're developing their nuclear program and it's in their sites. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=179.16s)]
*  Alright, Trey, we thank you very much. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=183.24s)]
*  Also the United States is sending a message as well. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=185.8s)]
*  The USS Laboon and the USS Cole have been repositioned in the Red Sea and the Teddy [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=188.68s)]
*  Roosevelt aircraft carrier group is moving toward Israel as well. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=194.28s)]
*  The big stick. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=199.28s)]
*  That goes back to the question, why isn't Kamala Harris? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=200.28s)]
*  Why isn't Joe Biden? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=203.29999999999998s)]
*  Why are we hearing from them when you have all of this happening in the Middle East? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=204.29999999999998s)]
*  We got a tweet picture. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=207.48s)]
*  Yeah, it was Selena Zito. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=209.28s)]
*  She posted this, mark it down, how many thousands of points since last Wednesday. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=212.0s)]
*  The Middle East is at the brink of a war. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=217.16s)]
*  Iran bombed our military base in Iraq. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=219.6s)]
*  How is it OK that we haven't heard from the president? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=222.2s)]
*  How is it that the White House correspondents aren't publicly calling for this? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's unbelievable. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=228.28s)]
*  Don't you want to do your job? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=229.28s)]
*  Aren't you frustrated that you can't get any questions off? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=230.28s)]
*  Don't you want to know why the flip-flops happened? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=232.72s)]
*  But the same thing, there was no clamor for President Biden to do a press conference. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=234.56s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=238.0s)]
*  Well, until the terrible debate. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=239.0s)]
*  We got all of this information yesterday. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=240.0s)]
*  We were teasing it on every program that there was going to be this big national security [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=241.88s)]
*  meeting, that everybody was going to be meeting, the council was going to be in the bunker, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=246.12s)]
*  literally laying it out in the situation room. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=251.04s)]
*  And I guess we assumed that there was going to be some type of public statement after. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=253.72s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=257.2s)]
*  No press conference, no red line for America. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=258.88s)]
*  It looks like the only people that are getting the pressure is the Israelis right now saying [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=262.56s)]
*  just get a deal done. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=266.36s)]
*  Well yesterday the press secretary didn't even have her normal gaggle. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=268.0s)]
*  She does have one planned for this afternoon. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=272.44s)]
*  They're always so informative. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=274.15999999999997s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see what they have to say about this, about the two things, about [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=275.32s)]
*  what's going on in Iran and also what is going on with your 401K. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JU296kaBBXA&t=279.72s)]
