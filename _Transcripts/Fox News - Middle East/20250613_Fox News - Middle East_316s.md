# Iran launches waves of missiles at Tel Aviv
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU)
*  because there's something else happening in Tel Aviv, Trey? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=0.0s)]
*  Yeah, John, we got an alert that more Iranian missiles are [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=4.4s)]
*  incoming, and I'm going to have my cameraman, Yaniv, pan to the [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=7.36s)]
*  sky here. And in the distance, you see that again, that small [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=10.92s)]
*  dot of light is an indication that they have started to [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=14.120000000000001s)]
*  launch some of these interception rounds to try to [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=18.56s)]
*  shoot down the incoming fire. I'm told that there are alerts [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=21.54s)]
*  across the entirety of Israel spanning not just from the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=25.8s)]
*  central part of this country in places like Tel Aviv and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=28.4s)]
*  Jerusalem, but also in the northern city of Haifa. I do [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  want to update on our last report about a number of [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=36.64s)]
*  injuries. Local medics have now raised the number of injured to [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=39.12s)]
*  seven, seven locations, excuse me, and they're searching to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=43.839999999999996s)]
*  ensure that people are not wounded seriously or killed in [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=49.86s)]
*  these locations. They are not sure yet. Israeli media says [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=54.04s)]
*  that several are lightly wounded and you can hear some [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=57.96s)]
*  sirens as first responders. And this is an ambulance going on [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=61.68s)]
*  the street below us. I can see a few police officers and it is [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=66.52s)]
*  headed toward a location where there was a missile impact [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=70.72s)]
*  before. And John, again, just as we talk here, you're going to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=73.12s)]
*  see live on your screen. Those are interceptor rounds coming [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=76.0s)]
*  from the sea headed towards central Israel, an indication [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=79.2s)]
*  that any moment we can expect more missiles coming in. And I'm [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=82.72s)]
*  going to have Yaniv pan to the skyline over here. We've got [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=86.32s)]
*  more interceptor rounds coming off of the skyline of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=89.55999999999999s)]
*  And so as we talk here, a lot of things are going to change very [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=94.55999999999999s)]
*  quickly. But the bottom line here is that the Israeli military [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=98.16s)]
*  is confirming dozens of ballistic missiles are headed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=102.0s)]
*  again toward central Israel. They are telling people to [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=105.96s)]
*  remain inside shelters. We have very limited information about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=109.35999999999999s)]
*  the impact sites. But as you could confirm from that video [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=114.2s)]
*  that we saw and I watched it back, serious locations inside [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=117.39999999999999s)]
*  central Israel were hit with ballistic missiles. Just yet [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=122.56s)]
*  another indication of how difficult it is to intercept [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=125.8s)]
*  this incoming fire. And now we have a lot of interceptor rounds [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=130.04s)]
*  coming off. And I'm just going to count them here as we're [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=132.88s)]
*  talking one, two, three, four coming off of the sea and one in [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  the distance. And so again, John, this is going to move very [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=140.04s)]
*  quickly. But people in central Israel remain in shelters [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=143.2s)]
*  preparing for the incoming fire from Iran. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=146.67999999999998s)]
*  And Trey, as you and Jen Griffin identified unprecedented [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=149.83999999999997s)]
*  amount of missile activity that we're seeing right now, I just [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=153.79999999999998s)]
*  want to read in full the idea of statement that just came in [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=156.76s)]
*  shout if we need to get back here. We're watching the live [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  sky over Tel Aviv right now. The idea says the attack is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=162.28s)]
*  ongoing. Dozens of additional missiles were launched toward [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=165.44s)]
*  the state of Israel. You are requested to continue to follow [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=168.64s)]
*  the instructions of the home front command and the [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=171.56s)]
*  instructions sent to you. The explosions you're hearing are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=173.64000000000001s)]
*  from the interceptions were fallen projectiles. The IDF [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=176.6s)]
*  repeats and emphasizes not to publish and share the locations [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=181.12s)]
*  and footage of the hits. The aerial defense is currently [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=185.48s)]
*  identifying and intercepting these launches as you just [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=189.16s)]
*  pointed out, Trey. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=192.04s)]
*  Yep, we've got some interceptor rounds coming off of the skyline [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=194.72s)]
*  of Tel Aviv and you may see some explosions here. Again, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=199.64s)]
*  just stay with me because this is all going to change very [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=202.83999999999997s)]
*  quickly. My cameraman, Yanniv, is going to follow these [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=205.64s)]
*  interceptor rounds as they come up to see if there's any sort of [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=209.83999999999997s)]
*  interception. Again, it's tough to tell from our vantage point [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=215.27999999999997s)]
*  which missile defense systems are being used, but the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=219.67999999999998s)]
*  Israelis have a variety of advanced systems from David [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=222.2s)]
*  sling to the Arrow two and three system. And of course, the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=225.04s)]
*  Patriot missile defense systems that were provided by the [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=228.0s)]
*  Americans as we try to gather more information about what the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=230.92s)]
*  targets are for the Iranians. I can just tell you this is very [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=234.16s)]
*  different from the missile attacks that we saw back in [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=237.64s)]
*  April of last year and October of last year. And it's yet [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=241.48s)]
*  another indication of the situation at hand. The Israelis [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=245.04s)]
*  clearly are continuing waves of strikes. They are targeting not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=250.16s)]
*  only nuclear facilities in Iran, but killing top military [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=254.44s)]
*  officials from the IRGC. And already the Iranians say they [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=258.2s)]
*  have replaced some of these positions because they [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=262.68s)]
*  understand they are now in a direct confrontation with [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=264.88s)]
*  Israel. And I do want to just convey to you a little bit of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=267.96s)]
*  what I'm seeing in Israeli media. They're showing damage at [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=271.68s)]
*  one site. It appears to show a road that is damaged and part of [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=274.84s)]
*  building some windows that were smashed. And again, no injuries [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=280.56s)]
*  at this location. But first responders are going to what we [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=285.59999999999997s)]
*  understand are seven different scenes across central Israel. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=289.59999999999997s)]
*  And again, the skyline here, you need if you'll pull out, you're [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=293.08s)]
*  going to see more interceptor rounds coming off of the skyline [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=295.91999999999996s)]
*  as this missile attack continues against Israel. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F9JPay2rXSU&t=299.03999999999996s)]
