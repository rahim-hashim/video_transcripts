# Iran will ‘coordinate’ with Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthis against Israel, expert predicts
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8)
*  All right, could a feared Iran retaliatory strike on Israel be stopped if a ceasefire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=0.0s)]
*  deal is made between Israel and Hamas? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=10.36s)]
*  That's the hope at least. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=12.36s)]
*  It's enough that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is in the Middle East right [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=13.8s)]
*  now to shepherd that process along. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=17.48s)]
*  But will it happen that way, even if there is such a deal? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=21.12s)]
*  Lieutenant General David Deptula joins us. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=23.64s)]
*  One of the best of the best, kind enough to sort of pick this apart. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=26.52s)]
*  General, that's what people hope for, I guess, and understandably. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=30.2s)]
*  But there is no quid pro quo, technically. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=33.84s)]
*  What do you think happens, let's say Hamas and Israel agree on something? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=36.36s)]
*  Well, Neil, like you described, it's an extraordinarily complex situation. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=42.24s)]
*  And we have to be careful that we don't mirror image, because what the Mullah leadership [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=48.72s)]
*  in Iran wants to have happen is very different than what the leadership in the United States [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=54.76s)]
*  in the West want to have happen in the context of tamping down any particular conflict in [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=64.03999999999999s)]
*  the region. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=72.92s)]
*  So Iran has got to play this carefully, because what they're doing is trying to figure out [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=74.56s)]
*  a way to save face in light of its failure to protect a key Hamas leader without incurring [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=78.68s)]
*  the wrath of Israel that it knows it can crush them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=84.92s)]
*  Now, the fact that it's been this long and Iran has not done anything. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=89.4s)]
*  Now, to your point, I think last time you chatted, you talk about proxies of what they're [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=94.04s)]
*  doing, Hezbollah and Hamas and the Houthi rebels have always seem to be doing something to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=98.2s)]
*  disturb commerce in the region, but nothing from Iran directly. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=102.52000000000001s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  We are talking about in the current issue. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=109.64s)]
*  I mean, in April, we saw some direct response from Iran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=112.2s)]
*  I think part of the reason you have seen a bit of a delay, not a bit of a delay, but [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=116.76s)]
*  a delay in Iran's response is some of the deterrent measures that have been taken to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=123.0s)]
*  include the significant deployment of U.S. forces to the area. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=129.4s)]
*  And I've got to highlight the fact that F-22s were part of that deployment. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=134.28s)]
*  And the reason that's significant is Iran has no effective defense against them, and [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=139.64000000000001s)]
*  they know that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=144.6s)]
*  So that's making the Iranian mullahs think twice about the degree of their next military [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=146.12s)]
*  move. And like you mentioned, it is going to bring into play its auxiliaries, the three [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=152.6s)]
*  Hs, Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis, into its equation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=159.16s)]
*  And I wouldn't be surprised to see a coordinated set of attacks launched from those countries. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=163.4s)]
*  General, we'll watch it very closely. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=170.84s)]
*  I'm sure you're watching it extremely closely. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=172.28s)]
*  Always enjoy your expertise, sir. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYYCNk3UGc8&t=174.92s)]
