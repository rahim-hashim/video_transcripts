# Mark Levin: Why is Biden lecturing Israel?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0)
*  Welcome back, America. We're here with Professor Eugene Kantorovich, professor at the Antonin [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=0.0s)]
*  Scalia School of Law here in the United States. He's also a scholar at the Kohelet Policy [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=8.24s)]
*  Forum. Professor, let's get to it. Why are you being lectured in Israel constantly about [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=14.6s)]
*  the rules of law and proportionality when you're up against a terrorist enemy that wants [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=19.6s)]
*  to blow out every Jew in Israel? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=23.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's a little bit obnoxious when President Biden comes over and he said many nice things, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  but then he said, of course, don't punish Gazan civilians, don't engage in collective [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=32.84s)]
*  punishment, as if Israel would ever do such a thing. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=36.160000000000004s)]
*  Biden has an interest. He needs to support Israel, you know, at least openly and somewhat [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=39.160000000000004s)]
*  to not lose the Jewish vote in the elections, but he also wants to keep this fight contained [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=44.0s)]
*  and keep Israel from going all the way and actually taking out its enemies, because Hamas, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=49.28s)]
*  the people who perpetrated this horrible massacre, are simply puppets of Iran. And of course, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=54.6s)]
*  Biden's Middle East policy, like Obama's, has been focused on making nice with Iran. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=59.800000000000004s)]
*  He transferred $6 billion to Iran. He lifted sanctions on Iran. So in the end, Israel cannot [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=64.68s)]
*  be safe unless it takes out its Iranian-backed proxies on its doorstep, Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=71.92s)]
*  But ultimately, Iran needs to be dealt with also. And the bigger this war gets, the more [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=78.16s)]
*  it's going to be a reminder of Biden's failed Middle Eastern policy and his appeasement [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=83.16s)]
*  of Iran. So he wants Israel to do something, because he understands Israel has to do something, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=87.8s)]
*  but he does not necessarily support Israel going all the way, taking out Hamas and actually [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=93.28s)]
*  preventing it from coming back, because that's what Israel really needs to do. A country [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=97.72s)]
*  cannot live with a massacre like this every 20 years, which means Israel must take out [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=101.72s)]
*  Hamas and it must make sure it never comes back. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=105.72s)]
*  And to see how you do that, you have to look at Nazi Germany, which was also a totalitarian [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=108.82s)]
*  society, authoritarian society, but with broad popular support. That means you have to come, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=112.64s)]
*  you have to take over, and you have to make them really understand that they lost and [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=118.24s)]
*  go through a denazification policy. It means you have to change the borders. It means you [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=121.56s)]
*  have to really get rid of all the bad guys and not let the people who supported them [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=126.8s)]
*  come back into power. That is a long task. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=131.76s)]
*  Biden does not want Israel to go that far. He's already said it. He said, we don't want [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=134.76s)]
*  you to end up occupying Gaza. But that's what America did with Nazi Germany. That's the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=138.28s)]
*  only way to get these guys out. And without that, this is just going to be like a cancer [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=142.84s)]
*  that grows back again, God forbid. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=147.12s)]
*  And just so America understands, the Gaza Strip was fought for. The Egyptians were defeated. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=149.12s)]
*  Israel controlled it. And then Israel tried an experiment. It gave the Gaza Strip to the [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=158.68s)]
*  Palestinians who elected a terrorist regime that has used this so-called two-state solution [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=164.44s)]
*  to try and pursue a final solution, correct? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=170.68s)]
*  It's very important to note, Israel pulled out all the soldiers, all the civilians from [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=172.92s)]
*  Gaza in 2005. People were saying, oh, the settlers are the problem. Everyone came out. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=178.12s)]
*  They handed it over to Fatah. Now, Fatah was immediately replaced by Hamas, which is actually [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=183.04s)]
*  much more powerful. That's a reason not to hand it over to Fatah again. They're not going [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=187.92s)]
*  And since then, they have pursued a genocidal campaign against Israel. So what have we seen? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=192.64s)]
*  The only thing that prevents these kind of attacks, the only thing that prevents this [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=197.23999999999998s)]
*  from being used as a base for Holocaust-like massacres of Jews is Israeli control over [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=200.48s)]
*  the territory. That is the only thing that has proved effective, controlled by the Palestinian [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=206.16s)]
*  Authority. Fatah has not worked, and obviously Hamas doesn't work. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  All right, Professor, we appreciate your input very, very much. So what's strange to me is [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  the lectures to the victim where people were just slaughtered and that the Israelis don't [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=220.08s)]
*  fight wars to slaughter people. They fight wars to defend themselves. And these constant [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=227.88s)]
*  lectures by Biden and the Obama people who surround him, they're not just obnoxious. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=232.36s)]
*  They send exactly the wrong signal to the enemy. Thank you, Professor, and God bless [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=238.24s)]
*  you. Thank you for having me on, Mark. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sA5rHhI_L_0&t=242.08s)]
