# 'DESPICABLE': Israeli journalist issues stark warning on terror
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0)
*  Let's bring in former IDF combat soldier Lillette Chimesh, who served in the Border Police unit [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=0.0s)]
*  Lillette good morning to you. You just heard trea Yang say this is not gonna be a three or four day war [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=7.26s)]
*  It will drag on until Hamas is destroyed [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=11.98s)]
*  So what are soldiers up against in the lead-up to this potential ground invasion? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=15.94s)]
*  Yeah, hi, thank you for having me so I wasn't just a combat soldier [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=23.22s)]
*  I'm still doing my reserve service and I'm working as a news anchor in channel 14 here in Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=27.3s)]
*  The entire country is being recruited to fight this war to fight this war against [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  Terrorism to fight this war against Hamas [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=39.06s)]
*  We haven't seen a slaughter like this in Israel in the 75 years of Israel's existence [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=41.9s)]
*  This is a second Holocaust for us [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  And I think the entire world should join Israel in the fight against this Islamic radical [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=51.2s)]
*  Terrorists you reported earlier this morning about the ISIS flag who was found in one of the terrorist bags [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=57.5s)]
*  And I think it's important for you to understand [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=64.28s)]
*  This is no different than what is ISIS has been doing in Europe [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=66.97999999999999s)]
*  And I think we have to stand together and to fight [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=71.74s)]
*  Hamas and if anyone cares about the Palestinians and you are reporting about the situation in Gaza [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=76.14s)]
*  If anyone cares about the Palestinians, they should free the Palestinians from Hamas [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=81.22s)]
*  The Palestinians have democratically elected Hamas [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=86.26s)]
*  And I think if they want to see a better future if they want to see a better environment in the Middle East [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=89.9s)]
*  They should not support terror organizations controlling the Gaza Strip [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  and it's no different than what is happening now in the Palestinian Authority because Abu Mazen is also [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=100.82000000000001s)]
*  Using the pay-for-stay method Abu Mazen is also paying families of terrorists [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=106.26s)]
*  It's also educating people to go and murder Jews [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=110.48s)]
*  So you tell me how us as Jews as Israeli as the only democracy in the Middle East should react to this [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=113.86s)]
*  To these horrors literally horrors that we've experienced in the past week [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=121.94s)]
*  You are both a former soldier and a journalist like you mentioned [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=126.78s)]
*  What is the latest you are hearing from the front lines this morning? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=130.38s)]
*  And when when do you think the ground assault from IDF will begin? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=133.74s)]
*  So at the moment we don't really know when when is it going to begin or how the IDF would operate in this situation [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=139.94s)]
*  All I know is that Israel is united. Israel is united to fight and to fight hard [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=149.54s)]
*  We've heard Prime Minister Netanyahu saying yesterday on the press conference that he and us as a country will chase every [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=155.7s)]
*  Hamas terrorist every Hamas member [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=163.82s)]
*  We will chase them down because after seeing the horrors of what we've experienced on the recent Saturday of them [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=166.7s)]
*  Butchering entire families lighting up in fire houses of families [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=174.26s)]
*  Beheading people raping women [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=179.6s)]
*  I've never seen anything like that and I've been ago [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=181.7s)]
*  I've been through so many wars here in Israel the second Lebanon war war with Iraq [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=185.38s)]
*  We had rockets with Lebanon rockets from from Hamas. I've never seen anything like that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=189.73999999999998s)]
*  This is just despicable and I think the entire world should should unite with Israel in the war in [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=195.27999999999997s)]
*  what we're seeing now in Israel because Israel is the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=203.48s)]
*  spearhead in the war of terrorism and any country who would just [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=206.83999999999997s)]
*  Not look and what is happening now will get that in their backyards when you're when you've seen the people after 9-eleven [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=211.79999999999998s)]
*  cheering [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=220.27999999999997s)]
*  Palestinians in the street handing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=221.48s)]
*  Candies this is no different than what we're seeing now. This is no different from the calls in Sydney of [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=223.67999999999998s)]
*  pro-Palestinians [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=229.6s)]
*  Chanting gas the Jews. This is horrible. Yeah, and I think the world [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  Stop it now because what you will not care about what is happening in Israel [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=236.67999999999998s)]
*  Hey, we'll tell ya before before we let you go [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=241.56s)]
*  I just want to get your reaction to this because you are a member of the media. You're a journalist yourself [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=243.56s)]
*  Did you happen to hear the press conference with President Herzog? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=247.28s)]
*  He was taking questions from the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=250.44s)]
*  International media and it was really hostile and a lot of the questions were vilifying Israel for turning off the water and [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=252.12s)]
*  Electricity in the Gaza Strip. What do you make of that? I [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=258.72s)]
*  Think the world should wake up and understand what Israel is experiencing and time and again and I've been covering how the international media [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=263.6s)]
*  Is treating Israel whenever there is a terror attack always talking about the Palestinian side when we are in fact [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=272.44s)]
*  The democracy who's getting hurt by terrorists and I think it's a shame that the international media [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=278.92s)]
*  time and again finding excuses finding [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=285.8s)]
*  Excuses for butchering Jews for murdering Jews [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=290.16s)]
*  This is no different than what ISIS has done in Europe and what Boko Haram has done in Africa [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=293.64s)]
*  And I think it's pure anti-semitism to keep finding excuses to why is it okay to murder Jews? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=299.3s)]
*  It was an it was an embarrassing display from the foreign press Lita al-shemesh [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLtNaeJe-Q0&t=306.04s)]
