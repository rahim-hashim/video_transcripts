# U.S. military bolsters readiness in Middle East amid targeted attacks
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE)
*  Let's bring in Florida Congressman and Army veteran Michael Waltz. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=0.0s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=2.96s)]
*  We're hearing that this is the largest ground invasionâ€”ground incursion into the Gaza [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=5.5200000000000005s)]
*  Strip since this war began. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=9.96s)]
*  So what stands out to you about this news that we are waking up to this morning? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=11.48s)]
*  Well, Carly, I think you're going to continue to see these limited incursions, whether that's [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=16.28s)]
*  taking out terrorist headquarters and command and control, rocket sites, rocket manufacturing [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=23.4s)]
*  sites, or trying to rescue hostages when they are finding information and they believe it's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=30.04s)]
*  safe enough to try to rescue. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=39.36s)]
*  But clearly, what is standing out to me is the administration and the president is pressing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  Israel to slow roll this invasion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=47.68s)]
*  I believe it's for a few reasons from folks that I'm talking to. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=51.28s)]
*  Number one, they want more aid. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=55.160000000000004s)]
*  The administration wants more aid into Gaza to prevent a massive humanitarian crisis. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=57.72s)]
*  Remember, there are Americans, 500 to 600 estimated Americans still in Gaza, Palestinian [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=64.84s)]
*  Americans that apparently Hamas is not allowing to leave. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=71.64s)]
*  And then finally, the hostages. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=76.6s)]
*  And this is such a confounding, difficult problem for the IDF to deal with. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=79.08s)]
*  At the end of the day, I believe they're just going to have to go in and get out as [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=86.56s)]
*  many as they can, because Hamas has clearly taken a strategy of trickling out just a few [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=91.08s)]
*  to buy time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=97.88s)]
*  Yeah, there is also reporting that Israel agreed to delay this ground invasion because [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=98.88s)]
*  the United States needs time to rush in missile defense systems to the region. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=103.8s)]
*  There was a time not too long ago where we did have a larger military presence in the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=108.56s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=112.72s)]
*  So should we be in a position where we need to rush these defense systems in? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=113.72s)]
*  Well, remember, we had this the administration talking about the pivot to Asia to deal with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=118.52s)]
*  the growing threat of the Chinese Communist Party, and we shifted assets out. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=126.03999999999999s)]
*  We had Jake Sullivan saying just a few weeks ago the Middle East was perfectly calm and [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=130.54s)]
*  quiet. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=135.5s)]
*  He even wrote a large treaties on how quiet it was that he's now had to retract. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=136.5s)]
*  My frustration and watching us rush these systems in and ask the Israelis to slow down [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=142.98s)]
*  until we do is if we have had maximum pressure on Iran, if we had starved Iran of the funds [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  last administration, we could probably still leave those assets in the Pacific because [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=156.22s)]
*  Iran wouldn't have the money to have given to its proxies all of these weapons and training, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=163.1s)]
*  which we're also finding out that Iran has trained several hundred elite Palestinians, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=171.06s)]
*  according to the Wall Street Journal. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=176.66s)]
*  At the end of the day, I think we are having to get things back in there to help them deal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=178.42s)]
*  with this, but we wouldn't have had to if we had the right Iran policy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=185.06s)]
*  And Congressman, now that they do have the money, it feels like we're playing a game [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=188.74s)]
*  with chess with an enemy that is more than willing to plunge us into World War III. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  So how does Israel beat Hamas without this becoming a larger war? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=196.78s)]
*  You know, sometimes with a bully, and in this case with Iran, you have to punch him in the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=204.3s)]
*  nose. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=211.7s)]
*  That's what we did with Soleimani and deterrence was restored. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=212.73999999999998s)]
*  But we continue to hear from Blinken, from the president and others, Garnet will defend [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=216.61999999999998s)]
*  ourselves vigorously and if necessary, will take action. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=222.06s)]
*  Well, after 30 wounded soldiers and nearly 90 attacks on our bases in the last two years, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=226.33999999999997s)]
*  when does this administration find it necessary to punch the bully in the nose? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=233.85999999999999s)]
*  Because that's the only thing it's going to respond to. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=238.1s)]
*  It's going to get away with these attacks as long as it can, and it's going to arm [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=240.06s)]
*  and fund and train its proxies as long as we let them get away with it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=243.9s)]
*  You mentioned those service members who have already been injured by drone and rocket attacks [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=247.5s)]
*  on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=251.42000000000002s)]
*  And now we're learning that U.S.-led forces began live-fire exercise in Iraq and Syria [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=253.9s)]
*  after American military bases were attacked. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=259.1s)]
*  The Joint Task Force is saying coalition service members will be conducting ground operational [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=261.26s)]
*  exercises in or near the al-Husayn region in Syria to validate weapons systems and maintain [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=267.41999999999996s)]
*  crew proficiency and readiness. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=275.73999999999995s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=277.41999999999996s)]
*  Well, it means that we are posturing forces around. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  We're conducting exercises. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=285.58s)]
*  We're shooting munitions at ranges. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=287.34s)]
*  Look, you can have the toughest, meanest-looking military in the region that the world's ever [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=291.5s)]
*  seen, but if your adversary doesn't believe you have the political will to actually use [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=296.86s)]
*  it against them, as I just said, to punch the bully in the nose sometimes to get them [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=301.98s)]
*  to back down, then I think it's essentially going to be a show and it's essentially going [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=306.54s)]
*  to be symbolic. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=313.34000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it sounds like your message this morning is peace through strengths. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=314.3s)]
*  Congressman Walz, thank you for joining us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=318.22s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMpcgWHJAE&t=320.14s)]
