# Israel strikes Hamas targets within Gaza with airstrikes
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik)
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls this the second war of independence. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks on the ground in southern Israel with the latest from there. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=3.52s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=6.72s)]
*  Trey Yanks, Israeli Prime Minister of Israel [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=7.72s)]
*  Yeah, Eric, good afternoon. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=9.32s)]
*  You'll be able to hear behind me the Israeli airstrikes that are targeting the eastern [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=10.6s)]
*  side of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=15.16s)]
*  It appears that the Israelis are trying to hit a tunnel system beneath Gaza. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=16.56s)]
*  They've been hitting one specific location over and over and over again, this as they're [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=21.36s)]
*  units on the ground and also tank fire to try and soften the target. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=27.4s)]
*  You mentioned just yesterday we know Israeli forces entered Gaza. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=31.479999999999997s)]
*  They are still operating there tonight in the northern part, trying to destroy as many [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=35.28s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad positions. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=39.56s)]
*  Now, despite this operation, we know that Hamas has maintained their ability to fire [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=41.56s)]
*  rockets just a few minutes ago. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=46.16s)]
*  They were able to target the southern city of Ashkelon earlier today. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=48.16s)]
*  The city of Ashdod took a direct impact. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=52.26s)]
*  Well, tonight, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was speaking alongside [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=55.08s)]
*  his defense minister, Yoav Galant, he spoke about what Israel is facing in the preparations [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=59.019999999999996s)]
*  for the country. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=64.56s)]
*  Netanyahu saying, quote, it's our second war of independence, adding we will win again. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=65.56s)]
*  He was also joined by the defense minister, Yoav Galant, a man that we spoke with face [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=71.47999999999999s)]
*  to face yesterday to understand exactly the objective of the Israelis. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=75.08s)]
*  They say this is now the second phase of the operation. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=79.92s)]
*  The increased airstrikes and ground activity. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=83.1s)]
*  Once again, they are warning civilians inside Gaza to head south. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=85.61999999999999s)]
*  Eric? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=88.94s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, you talk about the tunnel system, of course, perhaps hundreds of miles of tunnels [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=89.94s)]
*  deep underground. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=94.58s)]
*  That the concern? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  Hamas officials say has stockpiled tons of medicine, fuel, food. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=97.25999999999999s)]
*  If you look behind me, Eric, you're going to see some massive air. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=102.1s)]
*  Eric, I want to interrupt you here so you can listen here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=106.94s)]
*  You can hear those strikes and likely see some flashes behind me. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=112.9s)]
*  This is significant. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=116.34s)]
*  It just illustrates the ground is shaking here along the border. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=117.34s)]
*  As the Israelis hammer these positions on the eastern side of Gaza, they're not just [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=122.74s)]
*  softening the target. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=127.34s)]
*  They are reducing it to rubble. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=128.78s)]
*  This has been the situation. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=131.98s)]
*  You could hear those strikes against the eastern side of Gaza. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=133.7s)]
*  And as you mentioned, it's the tunnel system the Israelis are worried about. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=136.66s)]
*  They are concerned that as this war continues and they have forces on the ground, that [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=139.78s)]
*  those forces will be ambushed. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=145.26s)]
*  They will face a severe disadvantage when they're operating inside Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=147.14000000000001s)]
*  And so they want to ensure that they can get rid of any of those tunnels ahead of time [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=151.26s)]
*  before this larger ground incursion moves forward. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=155.62s)]
*  Eric? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=158.58s)]
*  Trey, we're looking at the video right now and we hear the artillery and then you see [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=159.58s)]
*  the flash. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=164.66s)]
*  Do they have specific information that you know of about that tunnel? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=165.82s)]
*  Because as I was saying, it's Hamas have stockpiled medicine, food and everything that the people [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=168.66000000000003s)]
*  of Gaza need. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  But this terrorist organization has kept it for themselves. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=178.74s)]
*  We have been following reports out of Gaza that indicate Hamas is not only holding fuel, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=182.34s)]
*  but also food in the tunnels beneath the strip. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=189.10000000000002s)]
*  And so it's part of the reason that the Israelis have launched what they are calling a complete [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=192.46s)]
*  siege against Gaza. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=195.66000000000003s)]
*  They want to completely cut off the organization, force the fighters and militants to come out [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=197.06s)]
*  of the tunnels and then engage the Israelis face to face. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=202.5s)]
*  But I think the timing of all of this is significant because when we step back and we look at what [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=205.94s)]
*  is unfolding, this is not days or weeks. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  Yesterday, Israel's defense minister, Yoav Galan, telling us it would be months. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=213.26s)]
*  And that was echoed tonight during that press conference and statement where you saw the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=217.56s)]
*  cabinet speaking about the months ahead, trying to deliver a message to the Israeli people [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=223.14s)]
*  and to the world that they will not hold back their strikes. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=228.14s)]
*  They will not hold back their efforts to totally demilitarize the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=231.1s)]
*  They have one specific goal in mind, and that goal is to completely destroy Hamas, to completely [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=234.38s)]
*  demilitarize Gaza so that the border communities and the entire state of Israel can remain [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=241.82s)]
*  safe against future attacks. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=247.94s)]
*  Publicly, officials in the Middle East have criticized Israel for this, but is there a [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=250.46s)]
*  private sense that it's time to be over for Hamas? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=256.18s)]
*  They are protected and feted and supported by not just Iran, but also by Qatar. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=261.02000000000004s)]
*  And Qatar has indicated that after this is over, they will reassess its relationship [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=266.46000000000004s)]
*  to the vile terrorist group. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=271.14s)]
*  Is there a sense that we're at a turning point now for a new change to the Middle East once [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=273.46000000000004s)]
*  this is over, even though it may take several months and who knows how much more bloodshed? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=278.52000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely, Eric. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=284.52000000000004s)]
*  October 7th, the massacre that took place against so many innocent civilians here in [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=287.72s)]
*  southern Israel changed not just Israel, but the entire Middle East forever. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=292.48s)]
*  This country is still in shock. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=297.44s)]
*  It is still reeling from the brutal attack. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=299.04s)]
*  And it's part of the reason that Netanyahu tonight, when he addressed the country and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=302.0s)]
*  the world, said, look, there will be questions that need answers and answers not just from [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=307.32s)]
*  the cabinet, but also from the prime minister himself admitting that because there was clearly [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=313.44s)]
*  a security failure here. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=318.64s)]
*  But when it comes to Hamas, the group in control of Gaza, the response right away from the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=320.0s)]
*  Israelis now is to completely destroy Hamas, one of Iran's largest proxies in the region [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=324.84s)]
*  behind the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, and then also ensure that they're not able [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=330.08s)]
*  to reestablish themselves in other parts of the Middle East. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=334.06s)]
*  Now, this is creating some tension. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=336.76s)]
*  As for the Qataris, the Qataris right now are playing a critical role in trying to get [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=338.88s)]
*  the hostages, but we understand 230 of them free from captivity inside Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=343.32s)]
*  And they have been the mediators in all of this, able to get two American citizens and [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=349.88s)]
*  two Israeli citizens out so far. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=354.56s)]
*  But we understand those conversations continue. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=356.82s)]
*  And despite efforts by Hamas to try and spin the information we are receiving out of Gaza, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=359.12s)]
*  despite the strikes that continue, we understand talks are ongoing to try and get those hostages home. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=365.2s)]
*  Eric? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=371.56s)]
*  Trey Yanks, Trey, reporting in indication of the brave and courageous front-line reporting [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=372.56s)]
*  of our reporters here at Fox News. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XHTUO0Voik&t=377.96000000000004s)]
