# 'Squad' member called out for hanging Palestinian flag outside office
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E)
*  So a Fox News alert, a live look in Gaza where overnight Israeli forces confirmed that they've [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=0.0s)]
*  taken full control of the border they share with Gaza. Moments ago the IDF sharing this video [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=4.96s)]
*  showing the rest of 41 as suspects for their involvement in the terrorist activities. Meanwhile [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=10.48s)]
*  protecting the border, an issue we can relate to here at home as a new report reveals the [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=16.0s)]
*  administration may have lost track of nearly 2 million migrants illegally crossing the border. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=21.2s)]
*  The crisis in Israel and the border hidden home for our next two guests, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=26.72s)]
*  GOP Congressman and retired Army Ranger Brian Mass, serving in the Israeli Defense Forces, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=30.880000000000003s)]
*  and GOP Congressman Max Miller is one of just two Jewish GOP members in Congress and they join us [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=36.08s)]
*  now here outside the Capitol. Gentlemen thank you all so much. I just got to get your reaction [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=42.64s)]
*  Congressman of what's happening in Israel and Congress doesn't have their act together [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=48.96s)]
*  just yet to even get the necessary briefings. You know you and I spoke about this briefly before [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=56.4s)]
*  I said one of the most poignant things I heard one of our colleagues Judge Carter made the point [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=61.92s)]
*  earlier last night that if Congress had to declare war not that he's asking for that but if that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=66.56s)]
*  circumstance came about Congress couldn't do that because the House is the only body that can do [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=72.16s)]
*  that and you can't do that without a speaker. That's the gravity the weight of not having a [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=77.28s)]
*  speaker right now in the midst of our greatest ally in the region being attacked, Americans being [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=82.4s)]
*  kidnapped, killed, and a White House that's out to lunch. Congressman you know you represent us [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=87.6s)]
*  here in America but you have family in Israel. How are they holding up? What are you hearing from [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=93.76s)]
*  them on the ground? Lawrence are doing well but when I woke up just a few days ago at around 5 30 [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=99.04s)]
*  a.m. I woke up to absolute horror. I woke up to my cell phone, text messages, pictures, phone calls. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=103.6s)]
*  It's absolutely upsetting. What we're seeing here in the United States is not a true depiction of [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=109.44s)]
*  what is happening in Israel. These individuals are savages. Israel has taken a measured approach [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=114.08s)]
*  since 1948 in its inception as a country and Israel is a country and will forever be the home of the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=120.08s)]
*  Jewish state. I want to be something very clear. Israel needs to take the gloves off. Murder is [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=126.96s)]
*  murder and terrorism is terrorism. Turn the place into a parking lot. I believe Israel is going to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=132.24s)]
*  get a lot bigger after this conflict as opposed to smaller. Congressman as this is going on and I [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=137.28s)]
*  know Congressman you have a resolution that you're going to introduce but as this is going on your [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=144.72s)]
*  colleague Rashida Tlaib is with quite pride displaying the Palestinian flag outside of her office. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=150.24s)]
*  How does something like this happen? They're Arab Nazis. That's what the Palestinians are. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=159.52s)]
*  They live alongside Jews not for the purpose of living alongside them in peace but living alongside [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=164.08s)]
*  them just long enough to plan can I kidnap children, can I execute the elderly, can I [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=168.88s)]
*  execute the innocent. Not say military to military but target civilians specifically. They should be [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=174.56s)]
*  looked at no differently than that and they might as well put a swastika in the middle of the the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  black and the red and the green and that's essentially what she's displaying. And by the way [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  you saw in the protest as they were literally celebrating the deaths of Israeli bodies and by [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=188.64s)]
*  the way Israeli bodies let's clarify something. Israel is a country that harbors every religion [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=193.51999999999998s)]
*  of every denomination. It is not only Jewish blood that these individuals are spilling. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  They are spilling Christian blood. They are spilling Hindu blood. They are spilling their [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=204.0s)]
*  own brothers and sisters blood when it comes to the Muslim and Islam. That's what they want. When [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=207.76s)]
*  they say river to the sea Lawrence they want all of Israel. They don't want peace. We've taken the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  measure to approach since 1948. I hope Israel does what Israel needs to do. They can take the advice [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=218.32s)]
*  that they would like from any country around the world including the United States but they need to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=223.84s)]
*  do what's best to protect themselves and it is my hope that this body behind me and my great [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=227.92s)]
*  colleague to my left and our Democrat friends and the President Biden down the street will continue [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  to support our greatest Democratic ally in Israel because we need them just as much as they need us. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  Congressman they have American hostages right now. Are we going to wait until Kayla Mueller's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=244.24s)]
*  situation to go rescue our people? It doesn't seem like there's been any response from the [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=250.72s)]
*  Biden administration on that. You do have the Ford Carrier Battle Group that's over there. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=256.64s)]
*  We do have a tremendous infrastructure of U.S. and American intelligence sharing cross-training [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=260.56s)]
*  capabilities things that have happened over the years outside of the fact that Congress is in a [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=266.08s)]
*  bit of disarray right now. That infrastructure being in place helps that situation and I've [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=269.92s)]
*  said this before. Any American should expect that Americans come to rescue American hostages. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=275.04s)]
*  I want to get to this Congressman. Suspicions surrounding the admins ex-Iran envoy after [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=280.40000000000003s)]
*  Israel attack. Last month leaked files revealed that Rob Mayley's aid were tied to secretive [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=285.6s)]
*  Iranian influence operation. Congressman this special envoy what are y'all learning about this? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=290.64s)]
*  I mean right off the top of your head. Yeah so I've asked both behind closed doors and in public [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  hearings about Robert Malley. State Department gives us no information on on Malley why his [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=304.64s)]
*  departure why his security clearance has been revoked. We do know that there is staff that [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=309.28000000000003s)]
*  has been accused of working on Iranian information campaigns. Again asked publicly very specifically [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=314.72s)]
*  you can go back and look at hearings. Why don't you tell us about this individual's SF-86 their [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  national security questionnaire. What did they answer in there in terms of their relationship [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=325.52s)]
*  with foreign government connections because the report is is that that individual reported [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=330.88s)]
*  directly to the Iranian foreign minister. If that wasn't reported I'll give you one other quick [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=336.08s)]
*  point on this. The statute of limitations to report that on your national security questionnaire [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=340.64s)]
*  is seven years and the timeline looks like that person may have just been hired on by the federal [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=345.2s)]
*  government right at that seven-year departure mark. So these are questions that exist. This is [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=350.64s)]
*  unbelievable. We're going to be digging into that real quickly though Congressman Miller. The [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=354.72s)]
*  speaker's race I know you had a closed door meeting yesterday to air some grievances out there. What [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=358.8s)]
*  do we expect to see now that y'all have had that closed door meeting? Yeah look we had a great [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=364.0s)]
*  conversation last night and we always say democracy is ugly and it is and you know this is what [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=369.6s)]
*  Republicans like to do. We like to give positions and award them based off merit and not based off [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=374.32000000000005s)]
*  who's next in line and that's what the Democrat party does. That's why they're always such a mess. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=379.20000000000005s)]
*  What I want to see is to take the appropriate amount of time to pick the right speaker and [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=383.76s)]
*  the right leadership that goes along with that team. Look we just have whiplash from one of our [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=388.32s)]
*  colleagues and eight of them upending everything. So we need to focus. I believe we'll select a [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=392.71999999999997s)]
*  speaker and I believe it'll be Jim Jordan to take us to those new heights. Thank you so much and [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  Congressman who are you going for? He says Jim Jordan. Look I'm supporting Jim Jordan in this race [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=401.84s)]
*  but we have a candidate for him. We want to hear those candidates out. Everybody should come with [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=407.2s)]
*  an open mind. Congressman thank you so much for your service. Congressman we're praying for your [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=411.28s)]
*  family back in Israel and we appreciate y'all coming on this morning. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eknkitA8n9E&t=414.88s)]
