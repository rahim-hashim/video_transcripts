# Comms attacks on Hezbollah first time a terror group has been terrorized by nation state: Navy SEAL
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c)
*  Well, Eric, Israel's attacks on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon this week raising fears [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=0.0s)]
*  of a wider war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=6.78s)]
*  In fact, here's National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan earlier today. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=8.1s)]
*  It has been since October 7. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=16.6s)]
*  There are moments where it is more acute than others. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=19.02s)]
*  I think we are in one of those moments where it is more acute. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=21.66s)]
*  He says the risk of escalation is real. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=26.9s)]
*  OK, let's bring in Mike Cirelli. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=30.299999999999997s)]
*  He's a retired Navy SEAL officer. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=33.379999999999995s)]
*  First of all, Mike, if I could, I want to get your reaction to rigging pagers and walkie [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=35.62s)]
*  talkies as explosives. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=40.739999999999995s)]
*  And this, is this a game changer? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=42.54s)]
*  If so, how so? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=44.7s)]
*  You've got to look at it from this point of perspective. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=47.78s)]
*  This is the first time that a terrorist organization has been terrorized by a nation state. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=49.94s)]
*  I mean, it's a master class by the Mossad in Israel in their ability to sort of get [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=55.66s)]
*  into the supply chain system that Hezbollah was using for their communications, rig them [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=62.44s)]
*  with explosives. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=67.82s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=68.82s)]
*  There isn't a Hezbollah operative or soldier that won't think twice about using an electronic [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=70.3s)]
*  device, which means they're now in their thought process. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=75.82s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=79.54s)]
*  Can terrorists use this tactic or is the operation too sophisticated for them? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=80.54s)]
*  No, it's not. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=86.34s)]
*  They have the capability. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=87.34s)]
*  But you've got to remember that Israel is a nation of startups. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=88.34s)]
*  They're extremely technologically advanced. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=90.86000000000001s)]
*  But what we're also seeing is the what we call the preparation of the battle space with [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=93.42s)]
*  60,000 Israelis displaced from northern Israel. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=98.46000000000001s)]
*  Israel is systematically preparing the battlefield if an invasion is ultimately decided upon. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=103.1s)]
*  But they're hitting command and control nodes. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=109.53999999999999s)]
*  We saw that with the removal of a kill. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=112.86s)]
*  And you've got to believe that they're going to take a shot if they get Nasrallah in their [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=115.3s)]
*  sites or have actionable intelligence. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=119.1s)]
*  They'll take that opportunity. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=120.89999999999999s)]
*  But they're also hitting, you know, ammo depots, the rocket sites, if an invasion is agreed [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=122.32s)]
*  upon by Netanyahu. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=130.5s)]
*  Now, that's Hezbollah we're talking about. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=131.29999999999998s)]
*  But of course, Hamas is definitely still hard at work. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=134.01999999999998s)]
*  So what I want to do in a bad way, of course, here's a side by side look at Hezbollah and [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=137.1s)]
*  Hamas, Mike. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=143.26s)]
*  Hezbollah has 100,000 fighters with Hamas, with some nine to 12,000 fighters. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=144.98s)]
*  Hezbollah has 150,000 firepower, which Hamas has 30,000 rockets and missiles. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=152.86s)]
*  But when you look at the annual revenue, all right, Hezbollah with 700 million and Hamas [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=161.22000000000003s)]
*  is raking in over one billion dollars each year. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=168.54000000000002s)]
*  So first of all, where and how does Hamas get its money and how does that money impact [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=172.86s)]
*  the Hamas war against Israel? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=179.24s)]
*  Iran is ultimately the epicenter here for the Shia militias. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=183.02s)]
*  And Hezbollah is a much stronger militia than Hamas at this point. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=187.86s)]
*  Hamas has been degraded to the point where Israel feels that they can maneuver resources [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=191.06s)]
*  to northern Israel to deal with the imminent threat that they're posed with there. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=196.06s)]
*  But ultimately, Iran, and you've got to remember, Iran is in a dicey situation. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=200.66000000000003s)]
*  The Ayatollah is always one bad protest or uprising from an internal event. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=206.14s)]
*  Ultimately, Russia and China are involved in the decision making process for Iran. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=211.73999999999998s)]
*  And of course, you know, they're pushing Iran to continue whatever disruption they can gain [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=217.42s)]
*  in the region as it aids Russia with Ukraine and then China's expansion in Asia. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=222.42s)]
*  And not to get off track here, but you said emphatically that Russia and China are basically [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=229.82s)]
*  directing Iran in its operation, its terrorist operation. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=236.73999999999998s)]
*  Why is the U.S. still doing business with China? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=241.42s)]
*  How does China get to remain sort of an upstanding nation on a level on the world stage? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=243.9s)]
*  We've become so dependent on China as an economic peer. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=252.78s)]
*  They are also a military near peer competitor. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=257.18s)]
*  I think until we can maneuver or move manufacturing to the U.S. at the rate that China has, we're [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=260.86s)]
*  going to continue to be dependent on them, which sort of forces us to the economic, let's [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=266.90000000000003s)]
*  say, negotiation table in dealing with them into the future. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=271.42s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=276.62s)]
*  We have more than that, but we don't have time. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=277.62s)]
*  How much time do I have, guys? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=280.98s)]
*  Do I have time for a couple more or do I have to say goodbye? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=281.98s)]
*  All right. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=284.42s)]
*  I have about a minute. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=285.42s)]
*  What I'd like to do is, you know, we talked about Hezbollah and you said that they're [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=286.46000000000004s)]
*  strong. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=292.78000000000003s)]
*  I want to know what are the implications of this war unfolding on Lebanon's soil? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=293.78000000000003s)]
*  So the impetus behind the espionage through the Pagers in the two-way radios was brought [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=301.58000000000004s)]
*  on by a plan called the Conquest of Galilee. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=309.14s)]
*  This was an October 7th style attack planned by Hezbollah on the soil of Israel. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=312.86s)]
*  So Israel was really forced to deal with Hezbollah. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=319.38s)]
*  And now, as you see, they're moving their forces into northern Israel in preparation [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=324.02s)]
*  for an invasion, if that's called for. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=329.08s)]
*  So Israel was could ill afford another October 7th attack. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=331.65999999999997s)]
*  The Netanyahu regime could ill afford another October 7th attack. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=336.34s)]
*  And they were forced to deal with this problem on a grander scale at this time. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=341.1s)]
*  OK. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=345.78000000000003s)]
*  Again, more questions, not enough time at the moment. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=346.78000000000003s)]
*  But we'll have you back again, Mike Cirelli. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=351.26000000000005s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=353.82000000000005s)]
*  Thanks, Hotho. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=355.66s)]
*  on YouTube. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a4XiQAX8_8c&t=371.1s)]
