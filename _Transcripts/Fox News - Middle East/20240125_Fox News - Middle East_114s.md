*  provided no evidence to support [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=44.0s)]

*  the next two days. The U. S. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=60.96s)]
*  presence in Iraq. Currently [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=62.96s)]
*  there are around 2500 American [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=64.96000000000001s)]

*  with the war between Israel and [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=78.48s)]
*  Hamas at day 111. There are no [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=80.88s)]
*  signs that conflict will be [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=82.48s)]
*  dying down anytime soon, and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=84.32s)]
*  thus the attacks against [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=85.68s)]
*  Israel are a risk for the [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=87.28s)]
*  U. S. Navy. The U. S. Navy is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=89.12s)]

*  Aden in the next two days. There [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=92.56s)]
*  is a risk of dragging the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=94.48s)]
*  entire region into a broader [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RqHounTlD4&t=96.24000000000001s)]
