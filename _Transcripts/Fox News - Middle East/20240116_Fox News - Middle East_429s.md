# 'DESPICABLE': Cancer center targeted by anti-Israel protesters
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0)
*  Iran is on the move against us. Yesterday, Iranian Revolutionary Guard actually fired [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=0.0s)]
*  missiles into northern Iraq not far from the U.S. consulate. And Iran is using its paid [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=9.68s)]
*  buddies, terrorists, to attack our forces too. Houthi killers hit a U.S.-owned ship [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=15.68s)]
*  off the coast of Yemen. Those strikes may have been in retaliation for some moves that [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=23.12s)]
*  were finally making. The U.S. and the U.K. hit more than 60 Houthi targets last week. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=29.54s)]
*  We also learned that the U.S. Navy seized Iranian-made weapons last week. The arms were [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=35.96s)]
*  headed to Houthi fighters in Yemen. Bloodthirsty terrorists. Those same people, here too will [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=41.42s)]
*  be called savages, have attacked dozens of commercial ships in the Red Sea over the last [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=50.739999999999995s)]
*  couple of months. And Iran-backed terrorists have also targeted U.S. forces in the Middle [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=55.86s)]
*  East at least 137 times since October 17th. General Jack Keene with this. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=60.66s)]
*  Iran doesn't care how many rockets and missiles we destroy in Yemen. They will just give them [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=68.06s)]
*  more. Iran further doesn't care how many of the Houthi rebels we kill because they know [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=75.3s)]
*  they're a radicalized group and they'll get new members. They are the center of gravity. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=82.96000000000001s)]
*  We've got to organize ourselves to go against them. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=87.80000000000001s)]
*  And there's a cloud over all this instability and danger. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=91.68s)]
*  just back home from his two-week hospital stint after surgery the week before that apparently [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=97.30000000000001s)]
*  didn't go well, or at least as anticipated. And along the lines, a lot of controversy [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=102.64s)]
*  since the White House didn't even know where he was for three days. The Pentagon says [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=109.08s)]
*  Secretary Austin will work from home for the time being, doctors orders. And breaking news [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=113.56s)]
*  just now, Fox has learned that just today the United States hit and destroyed four Iran-provided [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=119.16s)]
*  Houthi anti-ship ballistic missiles in Yemen. Steve Hilton, Fox News contributor. Steve, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=127.44s)]
*  first your reaction to that breaking news. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=133.51999999999998s)]
*  Too little too late. And that's why people are so terrified now about an escalation. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=137.48000000000002s)]
*  The weakness of the Biden administration has invited this escalation. So we can look at [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=143.88000000000002s)]
*  the shambles surrounding Lloyd Austin and talk about that personal aspect of it. That [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=150.4s)]
*  itself projects a message of weakness. But as so often with this administration, it's [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  not actually just the incompetence. This is a matter of deliberate policy design. It [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=161.6s)]
*  goes right back to the beginning of this administration. They have had a policy of appeasement. That's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=166.88s)]
*  actually what it is. Because they believe, sincerely it seems, that if you are nice to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=173.88s)]
*  bad guys, then they'll suddenly become good. But exactly the opposite has happened. And [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=179.64s)]
*  you see it time and time again. And so what you've seen is the collapse of U.S. deterrence [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=184.95999999999998s)]
*  that was built up with President Trump. And you saw it with Putin, where they dropped [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=190.24s)]
*  the sanctions on Nord Stream, hoping that that would appease him. Didn't work. You got [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=195.12s)]
*  exactly the opposite result. You saw it with Afghanistan. You see it with Iran, where they've [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=198.56s)]
*  just been desperate from day one to get back into that nuclear deal. And so the message [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=202.60000000000002s)]
*  that goes around the world is that we don't trust America to really deter aggression. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=207.48000000000002s)]
*  They've actually got a name for it. The Biden administration bragged about it. They call [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=214.32000000000002s)]
*  integrated deterrence. They said, we no longer need... What does that even mean? I know. Integrated [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=219.04s)]
*  deterrence. What they meant by that, it seems, is that we're going to use technology and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=224.72s)]
*  we no longer need to rely on our military so much to deter bad guys. Well, look at the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  result. A more dangerous and chaotic world. Wow. Integrated deterrence. Axios is reporting [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=233.84s)]
*  that President Biden is running out of patience with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=240.95999999999998s)]
*  But he'll hit this target. The two haven't spoken in three and a half weeks. The last [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=246.8s)]
*  call reportedly ended with frustration. Biden's saying, this conversation is over. And there [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=253.04000000000002s)]
*  it is. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=259.12s)]
*  You support genocide! You support genocide! [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=260.12s)]
*  And take a look at this. The anti-Israel protesting in our nation, far from over. A massive group [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=268.32s)]
*  in New York City marched to multiple hospitals, including a large cancer center. They were [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=273.96s)]
*  chanting shame and complicity and genocide. The group's organizers say they targeted the [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=279.56s)]
*  hospitals because they take in donations from Jewish billionaires. One witness, a 74-year-old [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=284.96s)]
*  Jewish man expressing horror over the scene, saying he felt like he was in 1939 Germany. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=291.0s)]
*  Steve? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=296.2s)]
*  I mean, it is just unbelievable, isn't it? It's so despicable. I mean, you could sort [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=297.2s)]
*  of joke about it and say sometimes when you look at the antics of these pro-Palestinian [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  demonstrators, it's almost as if they're a Psyop or some kind of secret operation from [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=306.32s)]
*  Mossad sent to undermine the Palestinian cause in the eyes of normal, decent people who look [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=310.4s)]
*  at this stuff and think, where are your hearts? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=317.14s)]
*  I mean, remember, this is the same kind of attitude we saw right at the beginning of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=320.32s)]
*  this, when we just couldn't believe our eyes as we saw people ripping down those posters [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=325.28s)]
*  on the streets, including of hostages who were children and babies. It's the same kind [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=331.18s)]
*  of mentality. And as to the broader point about Biden, it's incredible, isn't it, how [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=335.76s)]
*  quickly we and it seems the political system on the Democratic side just forgets about [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  the absolute horror and atrocity of October 7th. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=347.58s)]
*  Oh, I don't think they forgot. I think they see that there's a far left section of their [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=349.86s)]
*  party that won't vote for him because they're telling him Rashida Tlaib is letting them [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=354.5s)]
*  know. He knows he's got to capitulate. Otherwise, he won't just lose the black vote. He's going [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=359.1s)]
*  to lose the Muslim vote, too. And the game is on. So, yeah, it's sad all around because [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=363.5s)]
*  his policies don't help the situation on the ground in Israel anyway. They're going back [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=370.06s)]
*  and forth right now. Exactly. It's exactly what you say, though, that the hate is driving [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=374.32s)]
*  those. Those people in the streets, if they really wanted to help the Palestinians, this [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=379.62s)]
*  is not how you would do it. You would find a way to get some money to them and ask these [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=383.1s)]
*  other Arab nations to take more of them in. That's right. I mean, look, by the way, to [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=389.02s)]
*  that point, look, what's going on with the other Arab nations, that massive fortified [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=392.85999999999996s)]
*  border wall that they're building to keep the Palestinians out. Where is the solidarity? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=397.38s)]
*  You know, it's exactly right. There's so much more that could be done than this despicable [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=402.85999999999996s)]
*  attack basically on anyone who's associated with the state of Israel or Jewishness. It's [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=409.41999999999996s)]
*  unbelievable. Steve Hilton in focus. Thank you. Thank you, Harris. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dhonfKUh_u0&t=414.38s)]
