# KJP sparks outrage with word salad after attempting to honor fallen soldiers
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA)
*  We now know the names of the three Army soldiers killed in the deadly attack carried out by [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=0.0s)]
*  Iranian proxy fighters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=5.2s)]
*  Sergeant William Rivers, Specialist Kennedy Sanders, and Specialist Brianna Moffitt. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=7.28s)]
*  They were all assigned to the 718th Engineer Company. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=11.78s)]
*  That is an Army Reserve unit based out of Georgia. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=15.14s)]
*  But the White House sparking outrage after this response while trying to offer condolences. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=18.3s)]
*  Our deepest, obviously our deepest condolences go out and our heartfelt condolences go out [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=25.3s)]
*  to the families who lost three brave, three brave folks who are military folks who are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=31.3s)]
*  brave who are always fighting, who are fighting on behalf of this administration of the American [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=40.46s)]
*  people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  Florida Congressman Cory Mills is an Iraq War veteran and he joins us now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  What's worse, the fact that after two years, Corrine Jean-Pierre still can't get out a [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=52.9s)]
*  simple message, much less a message of condolences, which is quite frankly the easiest thing you [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=57.54s)]
*  can do. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=63.06s)]
*  We can all do that. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=64.06s)]
*  We all have done it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=65.06s)]
*  Or the fact that she thinks the military, the brave men and women who fight and die, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=66.06s)]
*  do it for the administration and not the American people. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=71.34s)]
*  Well both things are extremely disappointing. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=76.5s)]
*  It's easy to offer our condolences to our brave heroes who fought and served in our [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  armed forces and proudly served the United States of America and the United States citizens. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=84.17999999999999s)]
*  I mean look, it's very simple. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=89.82s)]
*  We swear an oath. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=91.66s)]
*  We don't swear it to an administration. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=92.66s)]
*  We swear to support and defend our constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=93.94s)]
*  And that's protecting our way of life and our native and our rights. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=99.33999999999999s)]
*  So I'm not surprised that she wouldn't even have a simple message. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  I'm not surprised that she thinks that our military is there to serve this administration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=105.88s)]
*  It's kind of maligned ways, but it's really disappointing that she can't do something [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=109.64s)]
*  so simple as just honoring our fallen heroes. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=113.76s)]
*  It's quite a slip because it really does Freudian almost give an insight into the way they think. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=117.08s)]
*  And they think the apparatus of government is there for them and for their means and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  not for the underlying country. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=129.72s)]
*  And that is wholly concerning. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=131.2s)]
*  To the larger issue, Congressman, the longer Joe Biden waits, the worse and the weaker [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=132.9s)]
*  the United States look. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=138.3s)]
*  What should Joe Biden have done immediately upon learning of the death of those three [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=139.9s)]
*  brave individuals? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=145.1s)]
*  Well, you know, this is one of those rare situations that I don't know that an immediate [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=146.1s)]
*  retaliatory strike is exactly what's needed. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  We're not here to play a tit for tat game with Iran on their terms. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=154.14000000000001s)]
*  But I also would argue that if we haven't done the proper analysis to determine why [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=158.18s)]
*  we weren't able to stop this attack drone from impacting one of our outposts in Jordan, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=162.96s)]
*  then I think a retaliatory strike that would potentially put our soldiers at further risk [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=168.06s)]
*  wouldn't be the adequate response. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=172.68s)]
*  We also have to bear in mind, Todd, not all of our responses needs to be equal kinetic. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=174.46s)]
*  We could also look at the non-kinetic elements of further economic sanctions. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=179.68s)]
*  dollars in fungible income that Joe Biden has provided, which is funding these types [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=185.26s)]
*  of attacks, stop the actual increase in oil exportation that is being refined in China [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=190.45999999999998s)]
*  and start actually putting back the Trump policies that sanctioned and nearly crippled [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=196.1s)]
*  all of Iran. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=200.45999999999998s)]
*  And so while I agree that we should have an equal and a very, very direct response, we [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=201.7s)]
*  must ensure the safety of our troops first and not get into a tit for tat where our soldiers [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=207.34s)]
*  are playing catch with missiles, rockets and these attack drones. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=211.98s)]
*  Understood. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=215.57999999999998s)]
*  Finally, an Israeli dossier is alleging that 190 United Nations employees have ties to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  Hamas and they claim 12 were directly involved in Hamas terror attacks on October 7th. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=224.42s)]
*  These people are accused of kidnapping, violence, providing ammunition to Hamas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  There are the 12 up on your screen. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  And yet Joe Biden has given their organizations the United Nations Relief and Works Agency [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=236.82s)]
*  UNRWA one billion dollars after Trump cut its funding. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=241.9s)]
*  Final thoughts on that, Congressman. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=247.5s)]
*  Well the bottom line is that what the United Nations used to stand for isn't what they [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=250.62s)]
*  stand for today. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=254.06s)]
*  It's useless nations. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=255.14s)]
*  It's the same as NATO that was put in 1947 to try and go ahead and prevent Soviet Union [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=256.5s)]
*  expansionism. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=261.78s)]
*  And now that just stands for now America takes over. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=262.78s)]
*  But for too long America has continued to foot the bill whether it be through our treasures, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=265.44s)]
*  whether it be through our soldiers that we put on harm's way. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=269.71999999999997s)]
*  We need to actually look at what Senator Mike Lee said by removing ourselves from the UN [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=272.56s)]
*  if they're not going to actually do their job because we're not here to support the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=276.64s)]
*  very terrorism that threatens the American lives. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=279.48s)]
*  It does beg the question, 20 seconds, what is the role of the UN anymore, Congressman? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=282.06s)]
*  Well I think that's something that we all need to define. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  I refer to it now as useless nations or you know NATO as now America takes over. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=291.2s)]
*  We have to try and get back to what they originally did. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=295.88s)]
*  If not, stop taxpayer funding from going into it and let us go ahead and take care of things [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=298.4s)]
*  at home. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=302.82s)]
*  It seems like the role of the United Nations seems to get the people who go to the United [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=303.82s)]
*  Nations, the elite that make it up, richer and richer. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=309.4s)]
*  And that doesn't make sense. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=312.7s)]
*  The United Nations is designed to... [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  Well not to mention that that was actually some of the concrete that was supported and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  some of the actual billions of dollars that went in to help Palestine was used for the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=319.09999999999997s)]
*  terror tunnels. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=322.34s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=323.34s)]
*  Unreal. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=324.34s)]
*  Gotta leave it there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=325.34s)]
*  Congressman Cory Mills, thank you Fox and Friends right now. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z2nwgImrQRA&t=326.34s)]
