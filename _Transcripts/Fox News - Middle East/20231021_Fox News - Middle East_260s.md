# US ship shoots down 15 drones, 4 Israel-bound missiles
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 21, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps)
*  As unrest rises in the Middle East, the Pentagon reveals a U.S. naval destroyer took missiles [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=0.0s)]
*  heading to Israel. The USS Carney was in Egypt's Suez Canal when it took out the barrage of enemy [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=6.32s)]
*  fire in a span of just nine hours. Kirk Leipold is the former Navy commander of the USS Cole, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=12.88s)]
*  and he joins us now. Commander, thank you so much for joining us. I was trying to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=20.0s)]
*  figure this out before you came on. Do you know, is USS Carney a part of the 26th Mew that was just [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=24.96s)]
*  brought up through the canal? That I don't know if it is or not. Typically if a destroyer is [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=29.92s)]
*  assigned to a Mew, they tend to stay close by simply because they want to be able to protect [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=36.64s)]
*  that force. Tell us what this looks like. We're talking about drones, which is relatively new [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  technology, but it's an aircraft that has the capability to hurt or destroy something. They [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=45.68s)]
*  sometimes aren't flying very fast. What type of weapons capabilities does a destroyer have to [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=50.32000000000001s)]
*  combat these new technologies? Well, with the technologies, the Aegis weapons system, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=55.36s)]
*  specifically the spy radar, which the Carney has, which is the same as my ship USS Cole had, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=60.72s)]
*  is designed to be able to pick up these small targets. And then you have a variety of weapons. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  They could have used anything from a five inch gun, which is probably the most likely. It's doubtful [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=71.84s)]
*  they would use surface to air missiles, but if it got in close, they could even use the 20 millimeter [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=77.44s)]
*  close in weapons system. When we see this, you know, the report is there was 15 drones, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=82.24s)]
*  four cruise missiles. The report doesn't seem to suggest they were fired at the ship or even [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=87.67999999999999s)]
*  the fleet, the U.S. fleet, but possibly in Israel. But is this considered a direct U.S. engagement? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=92.64s)]
*  Do we need to look at this and say, hey, the United States is at war? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=99.44s)]
*  I wouldn't say that, Joey. I think at this point, thankfully, first and foremost is commend the crew [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=103.03999999999999s)]
*  of the USS Carney for the great job in intercepting those four missiles and those 15 drones. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=108.16s)]
*  The fact that it came in over a period of time, clearly that ship and the commanding officer was [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=113.75999999999999s)]
*  given the rules of engagement necessary to ensure it. The other thing is when missiles are coming [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=119.2s)]
*  towards you, you don't want to sit and say, geez, we don't know where they're going. Let's hesitate [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  wait. And at the last minute, suddenly that missile picked you up as the radar target instead of its [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=129.6s)]
*  ultimate target and decides to change course. And you have to be in a very reactive mode. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=134.4s)]
*  The fact that Carney was proactive in doing this, saw them, detected them and engaged them really [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=139.12s)]
*  is a credit to the training of the crew and how well they've done it. Yeah. The rules of engagement [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  is such a good point because we don't know what we don't know what our involvement is going to look [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=148.96s)]
*  like, what orders have been brought down to the chain of command as far as supporting the Israeli [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=153.12s)]
*  defense force in their active offensive operations. But when we look at the totality of U.S. forces [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=158.72s)]
*  that will be essentially off the coast of Israel, we're talking about two destroyer or two aircraft [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  carrier groups and as well as this Mew, smaller ships, but a lot of capabilities. When we bring [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=169.12s)]
*  that contingent together, United States military off the coast of Israel or off the coast there, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  is there a more capable contingent of military anywhere in the world than what we have right [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=182.0s)]
*  there at that moment? Actually, no, Joey. And that's one of the great things is having those [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=188.72s)]
*  two aircraft carrier strike groups off the coast really serves as a deterrent and stabilizing force. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=194.0s)]
*  It allows us to be able to tell first and foremost, Iran, that if you push and if you engage with all [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=200.64s)]
*  your other proxy forces and they take a shot at Israel or they begin to engage on multiple fronts [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=208.24s)]
*  or if they engage U.S. naval forces, then we reserve the right first and foremost for self-defense, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=213.68s)]
*  then if necessary to project power as necessary to protect the United States national security [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=219.76s)]
*  interests and then do that in coordination with what Israel is doing as they prepare for the ground [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=225.28s)]
*  invasion into Gaza. Your expertise is unmatched. We really, really enjoy having you on because these [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  are questions that a lot of Americans don't know. Our Navy is something to be so proud of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=235.92s)]
*  and it's so great to hear, unfortunately, a success story in time of war. Thank you so much for your [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=240.32s)]
*  service. Thanks for joining us. Thank you, Joey. Yes, sir. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCL9RTIl4Ps&t=245.6s)]
