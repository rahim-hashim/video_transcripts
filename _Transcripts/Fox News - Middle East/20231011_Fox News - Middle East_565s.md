# Sirens blare in central Israel as Hamas rockets target Tel Aviv
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo)
*  Trey Yankst has been living, has been live along the Israeli Gaza border all morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=0.0s)]
*  He was in a car for a while, now he's back. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=4.8s)]
*  Hey Trey, we're hearing a lot of explosions behind you, and we're seeing a lot of aerial [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=6.8s)]
*  shots of explosions in Gaza. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=10.8s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=14.0s)]
*  The explosions behind me are from outgoing artillery units that are striking the eastern [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=16.88s)]
*  side of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=21.54s)]
*  Still Gaza's getting hit from the air, from the ground and the sea. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=23.44s)]
*  The Israeli Navy shelling the beaches. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=26.6s)]
*  This is a full on siege. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=28.96s)]
*  And you heard from the spokesman from the Israeli military earlier in the show talking [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=30.36s)]
*  about what got us here, this massacre of civilians. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=35.4s)]
*  And there's a real expectation that the ground war that is about to take place will last [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=39.24s)]
*  for a very, very long time. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=43.92s)]
*  I want to show you what the artillery units look like behind me. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=45.88s)]
*  They've been firing off all day, hitting those positions inside Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=48.84s)]
*  There's an effort to clear a path for the Israeli military before they actually enter [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=53.16s)]
*  the Strip. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=57.400000000000006s)]
*  It's going to be an incredibly difficult operation with guerrilla warfare tactics against them. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=58.44s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad have been able to smuggle weapons into Gaza through tunnels [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=64.24s)]
*  on the Egyptian border for years. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=68.92s)]
*  Since the mid 2000s, when Hamas ultimately took over Gaza in 2006, they were able to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=72.28s)]
*  build this network of tunnels where they're actually, they say, holding the hostages, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=79.8s)]
*  The Americans, the Israelis, anyone that they took from southern Israel back into Gaza, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=84.76s)]
*  Hamas claims they're taking them into the tunnels. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=89.2s)]
*  This is especially problematic for the Israelis because they're launching airstrikes against [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=91.84s)]
*  the infrastructure that holds the weapons from these Iranian back groups. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=96.08s)]
*  So when we talk about what this situation is going to look like, it is not going to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=100.72s)]
*  be one of the traditional events that you see here in this region when it comes to Israel [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=104.2s)]
*  and Gaza. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=108.92s)]
*  Many times we've covered three and four day operations. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=109.92s)]
*  There was an 11 day war between Israel and Gaza and even a 51 day war back in 2014. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=114.0s)]
*  There's an understanding this is different. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=119.76s)]
*  This is a matter of life and death for Israel. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=122.24s)]
*  And this is something that will not be over in a short period of time. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=126.32s)]
*  That's what we're told from the military and based on what we see on the ground, not just [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=129.96s)]
*  from these artillery units, but from the soldiers and from the many people that we've spoken [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=133.24s)]
*  with, this is the sense that we get on the ground. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=138.12s)]
*  Yeah, Lawrence. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=140.68s)]
*  Trey, you know, I know you're plugged in and you have sources with inside of the military. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=142.68s)]
*  I know the ground troops are waiting to go in from that order from the prime minister. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=147.56s)]
*  What is the calculation? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=152.76000000000002s)]
*  What is the weight right now for those ground troops? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  The Israelis have strategic patience on their hands and I'm going to have my cameraman pan [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=161.88s)]
*  over to this middle unit right here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=167.28s)]
*  And you're probably going to see some more artillery come off just over those tree tops [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=169.4s)]
*  there. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=174.24s)]
*  The idea for Israel right now is to wait and to be strategic. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=175.68s)]
*  They don't have to rush into Gaza. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  They can take their time moving as many forces here because this is not a simple operation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=181.8s)]
*  It does not mean that there is not an urgency in the Israeli military because of the hostages [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=188.32000000000002s)]
*  that were taken, but there is an understanding based on their intelligence and what we know [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  about the tunnel network inside Gaza that it's not going to be something simple. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=196.82000000000002s)]
*  They cannot just go in and rescue these people. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=201.26000000000002s)]
*  They're going to need to take territory and they have to do that in an efficient way and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=203.78s)]
*  in a way that doesn't get the first initial units killed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=208.18s)]
*  And so they're going to be up against roadside bombs, RPGs, small arms fire, a civilian population [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=211.42000000000002s)]
*  that hates them in many cases, and a militant organization that runs the strip, Hamas, with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=216.94s)]
*  smaller factions like Islamic Jihad, PFLP, all of these organizations that build rockets, [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=223.18s)]
*  they can build weapons, and we have seen with our cameras that they can build bombs. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=229.62s)]
*  And so that's what Israel needs the time to prepare for. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=234.46s)]
*  Surely. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=237.54000000000002s)]
*  And Trey, I was just reading thousands of Israelis have volunteered to dig graves, which [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=238.54000000000002s)]
*  is speaks volumes about what is happening there. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=245.3s)]
*  But many funerals near the border with Gaza where you are can't be held because of the [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=248.74s)]
*  military action that we are seeing behind you and we are hearing. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=252.85999999999999s)]
*  You mentioned in the last hour that you have been in contact with Hamas. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=257.78s)]
*  What do they say? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=265.3s)]
*  How's it going for them right now? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=266.3s)]
*  Overhead, you can hear an Israeli fighter jet going back and forth. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=270.1s)]
*  We're right here along the border and they're still striking targets inside Gaza. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=274.98s)]
*  I did speak with a Hamas official and I spoke with him again today. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=279.14000000000004s)]
*  And this is someone that I have known for a very long time, a source of mine from my [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=283.06s)]
*  reporting inside Gaza who generally answers questions that I ask. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  He's been avoiding questions about the civilian massacre that took place here on Saturday [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=291.82000000000005s)]
*  morning saying things like the land will not be taken from the Palestinians and also saying [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=296.14000000000004s)]
*  things like the situation is very difficult for them inside. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=301.62s)]
*  So it's a lot of propaganda from Hamas. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=306.56s)]
*  It's not a lot of solid information about what's truly happening inside. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=309.52s)]
*  Although we do know according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, more than a thousand people [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=313.24s)]
*  are dead inside Gaza. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=317.2s)]
*  I do want to know just one other thing. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=318.68s)]
*  Trey, sorry to interrupt you but apparently our producers are telling us there's sirens [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=320.92s)]
*  going off in central Israel. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=324.68s)]
*  They said central part of Israel. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=327.12s)]
*  Let me look at the name for you. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=334.68s)]
*  We're going to go to our app because when you're in Israel, everyone has an app for [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=335.8s)]
*  red alert sirens and my producer is going to check here too to see where the sirens [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=340.92s)]
*  are sounding now. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=345.36s)]
*  Yeah, so likely the Israelis are under fire from short and medium range rockets. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=347.36s)]
*  This is sort of a constant issue here because both Islamic Jihad and Hamas will fire rockets [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=354.5s)]
*  at different angles and at different barrages in order to try and overwhelm Israel's missile [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=361.5s)]
*  defense system, the Iron Dome. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=366.18s)]
*  Likely what they're trying to do here, some of that fire is going to be picked up by the [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=368.18s)]
*  Iron Dome. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=371.42s)]
*  If it determines that it's not a threat to a populated area, sometimes the Israelis allow [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=372.42s)]
*  the rocket fire through. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=376.46s)]
*  But this is not a perfect system as we have seen. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=378.16s)]
*  Sometimes these are slamming into buildings. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=380.66s)]
*  We saw earlier this week as one in Ashkelon, a city very close to here, slammed into the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=382.8s)]
*  side of a building. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=388.22s)]
*  So it just gives you a sense of what Israel is facing. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=389.22s)]
*  And when that happens, people get an alert on their phones and they have to immediately [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=392.34000000000003s)]
*  go to shelters and wait there until they hear the explosions overhead and they get the all [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=396.02000000000004s)]
*  clear. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=399.94000000000005s)]
*  Oh man. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=400.94000000000005s)]
*  Tel Aviv? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=401.94000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so I'm told by my producer right now they're firing on Tel Aviv. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=402.94000000000005s)]
*  And you thought it was short to medium range missiles? [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=408.1s)]
*  Yeah, so if they're firing on Tel Aviv, we're looking at medium to long range missiles. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=411.94000000000005s)]
*  Now Tel Aviv does have good air defense systems. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=417.62s)]
*  When this started, I was on the balcony of my apartment watching as the rockets were [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=420.46s)]
*  intercepted overhead, some of them slamming into the sea. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=425.02s)]
*  But it is an escalation when the factions inside Gaza fire on Tel Aviv. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=428.32s)]
*  And so we know this and we know that it could be their way to send a message as a response [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=432.9s)]
*  to the strikes in Gaza. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=438.24s)]
*  It also could just be the fact that they are varying the length at which they fire because [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=440.67999999999995s)]
*  they don't have enough rockets to constantly fire on Tel Aviv. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=444.21999999999997s)]
*  Sometimes they'll fire on the communities here along the border and other times they [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=447.44s)]
*  try to hit heavier populated areas. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=450.28s)]
*  Tel Aviv is Israel's second largest city. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=452.52s)]
*  It's a city with a beach on the Mediterranean. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=455.36s)]
*  There are a lot of nightclubs and restaurants and bars. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=457.64s)]
*  But today they're all closed. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=460.78s)]
*  People are at home. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=462.16s)]
*  They're doing everything they can to help the war effort because there's an understanding [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=463.16s)]
*  that this is a very active conflict and Israel needs all the help that it can get. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=466.68s)]
*  When you look at the Hamas missile stocks, I know 5,000 were shot off in 20 minutes on [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=471.20000000000005s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=478.76000000000005s)]
*  What do they tell you the Israelis think that they have? [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  It's a great question because there was intelligence that we received last year saying that Hamas [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=484.64000000000004s)]
*  had around 15,000 rockets, the Israelis believed. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=492.12s)]
*  And they thought Islamic Jihad, the second largest faction inside Gaza, had around 6,000 [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  or 7,000 rockets. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=499.40000000000003s)]
*  So you can do the math. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=500.64s)]
*  Eventually, they will run out of rockets or they will run low on rockets. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=501.64s)]
*  By that time, likely the fighting will be taking place inside Gaza and you'll see less [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=506.03999999999996s)]
*  rocket fire toward major population centers. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=510.59999999999997s)]
*  The attack that took place on Saturday is not the normal situation along the border. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=513.88s)]
*  There are occasionally infiltration attempts. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=519.12s)]
*  And so that's why when people initially saw rocket alerts, they knew something was wrong, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=521.48s)]
*  but they could have never imagined that this was going to be a massacre of 1,200 people. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=525.16s)]
*  And so we do know they have thousands of rockets, they have small arms, but they don't have [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=530.48s)]
*  an unlimited supply of rockets. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=534.86s)]
*  They can make rockets inside Gaza, but many of those manufacturing sites are going to [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=536.5s)]
*  get destroyed in the airstrikes that are taking place right now and the artillery fire from [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=540.94s)]
*  behind me. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=545.1400000000001s)]
*  They are building these rockets not just underground, but also in apartment buildings sometimes. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=546.34s)]
*  And they're storing a lot of the rockets in civilian areas. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=550.46s)]
*  Another challenge for the Israeli military as they try to work their way into Gaza during [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=553.0600000000001s)]
*  this operation whenever it does kick off. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=557.1400000000001s)]
*  Alright, Trey, thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=560.38s)]
*  Stay safe. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=563.2199999999999s)]
*  Thanks Trey. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=si9w1LKgyfo&t=564.2199999999999s)]
