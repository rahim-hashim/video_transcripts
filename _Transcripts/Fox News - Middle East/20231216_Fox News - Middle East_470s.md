# Mark Levin: Biden cares more about the Gaza Strip than the US
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc)
*  Welcome back America. A second, one of the greatest constitutional lawyers I [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=0.0s)]
*  know, David Shone, he worked on the one of the Trump impeachments, he's a fantastic [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=8.18s)]
*  criminal rights and criminal defense attorney. David Shone, you're in Jerusalem [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=14.48s)]
*  right now, so before I get to a couple legal questions I have for you based on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  what this Jack Smith is doing, which is really contemptible in my view, you're in [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=24.64s)]
*  Jerusalem, you get a sense of what's going on among the people there. In the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=29.68s)]
*  United States we have the New York Times, we have MSNBC and CNN, and other [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=33.76s)]
*  reprobates in this country who really are undermining Israel's effort to win [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=38.92s)]
*  this war, and almost a daily recitation of why Benjamin Netanyahu should be [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=43.8s)]
*  removed by hook or by crook, why his administration is right-wing, why they're [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=49.8s)]
*  responsible for everything going on. What is your sense in Israel? My sense is [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=54.92s)]
*  the people are united, they're focused on winning, and all the rest of this [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=59.2s)]
*  stuff doesn't matter right now. The people united as maybe never before. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=62.24s)]
*  These comments are terrible that undermine, use political bases for trying [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  to undermine the unity in Israel and what must be a consistent message that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=70.24000000000001s)]
*  Hamas, Palestine, Islamic Jihad, all of these terrorist groups must be destroyed. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=75.4s)]
*  Israel is fighting for its existence now and the United States must simply [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=79.96000000000001s)]
*  support that. We support our own interests in the United States [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=83.80000000000001s)]
*  when we support Israel. You're an American citizen, you see what's going on [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=87.32s)]
*  on our southern border, the mayhem, the rapes, selling children in the sex [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  slavery, you see the death from the fentanyl and other toxic drugs, hundreds [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=95.67999999999999s)]
*  of thousands of Americans over the course of two and a half years, you see [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=99.75999999999999s)]
*  our cities are overwhelmed, you see the mayhem and the anarchy, violations of our [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=104.0s)]
*  immigration laws by the current administration, and yet Joe Biden is [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=109.52s)]
*  talking about citizens in Gaza. He doesn't talk about citizens of America [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=113.88s)]
*  and how they're being treated based on his policies. He doesn't talk about the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=118.56s)]
*  citizens in Iran while we have wave sanctions on Iran so they can put down [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=122.52s)]
*  their citizens and kill them and rape them and torture them. He doesn't talk [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  about the citizens in Syria, the citizens in Saudi Arabia, the citizens in Yemen, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=130.88s)]
*  the citizens in Ukraine. Why do you think he's so myopic about the Gaza strip [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=135.44s)]
*  when we know for a fact that the Israelis are not trying to kill citizens? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  Not only not trying to kill citizens, even John Kirby has acknowledged the [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=146.64s)]
*  National Security Council spokesperson that the Israeli army acts in the most [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=149.88s)]
*  protective way of civilian casualties of any military in the world. Richard Kemp [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=153.76s)]
*  has said it from England, but I hope that President Biden was listening [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=159.07999999999998s)]
*  carefully today when the so called political head of Hamas said, we must [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=161.88s)]
*  engage in violent acts, attacks against the United States and Britain to force [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=167.56s)]
*  their hand to push for the ceasefire. They play into Hamas's hands. This is [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  part of their playbook from the start. Attack with atrocities, rape, torture, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=176.52s)]
*  murder, mutilation, and then push for a ceasefire and blame the civilians whose [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=181.36s)]
*  lives they would blame civilian deaths whose lives they don't care about. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=186.36s)]
*  Let me ask you this, David Sean. When this Biden Blinken administration are [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=189.84s)]
*  basically rearming the enemy Iran where Donald Trump had them on their back, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=194.92s)]
*  when we are giving money to UNRWA, which is a corrupt organization of the UN, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=200.16s)]
*  which then gives money to Hamas, when we are coddling Qatar, which gives money [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=205.16s)]
*  to Hamas and protects its leaders, when we give money to the PLO, the Arafat [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  founded PLO in violation of the Taylor Act, who commit acts of terrorism as [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=215.88s)]
*  well. And when we give money or allow money to flow into Iran that funds Hezbollah, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  how is it that the Biden administration and Blinken took no responsibility for [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=227.56s)]
*  what they've unleashed for the firestorm that they have created, which has led to [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=233.2s)]
*  October 7th and the atrocities against the Jews, which has led to every [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=238.12s)]
*  civilian death that's taking place in Gaza right now. How do they get off taking [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=242.83999999999997s)]
*  no responsibility whatsoever? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  They must take full responsibility for it. And one other to add to the list is [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=248.79999999999998s)]
*  they came into office and immediately removed the Houthis from the Foreign [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=252.51999999999998s)]
*  Terrorist Organization designation list. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=256.0s)]
*  Horrible move. The Trump administration had put them on it and now they're [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=259.28s)]
*  attacking our ships. They must take full responsibility for it. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=262.12s)]
*  As you said, the Trump administration had Iran on the verge of bankruptcy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=265.48s)]
*  These are Iranian puppets operating around the world. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=269.84s)]
*  I believe that when we fund UNRWA, when we fund all of the other entities you [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=272.48s)]
*  mentioned, we're providing material support directly and indirectly to [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=276.52s)]
*  foreign terrorist organizations and the Taylor Force Act, as you pointed out, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=280.76000000000005s)]
*  prohibits us from continuing to fund the Palestinian Authority as long as they're [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=284.48s)]
*  paying pay for slaves, so-called martyr money. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=288.68s)]
*  Their constituent components are the PFLP and other designated terrorist [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=291.64000000000004s)]
*  organizations. Money is fungible. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=295.76000000000005s)]
*  They're using this money to attack Israel, period. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=297.96000000000004s)]
*  Don't you find it amazing, David Shown, you've seen American media live in the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=301.04s)]
*  United States most of your year and so forth, that they don't even talk [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=305.96000000000004s)]
*  about this? Joe Biden's never even asked, well, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=310.68s)]
*  why are you continuing to pour billions and billions of dollars into these [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=313.36s)]
*  terrorist entities? And then on the other hand, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=316.68s)]
*  you keep telling Israel effectively to surrender its sovereignty. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=321.12s)]
*  You want to give away Judea and Samaria, they're the Israeli ancestral homes. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=324.56s)]
*  You want to give it to the Palestinians as a reward for what took place on October [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=329.12s)]
*  7th, and then you claim it's going to be peace, a two-state solution. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=333.88s)]
*  Did Iran not say two days ago, David Shown, doesn't care about two states and [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=337.96s)]
*  wants a caliphate. That's what they said. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=342.76s)]
*  Did Hamas not say the same thing? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=345.2s)]
*  We don't give a damn about two states. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=347.28s)]
*  We want a caliphate. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=349.28s)]
*  So a two-state solution is effectively Israel's final solution. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=350.84s)]
*  Is it not? Absolutely. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=354.76s)]
*  And that caliphate doesn't just end with Israel. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=356.15999999999997s)]
*  That's a world strategy, quite frankly, for Iran and its fellow travelers. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=358.24s)]
*  But, you know, as to why we're doing this, why we continue to fund it, I think [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=362.96s)]
*  the head of the horrible group, CARE, the other day, said it all when he was [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=367.64s)]
*  celebrating the Hamas atrocities in Israel. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=374.04s)]
*  He also said later on that the Biden administration seems to finally be [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=376.84s)]
*  listening to us when we tell them they're going to lose our votes if they continue [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=381.28s)]
*  to support Israel. This is an election year. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=385.32s)]
*  That apparently speaks volumes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=388.0s)]
*  We cannot allow political principle to be overcome by political [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=389.64s)]
*  expediency in trying to win an election. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=394.28000000000003s)]
*  We have to stand on principle. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=397.8s)]
*  We have to stand uniformly against terrorism. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=399.52000000000004s)]
*  This is the first time I could imagine both Hillary Clinton and Dennis Ross have [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=401.96000000000004s)]
*  said there shouldn't be a ceasefire early on in this thing. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=406.88000000000005s)]
*  And they continue to believe that. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=409.96000000000004s)]
*  Dennis Ross has finally taken responsibility for forcing Israel to allow concrete to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=411.04s)]
*  come into Hamas that built the tunnels. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=416.0s)]
*  Hamas has had since 2005 to build a democracy if that's what they wanted to do. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=418.40000000000003s)]
*  Instead, they squandered their money on building rockets, rocket factories, tunnels [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=422.72s)]
*  and ways to try to extinguish the state of Israel and the Jewish people worldwide. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=426.84s)]
*  I'll say this for me. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=431.28000000000003s)]
*  The Democrat Party has blood on its hands, even in the United States here, where it [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=433.12s)]
*  refuses to even vote in unity on resolutions that condemn what's taking place. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=438.96s)]
*  Joe Biden has public statements that the Israelis are indiscriminately bombing [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=444.16s)]
*  Gaza, Hezbollah, the Gazan civilians. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=449.44s)]
*  He is stoking anti-Semitism in this country. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=453.8s)]
*  It is grotesque. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7XFiYUdyPxc&t=457.0s)]
