# White House hopeful American hostages could be released
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko)
*  Yeah. All right. So another Fox News alert smoke rising in Gaza as we're now in what could be the final day of a temporary ceasefire between Israel and a mosque. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=0.0s)]
*  A sixth set of hostages are expected to be released today. They're going to join the 60 plus who have been freed so far. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=9.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, the White House hoping Americans will be included in this batch after none were released in yesterday's exchange. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=16.4s)]
*  All right, Greg Palcott, Tel Aviv. Hey, Greg. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=22.6s)]
*  Hey, folks. Yeah, we are in Tel Aviv. We're at various hospitals in this area. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=27.5s)]
*  Those released hostages are being treated after their horrible treatment by the hands of Hamas and Gaza Strip. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=32.0s)]
*  Twelve hostages were freed overnight. These former captives telling horror stories for weeks. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=39.5s)]
*  There was little food and light, difficult sleeping and sanitary conditions. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=44.4s)]
*  One young man told of beatings and being forced to watch torture videos. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=48.2s)]
*  All told some 60 Israeli women and children, plus others have been released. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=53.5s)]
*  It's believed another 160 remain held by Hamas and other groups, among them 10 month old Kfir Bibus and other family members. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=57.4s)]
*  A relative told you folks earlier, the Israeli government says they won't be released today. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=67.5s)]
*  We try to remain hopeful. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=73.8s)]
*  We continue with our battle and efforts as a family, as a united family to try and get some answers. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=79.19999999999999s)]
*  Strong stuff as part of the deal. Palestinian prisoners are also being released. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=93.1s)]
*  What's being worked on right now by the U.S., Israel and Hamas go betweens an extension of the ceasefire and hostage exchange. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=97.0s)]
*  That's all set to end overnight. Crucial too in these days. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  Humanitarian being brought into the battered Gaza Strip with most of the fighting on pause. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=108.5s)]
*  Now it's a chance to reach people there amid the death and destruction. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  Again, the reason reported that little baby Kfir and his family might not be released easily. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=117.0s)]
*  They are being held, it is said, by another militant group in Gaza. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=124.2s)]
*  That just shows how complicated the situation is. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=129.1s)]
*  Why diplomats at this very moment are fighting for more time before full scale fighting could resume in Gaza. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=132.1s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=138.8s)]
*  All right. Thanks Greg. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=139.9s)]
*  3 0 7 in the afternoon. Not too much more time until we see who's on the list. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nl89ZoyoDko&t=141.0s)]
