# Son of Hamas leader: US doing this could prevent World War III
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs)
*  Let's bring in Mossad. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=0.0s)]
*  He's the son of founding member of Hamas [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=1.6s)]
*  and author of Son of Hamas. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=3.56s)]
*  He grew up in that environment, went to prison, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=4.96s)]
*  realized that he wanted a different life [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=7.84s)]
*  and is now here to give us insight on Hamas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=10.58s)]
*  and the organization the Israelis hope to take apart. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=13.48s)]
*  First off, Mossad, great to see you. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=16.94s)]
*  I'm wondering, did you know the guy [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=18.98s)]
*  that we just took out, that Israel just took out? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=20.88s)]
*  I didn't know him personally. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=26.42s)]
*  How significant is this? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=29.02s)]
*  Not a high profile. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=33.58s)]
*  I think he's important because he was part [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=35.06s)]
*  of the operation on October 7th. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=37.32s)]
*  We are looking for the big names, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=40.96s)]
*  Mohammed Addaif, Yahya Al-Sinwar [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=43.4s)]
*  and other Hamas top leaders. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=47.44s)]
*  When we start, and I think soon we are going [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=50.1s)]
*  to start hearing about their names down. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=52.6s)]
*  And I hope just like Dominos. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=57.44s)]
*  Well, this guy was important because in addition [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=60.28s)]
*  to one of the directors of the October 7th attack, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=62.72s)]
*  he also was one of the guys in charge of their, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=65.74s)]
*  what they refer to as their aerial forces. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=69.82s)]
*  He helped develop drones and paragliders, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=71.88s)]
*  which of course famously were used [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=74.38s)]
*  on October the 7th, Mossad. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=76.52s)]
*  Look, I commend all the warriors right now on the ground. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=80.02s)]
*  They are brave, they are fighting on our behalf [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=84.24000000000001s)]
*  and your behalf, on behalf of the free world. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=87.52s)]
*  They are courageous and we give them all the support [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=90.3s)]
*  that they need. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=94.1s)]
*  This is good progress, okay? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=94.96s)]
*  We are paused, but we have lots of work to do. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=96.69999999999999s)]
*  And now we need a very strong siege. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=99.69999999999999s)]
*  We need a siege. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=104.1s)]
*  Then we need somehow to put pressure [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=105.78s)]
*  on the Egyptian government so they can open the border [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=108.17999999999999s)]
*  for the Gazanets to just depart. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=110.82s)]
*  I don't care if they depart for good. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=112.91999999999999s)]
*  They can go for good. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=115.32s)]
*  We don't need Gaza there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=117.24s)]
*  You know, Gaza is a big refugee camp [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=118.44s)]
*  that was supposed to be demolished 70 years ago, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=122.02s)]
*  but they kept at the hope that were given [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=125.78s)]
*  by the United Nations and the Arab countries. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=128.26s)]
*  And this is how we have this crisis right now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=130.78s)]
*  At this moment, we have war. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=133.36s)]
*  Civilians are there, wrong place. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=135.46s)]
*  Instead of the United Nations blaming everybody [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=137.9s)]
*  and saying humanitarian crisis, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=140.74s)]
*  they should allow the civilians evacuate. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=143.72s)]
*  Egypt has to open the borders. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=147.28s)]
*  The United States must put pressure, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=152.2s)]
*  apply tremendous pressure on the Egyptian government [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=154.6s)]
*  to open the freaking border. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=157.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, the United States give Egypt in military aid [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=159.76s)]
*  close to $1.3 billion from the taxpayer money every year. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=163.0s)]
*  They can put some pressure. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=167.2s)]
*  Israel cannot put pressure on Egypt, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=168.67999999999998s)]
*  but I think the United States can. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=170.88s)]
*  Let all the Palestinians who are in the Gaza Strip [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=172.8s)]
*  evacuate immediately so Israel can do the job correctly [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=175.96s)]
*  and eradicate this barbaric organization. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=179.6s)]
*  Masab, I hear the frustration in your voice [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=182.68s)]
*  and your point is duly noted because as you know, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=186.72s)]
*  Hamas is using all the civilians that is there [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=190.76s)]
*  as human shields, but I wanna go back into the organization [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=193.96s)]
*  because I also heard your frustration there. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=197.58s)]
*  What you're saying is that this guy will be easily replaced. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=200.52s)]
*  Most of the leaders don't live on the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=204.6s)]
*  They're not even there. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=207.48s)]
*  So can you explain to our audience [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=208.68s)]
*  what the organization structure is of Hamas? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=211.52s)]
*  Okay, this guy belongs to the military wing, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=217.64s)]
*  but Israel is not only going against the military wing [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=221.12s)]
*  on the Gaza front. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=225.52s)]
*  Trust me, as we speak right now, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=227.44s)]
*  we have a dozen of intelligence services around the globe, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=229.06s)]
*  including Arab intelligence services, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=231.68s)]
*  that they are on the tail of Hamas leaders abroad, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=233.6s)]
*  especially the political wing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=237.0s)]
*  And sooner or later, they are going to be brought to justice. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=239.44s)]
*  They're not gonna get away with this. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=242.44s)]
*  But the Gaza front is the most significant front right now [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=244.28s)]
*  because there are civilians involved. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=248.56s)]
*  There are hostages involved and we have to move slowly. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  So every day you are going to hear about those guys. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=254.12s)]
*  We will eradicate them. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=256.6s)]
*  I'm sure Israel is determined and it has the power, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=257.7s)]
*  but we cannot move in very fast. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=260.1s)]
*  We have to apply unbreachable siege [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=263.74s)]
*  and for long enough to deplete Hamas, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=269.26s)]
*  to deprive them, to starve them. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=272.38s)]
*  We have to cut every mean of life from them. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=275.3s)]
*  Then after that, we can move faster. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=279.86s)]
*  But as of now, we cannot risk more lives, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=282.26s)]
*  more Israeli soldiers lives by pushing them [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  towards suicidal group. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=289.64s)]
*  So we have to move slowly. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=291.03999999999996s)]
*  So Musab, you're for the slow maneuver, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=292.56s)]
*  not the D-Day type invasion, but a slow maneuver forward. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=297.44s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=300.36s)]
*  Yeah, they're about two miles in and yesterday, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=301.2s)]
*  they freed one hostage. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=303.91999999999996s)]
*  I can imagine she's gonna talk. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=305.96s)]
*  The other hostages that they release are talking. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=307.8s)]
*  Do you think that the best way to get the hostages out [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=310.28s)]
*  is to move the IDF in? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=313.36s)]
*  Look, the best way to do is to work silently [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=320.14s)]
*  and collect intelligence. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=323.94s)]
*  This is what we need. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=325.42s)]
*  We need information. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=326.42s)]
*  The moment we have information, it doesn't matter. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  Even if they are 20 miles away, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=330.58000000000004s)]
*  there will be a special force going behind the enemy lines. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=333.14s)]
*  It doesn't matter where they are [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=336.54s)]
*  and we will get to the hostages. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=338.46000000000004s)]
*  But most importantly, we need intelligence. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=340.74s)]
*  It's good that we are on the ground [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=342.62s)]
*  because this gets us closer to target. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=344.16s)]
*  And I hope that within the next days or weeks, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=347.7s)]
*  we will have good news. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=350.7s)]
*  And I'm sure Israel doing everything they can [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=351.78000000000003s)]
*  to bring those hostages back to their families. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=354.78000000000003s)]
*  You mentioned the top commanders, you named them. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=357.14s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=360.12s)]
*  Well, Sinwar most likely is under Al-Shifa Hospital, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=364.26s)]
*  some 30 meters deep in the sand, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=367.48s)]
*  which sand is very resilient to bombing. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=371.02s)]
*  It's not easy to get to him. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=374.71999999999997s)]
*  And in order to kill him, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=375.94s)]
*  probably we will have to destroy the entire hospital. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  But he's not going to hide forever. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=383.12s)]
*  We're coming after him. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=386.94s)]
*  Armies, angels of heavens and earth [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=389.14s)]
*  are after those terrorists and barbaric people. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=392.58s)]
*  We are going to eradicate them. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=398.84s)]
*  There is no escape. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=401.66s)]
*  There is no escape. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=402.5s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=403.32s)]
*  Even if he escapes Gaza, we are going after him. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=404.16s)]
*  Everybody knows. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=406.74s)]
*  Mosab, the IDF says in the last day, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=407.58s)]
*  they struck 300 targets, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=410.78000000000003s)]
*  including anti-tank missile and rocket launch posts, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=412.46000000000004s)]
*  which were below shafts, they say, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=416.46000000000004s)]
*  as well as military compounds inside underground tunnels [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=419.1s)]
*  belonging to the Hamas terrorist organization. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=423.06s)]
*  So the IDF is down in the tunnels [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=426.44s)]
*  and apparently it sounds like the militants are responding. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=429.74s)]
*  They're shooting anti-tank missiles [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=432.3s)]
*  and machine gun fire at the IDF. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=434.54s)]
*  The question for you regarding this is, [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=438.14s)]
*  knowing what you do about Hamas, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=441.34000000000003s)]
*  when you're down in the tunnels, [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=444.52s)]
*  are those tunnels booby-trapped? [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=445.82s)]
*  Are people wearing belt bombs [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  like we saw with Al-Qaeda and ISIS? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=449.5s)]
*  I mean, what do IDF soldiers have to worry about [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=452.14s)]
*  when they're down in that hole? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=455.06s)]
*  Well, first of all, they have different types of tunnels. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=456.98s)]
*  The IDF talking about most likely offensive tunnels. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=462.26s)]
*  Those are the closer tunnels to the Israeli border. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=465.62s)]
*  This type of tunnels Hamas use for, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=469.5s)]
*  or they constructed with the goal [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=472.34000000000003s)]
*  to deploy their members behind the enemy line [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=477.42s)]
*  in case of Israel invasion. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=481.38s)]
*  So now this is the most common. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=483.58000000000004s)]
*  So now this is the job of the IDF [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=486.06s)]
*  and it's why they have to move slowly [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=487.98s)]
*  because we need to discover all these tunnels. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=489.46000000000004s)]
*  And I think without revealing so much, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=492.22s)]
*  the IDF has technology. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=495.66s)]
*  They have technology to detect [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=498.14000000000004s)]
*  and be able to at least cut the snake in small parts. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=499.64000000000004s)]
*  If they are not able to cut the head, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=504.98s)]
*  we can cut the snake in small parts, [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=506.38s)]
*  which will not allow Hamas to escape those tunnels. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=508.38s)]
*  So we can trap them in those tunnels. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=511.34000000000003s)]
*  Not having to say much about this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=514.46s)]
*  So now the target is the offensive tunnels. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=516.1800000000001s)]
*  Later on is going to be a lot more complicated, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=520.26s)]
*  which is the defensive tunnels. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=522.7s)]
*  Those are the ones under the populated areas. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=524.62s)]
*  Hence, I say the United States must put pressure on Egypt [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=526.86s)]
*  to open the border. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=531.58s)]
*  We need all the civilians out [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=532.4200000000001s)]
*  so we can have the freedom to eradicate them. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=533.62s)]
*  But Masoud, is it just getting the civilians out? [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=536.74s)]
*  I mean, knowing what you know about the organization, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=540.52s)]
*  knowing what you know about the tunnel structure, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=542.58s)]
*  knowing that there's going to be a lot of HR, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=545.14s)]
*  hostage rescues, can Israel do it [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=546.0999999999999s)]
*  without the United States help on the ground as well? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=550.3399999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=555.3399999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=557.2199999999999s)]
*  And the United States, whether we like it or not, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=558.06s)]
*  we are part of this war. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=560.0999999999999s)]
*  Because if we don't show power, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=561.62s)]
*  we are going to be next. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=565.14s)]
*  In fact, this Hamas, Iran, Russia [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=567.14s)]
*  is aiming at the United States through Israel. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=571.06s)]
*  So we all realize this problem. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=574.66s)]
*  In fact, I would like to see more presence [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=576.06s)]
*  of the United States, more military presence. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=577.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm not talking about military action. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=579.86s)]
*  There is a big difference between having the presence [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=581.66s)]
*  that we are here, we are ready. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=584.22s)]
*  And if you dare to launch a missile from Iran [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=586.42s)]
*  or from Hezbollah, we are going to hit you [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=589.46s)]
*  and we're going to hit you very hard. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=591.22s)]
*  So this, just waving the stick, [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=593.1s)]
*  I'm not saying to take part, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=595.9399999999999s)]
*  could prevent us from a regional war, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=600.1s)]
*  could prevent us from World War III. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=602.88s)]
*  Yeah, but the problem is we're not hitting back at all. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=604.84s)]
*  We've been attacked 23 times in Iraq and in Syria. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=607.08s)]
*  Is that a problem in the world that you left? [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=610.32s)]
*  Sorry, I did not understand the question. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=616.16s)]
*  We've been hit in our bases in Iraq [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=617.96s)]
*  and in Syria multiple times, 23 times. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=620.48s)]
*  We've only answered back once. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=624.0s)]
*  Is that a problem in the land that you left? [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=625.88s)]
*  Well, for the time being, let's stay in the high waters. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=630.56s)]
*  Let's stay in the sea. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=635.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm not saying ground bases and moving on the ground. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=635.92s)]
*  Let's stay on the high seas, show them the American might. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  Yep, that would be great. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  Masaab, Hassan, Yousef, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=646.1199999999999s)]
*  thanks so much for joining us today. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=648.7199999999999s)]
*  We'll call on you again, appreciate it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTSyWO5pyhs&t=650.52s)]
