# At least 11 Americans killed in Israel; death toll tops 900
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY)
*  It is 3 o'clock in Israel and happening right now Israel's military continuing to launch [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=0.0s)]
*  air strikes against Hamas targets in Gaza City on day 4 of the war in the Holy Land. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=12.72s)]
*  And we are now learning that IDF and Israeli police have rescued 30 people from the kibbutz [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  in the southern part of Israel. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  Greg Palkot is live on the ground in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=29.48s)]
*  Greg? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=32.24s)]
*  It's a busy time here I gotta say, Brian and folks. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=33.24s)]
*  We just saw another battery of rockets come from the Hamas arsenal over from Gaza Strip [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=38.2s)]
*  just about 2 miles from where we are over this town of Zerat and the Iron Dome. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=46.44s)]
*  Israeli defenses were working. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  Boom, boom, boom, boom. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  We heard about 5 of them knock down. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=55.760000000000005s)]
*  We were in a shelter just about 20 yards away from where we are. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=58.84s)]
*  So there's activity. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=62.080000000000005s)]
*  We've been hearing Israeli jet fighters over our heads all day pounding positions in Gaza. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=63.080000000000005s)]
*  As I just mentioned, we've been seeing the rockets going another way and we've been seeing [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=69.72s)]
*  dozens and dozens of tanks lining up getting ready for a possible incursion. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=73.76s)]
*  This is day 4. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=78.76s)]
*  We are in the town of Zerat and believe it or not, it has taken 4 days for Israel to [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=80.12s)]
*  say this town and 21 others like it on the other side of the Gaza Strip border is secure. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=86.6s)]
*  Behind me I'll ask Cameron Randall to give us a shot is the police station. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=92.24s)]
*  That is what is left of it after a final shootout between the Hamas militants, police and soldiers. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=97.52s)]
*  Many, many died there both ways. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=106.03999999999999s)]
*  It's now being destroyed very quickly. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=108.19999999999999s)]
*  We asked one resident, why are you doing this now? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=110.88s)]
*  Why is this happening with everything else going on? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=114.2s)]
*  They said they want to destroy it, that is clear it, so they can rebuild again. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=116.32s)]
*  That is the spirit here, guys, the spirit of determination. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=122.2s)]
*  We're seeing it again and again and again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=125.32s)]
*  We're seeing those very strong figures, 900 plus Israelis killed, 700 plus Palestinians. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=128.12s)]
*  We're hearing about the claim coming from the Israeli military today, 1,500 Hamas militants [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=134.85999999999999s)]
*  killed on Israeli soldiers. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=142.0s)]
*  Quite an accomplishment, if accurate, by the Israelis, but also a sign of thousands of [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=143.96s)]
*  militants that must have come across the border on Saturday and stayed active again right [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=150.04s)]
*  until this very day. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=155.2s)]
*  You've been talking about it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=158.08s)]
*  It's another huge part of the story. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=159.36s)]
*  The hostages taken from this town and from other towns being held in Gaza. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=161.04s)]
*  We have some sound from an individual who was at a music festival, whose relative is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=166.36s)]
*  at a music festival where some of the hostages were taken. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=171.44s)]
*  Take a listen to this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=175.12s)]
*  We thought he was going to come back home safely, but then we realized that we saw from [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=176.12s)]
*  the news that the terrorists actually got in. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=182.84s)]
*  We managed to get a video of Omer cuffed up in the back of a pickup truck. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=184.8s)]
*  It's a music festival. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=190.28s)]
*  It should not have ended like this, and we hope that he's going to come back home safely. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=191.28s)]
*  We all hope. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=199.16s)]
*  The U.S., of course, doesn't need to be sad, but I will say it has a big stake in what's [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=200.24s)]
*  going on here. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=204.9s)]
*  At least 11 American citizens killed in part of that death toll, and several, it is believed, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=205.96s)]
*  Americans being held hostage. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=214.44s)]
*  So State Department of Washington, of course, washing this closely as well, and the Pentagon [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=216.0s)]
*  giving assistance. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=221.4s)]
*  Munitions being flown in and ships coming off the coast, off the Mediterranean coast, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=222.4s)]
*  a sign of strength, a show of support really by the United States for Israel. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=227.56s)]
*  We heard from Prime Minister Netanyahu last night there will be further strong action, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=233.28s)]
*  which generations, he said, will remember it, decades and decades. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=238.84s)]
*  We will see what that action will be. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=243.68s)]
*  Will it be more strikes? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=245.44s)]
*  Will it be the overland massive incursion that many people think might happen? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=246.9s)]
*  We're seeing a lot of activity here. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=252.26s)]
*  Yes, we're seeing that destruction, but we're seeing a lot of current-day war activity right [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=254.60000000000002s)]
*  now, right here. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=260.28000000000003s)]
*  Back to you guys. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=261.28000000000003s)]
*  Hey, Greg, I know everyone's focused on Gaza. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=262.28000000000003s)]
*  Has everyone, have you heard about skirmishes in the north with Hezbollah? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=264.36s)]
*  Can you expand on that? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=269.88s)]
*  Do you hear about any military movements up there that would make this a two-front war? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=271.48s)]
*  Brian, that is the big fear, that this becomes a multi-front war. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=276.88s)]
*  Hezbollah has been careful. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=281.88s)]
*  That is the militant group based in southern Lebanon. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  Hezbollah has been careful to not completely commit, but there have been individuals that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=287.08s)]
*  have come across either associated with Hezbollah or other militant groups. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=292.44s)]
*  Two have been killed, one have been captured, and they have struck bases in the north. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=296.64s)]
*  The Israeli army has sent loads of tanks up there. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=301.71999999999997s)]
*  That is the fear. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=307.48s)]
*  There's enough to deal with here on so many fronts here, but if you open up a second front [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=308.72s)]
*  or third front, you can imagine Israel will completely have its hands full. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=313.6s)]
*  Brian? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=318.76000000000005s)]
*  Lawrence? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=319.76000000000005s)]
*  Some reporting done that Hamas, when they were firing missiles, that they were mixing [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=320.76000000000005s)]
*  the batch of missiles with these missiles that really couldn't do any damage to overwhelm [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  the Iron Dome. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=333.48s)]
*  Are they still doing that? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=334.88000000000005s)]
*  They certainly are. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=337.44s)]
*  I mean, again, in the last 20 minutes we've had a taste of it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=339.44s)]
*  We heard the Iron Dome in action, knocking down about five or six rockets coming from [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=342.84s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=348.56s)]
*  We were talking to a photographer we were with said, five, yeah, have you seen 300 come [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=350.28s)]
*  across? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=356.56s)]
*  I said, well, not this time I haven't. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=357.56s)]
*  He said he's seen 300 come at the same time. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  And basically, even with crude missiles, you can swamp the very, very sophisticated [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=362.4s)]
*  defenses of the Iron Dome. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=367.84s)]
*  And that's exactly what they did. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=369.64s)]
*  And that was part of the destruction, especially in the first few days. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=370.96s)]
*  And Hamas is keeping at it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=375.28s)]
*  We can tell you we have experience from today. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=376.91999999999996s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=379.52s)]
*  Greg, I know the border is secure. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=380.52s)]
*  And there have been 1,500, you were reporting 1,500 Hamas terrorists that were killed in [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=384.08s)]
*  Israel. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=388.71999999999997s)]
*  Are there more Hamas fighters there in Israel? [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=389.72s)]
*  Again, the Israeli military this morning said they had absolutely secure towns like this [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=392.8s)]
*  and other towns. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=400.16s)]
*  They were confident about that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=401.16s)]
*  They said in a few hours we will secure the whole area. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=402.6s)]
*  So they were thinking about some remnant militants. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  But I think what we saw, not just on Saturday, but on Sunday too, a large number of not just [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=408.96000000000004s)]
*  reinforcement from militants coming all over, that has been clamped down. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=416.48s)]
*  This place is a military zone right now. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=421.04s)]
*  Again, we were about three miles away on the main road that heads right into the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=424.76s)]
*  And we saw maybe about 30 or 40 tanks lined up, ready to go if the message comes through [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=431.04s)]
*  from the prime minister, from the government to move forward. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=438.20000000000005s)]
*  Careful stuff, though. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=441.68s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=442.68s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. President, Greg. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=443.88s)]
*  We have just heard from the IDF that IDF fighters have killed a number of armed terrorists in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=445.04s)]
*  the one beach area a short time ago. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=451.12s)]
*  And more details are going to be coming up very shortly. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=454.16s)]
*  But you were mentioning the hostages who are essentially human shields because they're [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=457.12s)]
*  being held somewhere in Gaza. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=461.32s)]
*  Hamas has said we're going to kill one hostage at a time unless we are notified that you [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=465.12s)]
*  are going to bomb a building. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=470.78000000000003s)]
*  And overnight, the IDF hit 200 targets in Gaza. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=472.56s)]
*  They hit a weapon storage site, which was in a mosque. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=477.28s)]
*  They hit an apartment used by Hamas's anti-tank guided missile forces and a high-rise tower [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=481.64s)]
*  used by Hamas as well. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=487.32s)]
*  And apparently, it sounds like the residents were notified via social media just before [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=489.46s)]
*  the strike. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=497.14s)]
*  What social media, it sounds like, is the front wave of how they're notifying people? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=498.26s)]
*  Yeah, social media one way. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  A couple of years ago, it was actually cell phone messages. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=506.9s)]
*  Now they graduated to that. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=511.34s)]
*  But Israel does make a point of that, either saying an exact building or an area. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=512.62s)]
*  And that is in part addressing those blood-curdling messages that we heard from Hamas last night [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=520.1s)]
*  about the potential deaths of the hostages. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=527.9000000000001s)]
*  There were claimed to be three or four hostages killed in a strike by Israel, but we have [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=531.1800000000001s)]
*  no confirmation of that. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=537.3000000000001s)]
*  It's a terribly gray zone right here now as the war continues. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=539.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=544.1s)]
*  So Danny Dannen, the former Deputy Secretary of Defense, defense minister there, former [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=545.1s)]
*  UN ambassador from Israel, now a member of the Knesset, joined us earlier. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=549.58s)]
*  And he said the focus has never been hitting civilians, but they are going to hit hard. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=554.66s)]
*  Watch. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=558.9399999999999s)]
*  We were able to push back all the terrorists who penetrated the communities in the south. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=559.9399999999999s)]
*  And now we're getting ready for the next stage, to go on offense. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=566.5799999999999s)]
*  The people of Gaza should move out from their homes. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=570.14s)]
*  I want to tell them now, if they are watching us, get out from your homes and move away [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=573.3399999999999s)]
*  from Hamas headquarters, because we are coming in. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=578.06s)]
*  We are coming to hunt down Hamas. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=581.3s)]
*  We don't want to hurt the civilians. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=583.46s)]
*  So, Greg, that's what they've got to do. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=584.94s)]
*  They've got to go after the bad guys, but they've got to protect the good guys. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=587.58s)]
*  That's what they're saying. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=593.1s)]
*  And those are some strong words that you just played there, guys. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=594.1s)]
*  The problem is there's 2.3 million people living in Gaza and the Gaza Strip, just about [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=598.14s)]
*  the size geographically of New York City. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=604.82s)]
*  So, very crowded, no shelters, a difficult way to get out of that strip. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=609.46s)]
*  And they are, to some degree, being hit very, very hard. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=614.98s)]
*  There are scenes that we have been shown of the damage that's been done by Israel. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=619.7s)]
*  It's hitting Hamas, but it's hitting people around Hamas, too. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=626.26s)]
*  It must be said, strong scenes and strong words coming from both sides, guys. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=631.22s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=636.46s)]
*  Thank you so much, Greg. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbmogHA8iUY&t=637.46s)]
