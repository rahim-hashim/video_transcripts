# Condoleezza Rice to Hannity on Israel: 'Brutal terrorist attack' by Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18)
*  Hi, welcome back to Hannity. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=0.0s)]
*  We are continuing to monitor the war in Israel with Hamas here for a Hannity exclusive interview, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  her first since the terror attacks this past weekend. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Former Secretary of State, current director of the Hoover Institution, and by the way, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=12.32s)]
*  a member of Augusta, of which I'm very jealous, Condoleezza Rice is with us. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=17.2s)]
*  Dr. Rice, great to have you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=21.6s)]
*  I've not seen you in a long time. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  I know you- [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=25.76s)]
*  It has been a long time, Sean. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=26.76s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=27.76s)]
*  Good to have you, as usual. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=29.520000000000003s)]
*  You know a lot about terror. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=31.28s)]
*  When you extrapolate out, I've been trying to give perspective as to how big this attack [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=34.2s)]
*  was, over 1,200 dead Israelis as of now, and there probably will be more by the time the [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=39.08s)]
*  count is full and complete. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=45.28s)]
*  And when you extrapolate that out and you look at the Israeli population and you apply [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=48.08s)]
*  that same percentage to the U.S. population, it would be the equivalent of losing over [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=54.88s)]
*  37,000 Americans in a single day. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=60.72s)]
*  We lost 2,977 people on a day you know well, 9-11-01. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=63.6s)]
*  And the magnitude of that, I don't know if people understand it around the world. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=71.68s)]
*  What does it mean to you? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=76.36s)]
*  Well, the magnitude of it is extraordinary. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=78.16s)]
*  And I've said to people, Sean, yes, there are the lives that were lost in that way, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=82.16s)]
*  but it would be as if the terrorists then went into small New York towns and slaughtered [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=86.72s)]
*  people up close, that they exterminated people, that they cut off the heads of babies. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=92.44s)]
*  The scale of this brutality and this barbarity is something that we really haven't seen [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=100.03999999999999s)]
*  in a very, very long time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=105.1s)]
*  And I think you have to look at both sides of it. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=106.94s)]
*  The loss of life is horrendous, but what the people of Israel are feeling in terms [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=110.52s)]
*  of the shock of what this was like, I just can't even imagine it, even after having [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  been myself the national security advisor on September 11th. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=121.84s)]
*  Are you as shocked as I am at the level of anti-Semitism that we've seen both around [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=125.19999999999999s)]
*  the world, on our own college campuses and cities and towns across this country? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=129.6s)]
*  Did you ever think you'd see people in Australia saying gas the Jews, F the Jews, or have tomorrow [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=136.12s)]
*  a day of jihad all over the world, which should scare anybody in any city that would be a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=145.12s)]
*  target? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=152.28s)]
*  Pretty frightening times, Madam Secretary. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=153.76s)]
*  It is, and I'm very, I'm shocked by it, and I'm sad by it, Sean, because anti-Semitism, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=156.32s)]
*  look, is always just beneath the surface in a lot of places. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=163.32s)]
*  I did a lot of work with the Anti-Defamation League when I was secretary. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=165.92s)]
*  I spoke at a couple of events that they had, and this kind of hatred is something that [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=171.72s)]
*  I am afraid has been a part of the fabric, unfortunately, of civilized places for a long [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=178.84s)]
*  time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=183.76s)]
*  And so, yes, I'm saddened, but I also am hopeful that there are voices that are speaking [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=184.76s)]
*  strongly about the hate that this is, that are speaking about and condemning this terrorist [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=191.68s)]
*  attack, and that's what it was. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=197.56s)]
*  It's a brutal terrorist attack of the kind that we haven't seen since perhaps ISIS [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=199.72000000000003s)]
*  was roaming around the Middle East. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=205.84s)]
*  And so, yes, it's sad. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=208.24s)]
*  I do think it's an opportunity in places like our own universities to say to our students, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=210.68s)]
*  take the time to understand this conflict in the Middle East, understand that Israelis [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=217.52s)]
*  have tried to help Palestinians to a two-state solution, and a lot of decent Palestinians [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=223.96s)]
*  have tried to. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=230.20000000000002s)]
*  And every time we've gotten close to peace, Hamas and Hezbollah and Palestinian Islamic [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=231.16s)]
*  Jihad have done something to dash the hopes of innocent Palestinians. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=238.16000000000003s)]
*  And so, these are not the liberators of the Palestinian people. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=244.44s)]
*  These are the oppressors of the Palestinian people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  And these, of course, are the barbarians who attacked the Israelis. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=254.8s)]
*  What do you make of the reports, Wall Street Journal and many other sources, and even Hamas [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=260.0s)]
*  and Hezbollah leaders themselves admitting that Iran's involvement in this? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=265.16s)]
*  Iran is the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=270.88s)]
*  To me, I think they've got to be held accountable. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=274.0s)]
*  To me, that would mean military action in this sense, and I'm not saying necessarily [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=277.6s)]
*  even by the United States, taking out the refineries, because that is the source of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=281.24s)]
*  their income to fund terror. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=285.8s)]
*  And number two, we know where these nuclear facilities are. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=287.88s)]
*  And if there is ever a marriage between the radical mullahs' ideology and weapons of mass [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=292.14s)]
*  I believe they would use them. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=299.76s)]
*  But these sites, where we know are located deep buried underground, it would be a very [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=301.6s)]
*  difficult military mission to take them out. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=307.2s)]
*  But I think the world has to, at some point, probably soon, take them out. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=310.96000000000004s)]
*  Your reaction? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=315.56s)]
*  Well, I would start by saying that, yes, Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, bears some responsibility [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=316.56s)]
*  for what has happened. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=324.90000000000003s)]
*  I know there are questions about how directly were they involved, but we know that Iran [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=325.9s)]
*  is the major, the primary funder of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=331.06s)]
*  They are the trainer of these groups. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=337.67999999999995s)]
*  And of course, they were celebrating in Tehran when this happened. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  The question of what we do more broadly about Iran I think is an important one. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=345.4s)]
*  For starts, let's not go back to the pretense that we can have an agreement with the Iranians [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=350.64s)]
*  about their nuclear facilities. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=357.14s)]
*  Let's not go back to the place where we're releasing funding to the Iranian mullahs, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=359.02s)]
*  who then just use that funding for Hezbollah and Hamas. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=365.18s)]
*  That would be a good start. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=369.94s)]
*  And let's try again to isolate the Iranians in the way that we had earlier in the Bush [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=371.58s)]
*  administration and in the Trump administration. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=378.2s)]
*  The idea that you can deal with the Iranians, you might find reasonable ways to deal with [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=381.8s)]
*  the Iranians. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=386.8s)]
*  It seems to me that this is just one more example of what we've seen over this last [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=387.8s)]
*  few days, that the Iranians are a revisionist power. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=392.0s)]
*  They are the most dangerous power in the region. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=396.16s)]
*  And oh, by the way, Sean, we gave up military facilities in Afghanistan, a country that [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=398.68s)]
*  has a hundreds long kilometer border with Iran. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=405.38s)]
*  That was a mistake in its own right. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=410.3s)]
*  And so how to deal with Iran, I think it starts with isolating them. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=412.5s)]
*  I think it starts with what actually the Biden administration has done. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=417.38s)]
*  I think sending the carrier battle groups into the region is a good idea. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=420.46000000000004s)]
*  But this should really erase any notion that the Iranian regime can be dealt with. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has been way too long. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=431.66s)]
*  Great to have you back. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=435.0s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=436.0s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MPxE-QGfV18&t=437.0s)]
