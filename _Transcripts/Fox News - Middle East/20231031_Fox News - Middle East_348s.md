# Massive airstrike hits Gaza as Israeli forces move in
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 31, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik)
*  Okay, Trey Yanks is live in southern Israel as this hearing tries to get underway. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll bring it to you as soon as that happens, but Trey Yanks has important information from [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  southern Israel for us now. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=7.78s)]
*  Hi, Trey. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=9.36s)]
*  Dana, I just want you to look at our shot here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=10.36s)]
*  There is a massive airstrike that just took place. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=15.08s)]
*  And where is that, Trey? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=22.44s)]
*  You can see off in the distance there, Dana, that airstrike just took place right along [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=26.16s)]
*  the Israel-Gaza border. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=31.020000000000003s)]
*  We've been watching throughout the day as Israeli forces are operating inside Gaza. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  You can see individual soldiers just over the past hour, and they were joined by tanks [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=38.82s)]
*  and D-9 bulldozers. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=44.72s)]
*  It just gives you a sense of how they are operating against the Hamas militants inside [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=46.8s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=52.28s)]
*  It is an ongoing battle, and we do understand it has been an intense battle. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=53.44s)]
*  The Israelis say they have been engaged in a firefight with Hamas overnight and into [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=57.44s)]
*  today. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=62.400000000000006s)]
*  We do have some information for you that we can't quite share yet, a lot of sensitive [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  details coming out of what's taking place inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=67.5s)]
*  But we do have some video of the Israeli forces operating inside Gaza. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=71.32s)]
*  They are pushing deeper into the Strip each and every day as those airstrikes continue. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=75.76s)]
*  Also, artillery units remain active along the border. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=80.72s)]
*  And there was one piece of good news overnight amid all of the conversations here about what's [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=84.12s)]
*  taking place on the ground, and that was that Ori Magadish, a private in the Israeli army, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=89.84s)]
*  was rescued by her colleagues inside Gaza. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=95.08s)]
*  They conducted an operation with the help of the Israeli intelligence, the Shin Bet, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=98.72s)]
*  and they were able to free her from captivity in Gaza. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  The Israelis say she was taken originally from the Nakhlos base on October 7th, and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=106.80000000000001s)]
*  ultimately she was freed and is in good condition. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  She was checked by medics and doctors last night and was able to be reunited with her [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=114.92s)]
*  family. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=119.36s)]
*  This comes as the Israelis are still trying to target key Hamas leadership inside Gaza. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=120.36s)]
*  They say they killed Nassim Abu Adjina, one of the men responsible for the October 7th [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=124.56s)]
*  massacre. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=130.0s)]
*  He was overseeing a Hamas brigade that came into the Erez area just north of Gaza, killing [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=131.0s)]
*  so many innocent civilians. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=136.64s)]
*  But this active front really gives you a sense of what the Israelis are facing, and later [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=138.6s)]
*  today we do anticipate we'll have more information to share about what exactly is going on inside [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=142.32s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=147.12s)]
*  This morning I met with Israel's Defense Minister Yoav Galant in Tel Aviv, and we talked [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=148.12s)]
*  about this situation, but given the sensitivity of what's unfolded over the past several hours, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=152.51999999999998s)]
*  we are holding some information until we're able to get that cleared and bring it to you. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=157.12s)]
*  Trey, can you tell us, from what you know, how is the Israeli cabinet holding together [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=162.0s)]
*  in terms of agreements, disagreements? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=169.08s)]
*  I'm sure that there's lots of tension that there had been before, but you start to see [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=172.52s)]
*  a little bit of that, and I'm wondering what that means for the war effort. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=182.44s)]
*  A few nights ago, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took to X, and he talked [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=186.0s)]
*  about the situation on the ground and sort of pointed the finger at a failure of intelligence [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=191.76000000000002s)]
*  from his intelligence chiefs that are still working in their positions. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=198.36s)]
*  Then he deleted the post and basically issued an apology, which is very rare from the prime [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=201.8s)]
*  minister, but it gave you a sense that there are some disagreements internally, but the [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=207.0s)]
*  one thing they all agree upon is this, and that is the efforts to destroy Hamas inside [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=212.28s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=217.32s)]
*  We listened there, as you can hear those protesters chanting in Washington, and it's interesting. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=218.95999999999998s)]
*  The political echelon here, they are aware of the protests around the world against Israel, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=225.0s)]
*  against the Jewish state, and against Israel's actions inside Gaza, and we've talked with [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=229.92s)]
*  a few top officials, and they raised this one question that's interesting in the context [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=234.04s)]
*  of all of this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=238.6s)]
*  They ask, why are the protesters chanting, ceasefire now, rather than free the hostages [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=239.6s)]
*  now? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=245.68s)]
*  Because their focus is on the 240 people that are still behind me inside Gaza being held [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=246.68s)]
*  by Hamas in the tunnels beneath the Strip, not on a ceasefire. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=252.2s)]
*  They say they will continue until they rescue those individuals and destroy Hamas. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=255.72s)]
*  What do you think that they'll be wanting to listen for in this hearing that we're monitoring [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=260.04s)]
*  where Secretary Antony Blinken and Lloyd Austin are both testifying in front of the Senate [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=264.76s)]
*  today? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=268.56s)]
*  You're likely going to hear more American support and a doubling down on what we've [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  seen already. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=276.76000000000005s)]
*  The American military presence in the region should not be understated, and it is part [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=278.28000000000003s)]
*  of the deterrence factor in all of this. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=283.04s)]
*  It is part of the reason that you're not seeing more direct involvement already by larger [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=284.88s)]
*  Iranian proxies like Hezbollah. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=290.02000000000004s)]
*  But we should note earlier today the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen say they fired one [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=292.28000000000003s)]
*  ballistic missile at least and multiple cruise missiles at Israel. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=297.64000000000004s)]
*  Missiles were sounding in the southern city of Elat that sits on the Red Sea, and the [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=301.76s)]
*  Israelis say they used for the first time in 25 days since this war began the Aero missile [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=305.76s)]
*  defense system. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=310.76s)]
*  The Iron Dome missile defense system normally will intercept rockets that are coming from [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=311.88s)]
*  Gaza, but for larger things like ballistic missiles, they have to use this broader system, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=315.44s)]
*  and it's a system that is more expensive to use. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=320.56s)]
*  It's a broader technology, and it's an indication that Israel's not just facing threats from [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=323.88s)]
*  Gaza and from Lebanon, but also as we saw earlier today from Yemen. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Ri0_p3U-Ik&t=328.96s)]
