# How America can respond to threats from Russia, China, and Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4)
*  Joining us now is former Secretary of State and former CIA Director Mike Pompeo. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to you, Mr. Secretary. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=5.2s)]
*  What do you make of Russia's announced new naval ambitions? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  Well, Trey, first of all, it's great to be with you. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=12.0s)]
*  Being with you brings a smile to my face. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=15.76s)]
*  Vladimir Putin does not bring a smile to my face, and his statement about America is just [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=18.96s)]
*  false. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  We don't present a threat to the people of Russia. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  The fact is he's conducted a war in Ukraine. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=26.92s)]
*  He's been on the coast. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=29.8s)]
*  He's done this in lots of places. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=31.560000000000002s)]
*  He's conducted assassinations around the world when, in fact, the United States presents [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=33.04s)]
*  no risk to Russia or the Russian people. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  So he's kind of got it backwards. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=39.72s)]
*  He's brought this on himself. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=41.24s)]
*  As for being a great naval power, the Russian Navy is not likely to pull that off. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=43.400000000000006s)]
*  We remain the great naval powers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=47.84s)]
*  Now sadly the case that the Chinese Communist Party has built out a naval force that is [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=49.8s)]
*  now threatening to be a rival for us in the Pacific. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=53.92s)]
*  Vladimir Putin's words today were very consistent with his history. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=57.839999999999996s)]
*  He has this grandiose vision, Trey, this grandiose vision that reminds him of the heyday of the [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=61.239999999999995s)]
*  Soviet Union, a place that Russia doesn't find itself today, is not likely to be again. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=66.0s)]
*  And yet his efforts, his efforts to try and make Russia great again, to build out the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=71.03999999999999s)]
*  old czarist empire, have really put a licking on his own people, put a real hurt on his [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=75.47999999999999s)]
*  own military, and frankly make it less likely that the Russian people will have a good sound [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=80.64s)]
*  economy, prosperity and security for themselves as well. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=84.76s)]
*  All right, Mr. Secretary, I'm going to switch around a lot, but you finished number one [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=89.28s)]
*  in your class, so I think you can follow me. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=93.12s)]
*  I want to talk about Brittany Griner and Paul Whelan. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=95.72s)]
*  You have been there. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  What how do you negotiate when it comes to Americans being held overseas and and whether [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=99.68s)]
*  or not to make a trade? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=105.72s)]
*  What are those conversations like? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=107.16000000000001s)]
*  So they're really tough, tough problems, Trey. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  It wore on my heart every single day as Secretary of State that we had Americans that were [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=114.32s)]
*  wrongfully detained in Russia with Paul Whelan was there on our watch. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=118.28s)]
*  In Iran, we had many. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=122.08s)]
*  We got a bunch of folks out of North Korea, but we weren't able to save Otto Warmbier. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=123.28s)]
*  This is something that every secretary of state and every president has to deal with. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=126.92s)]
*  These are hard problem sets. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=130.4s)]
*  When it comes to trades, there's a couple of rules. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=132.12s)]
*  One is the conversations need to be held in private. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=134.28s)]
*  You need to have these conversations in a way that don't jeopardize the risk of the [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=137.68s)]
*  people who are being held or allow them to be used as pawns by your adversaries. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=141.79999999999998s)]
*  Second, an express trade like the one that's being proposed is really dangerous. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  The guy that we offered up apparently is a bad guy who sipped arms around the world. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=149.88s)]
*  The two people who are being held by Vladimir Putin are civilians who who at most committed [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=155.32s)]
*  a misdemeanor. We ought not to be making trades of that nature. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  It's really dangerous because, Trey, you know this deal too, right? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=163.32s)]
*  Tomorrow we'll make this trade. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=166.64s)]
*  Everyone will celebrate. It will be fantastic to have Mr. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Wheeland and Ms. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=171.12s)]
*  Greiner back home. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=171.72s)]
*  But tomorrow or the day after, there'll be some other American who's held as a pawn to [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=173.08s)]
*  get back some bad guy, some criminal, some terrorist we're holding here in the United [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=177.36s)]
*  States. It is really risky to engage in trades of this nature. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=181.12s)]
*  I think this one won't make sense for America in the long run. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=184.0s)]
*  Let's switch to another adversary. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=188.4s)]
*  Speaker Pelosi may or may not visit Taiwan. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=190.08s)]
*  China is threatening U.S. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=192.76s)]
*  interest if she does. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=194.96s)]
*  Is a House speaker visiting Taiwan really what China envisions to start a third [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=196.28s)]
*  world war? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=202.36s)]
*  I don't think so. I think that's unlikely. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=205.72s)]
*  But the Chinese Communist Party has behaved in erratic ways of recent times. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=208.36s)]
*  And I think they also view the United States in a place today where you can move around [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=212.44s)]
*  the cabinet an awful lot and there'll be nothing that responds to you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=216.48s)]
*  Think of the 13 Americans that were killed in Afghanistan or the fact that our president [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=219.4s)]
*  said you could have a small invasion in Ukraine and that would be OK. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=224.16s)]
*  I think I think that risk the risk that we've lost the deterrent force, the power, the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=227.0s)]
*  good work that we did for four years increases the likelihood that she might use this as [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=231.76s)]
*  an excuse to do what he has long wanted to do. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=235.92s)]
*  We shouldn't underestimate that risk. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=238.68s)]
*  But at the same time, we shouldn't allow the Chinese Communist Party to issue a statement [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=240.4s)]
*  and tell American leaders where they can and can't go. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=244.68s)]
*  Taiwan is a independent sovereign nation. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=248.28s)]
*  And if Speaker Pelosi wants to go there and travel there, she ought to go there. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=250.88s)]
*  She certainly shouldn't change the plans of her trip because of something the Chinese [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=255.28s)]
*  put out in a press release. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=258.64s)]
*  All right. I will let you go with this. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=261.4s)]
*  You've been CIA director. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=262.92s)]
*  You've been a congressman from Kansas, number one in your class, secretary of state. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  There are only two jobs I can think of that are above the jobs you've had. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=268.68s)]
*  Fox News host or president of the United States. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=273.92s)]
*  If you were president, how would you deal with Iran? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=276.92s)]
*  What what what would look, I'm not trying to get you to announce anything, but obviously [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=282.12s)]
*  I have a lot of confidence in your foreign policy acumen. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  How would you deal with Iran? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=289.2s)]
*  Well, there are other great jobs, too. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=292.52s)]
*  You know that Trey Husband and Father rank right up there, too. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=294.24s)]
*  In terms of in terms of dealing with Iran, I think we had the right end of the stick. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=297.88s)]
*  The only way you can keep Iran from threatening Israel, threatening United States, is to deny [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=303.32s)]
*  them resources and money. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=307.6s)]
*  And we had done that. We'd put them in a really tough place. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=309.04s)]
*  The administration, this administration has already begun to not enforce the existing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=311.24s)]
*  sanctions. They haven't put any new sanctions in place. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=315.24s)]
*  Iran's economy will grow by something like six or eight percent this year, Trey. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=317.8s)]
*  That is devastatingly dangerous for the people in the Middle East, not just Israel, but the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=321.72s)]
*  Gulf states as well, and certainly presents risks to us. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=325.8s)]
*  The way you deal with them is straight up making it clear that you can't proceed down this [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=328.36s)]
*  path towards a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=332.12s)]
*  And we will put do everything we can within our power to deny you the economic resources [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  to do that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=337.92s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, one of my favorite colleagues. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=340.32s)]
*  And if you can keep a secret, don't tell Radcliffe. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=342.48s)]
*  I think you are my smartest colleague. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=344.84000000000003s)]
*  He thinks he was. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=347.64s)]
*  Keep that between us. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=349.56s)]
*  It's great to see you. I look forward to seeing you again soon. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=351.0s)]
*  Keep it between us. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=352.76s)]
*  John may be right about that. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=354.48s)]
*  Anyway, good to see you, Trey. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=355.8s)]
*  You too, Mike. Take care of yourself. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QsRyCbOiJC4&t=358.04s)]
