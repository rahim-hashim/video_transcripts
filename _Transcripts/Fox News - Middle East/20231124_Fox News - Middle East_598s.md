# Biden: Hamas doesn’t ‘give a damn’ about Palestinian civilians
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU)
*  Yesterday, families all across America gathered together with their loved ones and to give [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=0.0s)]
*  thanks. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=7.0s)]
*  We must be thankful for in America. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=8.32s)]
*  The food on our tables, the family and loved ones in our homes, and the many blessings [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=10.94s)]
*  that come from living in the greatest nation on earth. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=15.56s)]
*  Today, we can also be thankful for families being recruited and reunited with loved ones [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=18.32s)]
*  who have been held hostage for nearly 50 days. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  Beginning this morning under a deal reached by extensive U.S. diplomacy, including numerous [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=28.84s)]
*  calls I've made from the Oval Office to leaders across the region, fighting in Gaza will halt [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=33.84s)]
*  for four days. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=40.14s)]
*  This deal also is structured to allow a pause to continue for more than 50 hostages to be [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=42.2s)]
*  released. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  That's our goal. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  This morning, I've been engaged with my team as we began the first difficult days of implementing [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=51.4s)]
*  this deal. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=56.400000000000006s)]
*  It's only a start, but so far it's gone well. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=57.96s)]
*  Earlier this morning, 13 Israeli hostages were released, including an elderly woman, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  a grandmother, and mothers with their young children, some under the age of six years [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=66.6s)]
*  old. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=72.08s)]
*  Separately, several Thai nationals and Filipino nationals were also kidnapped by Hamas on [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=73.08s)]
*  the 7th. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=78.56s)]
*  They were released as well. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=79.56s)]
*  All of these hostages have been through a terrible ordeal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=81.56s)]
*  And this is the beginning of a long journey of healing for them. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=84.8s)]
*  The teddy bears waiting to greet those children at the hospital are a stark reminder of the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=88.91999999999999s)]
*  trauma these children have been through at such a very young age. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  Jill and I, your children with me, are keeping them all in our prayers today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=99.52s)]
*  Today has been a product of a lot of hard work and weeks of personal engagement. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=104.0s)]
*  From the moment Hamas kidnapped these people, I, along with my team, have worked around [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=109.32s)]
*  the clock to secure the release. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=113.5s)]
*  We saw the first result of this effort with the release of two American hostages in late [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=115.94s)]
*  October, followed by the release of two Israeli hostages. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=120.38s)]
*  I've consistently pressed for a pause in the fighting for two reasons, to accelerate and [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=124.66s)]
*  expand humanitarian assistance going into Gaza, and two, to facilitate the release of [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=129.9s)]
*  hostages. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=135.14s)]
*  And over the past several weeks, I've spoken repeatedly with the Emir of Qatar, the President [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=136.14s)]
*  of the United States, and the Sisi of Egypt, and Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=141.62s)]
*  help secure this deal, to nail it down. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=145.38s)]
*  And I want to thank all three leaders for their personal partnership to get this done. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=147.74s)]
*  I spoke with the Emir and President al-Sisi and the Prime Minister Netanyahu again on [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=152.74s)]
*  Wednesday to confirm the elements of the engagement. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=157.38s)]
*  As I said, today's release are the start of a process. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=161.02s)]
*  We expect more hostages to be released tomorrow, and more the day after, and more the day after [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=165.94s)]
*  that. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=170.38s)]
*  Over the next few days, we expect that dozens of hostages will be returned to their families. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=171.78s)]
*  We also remember all those who are still being held, and renew our commitment to work for [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=176.7s)]
*  their release as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=180.9s)]
*  Two American women and one four-year-old child, Abigail, who remains among those missing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=182.9s)]
*  We also will not stop until we get these hostages brought home and an answer to their [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=189.57999999999998s)]
*  whereabouts. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=194.66s)]
*  I remain in personal contact with the leaders of Qatar, Egypt and Israel to make sure this [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=195.94s)]
*  stays on track and every aspect of the deal is implemented. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=201.1s)]
*  You know, this extended pause in the fighting brings a critical opportunity to deliver much [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=206.18s)]
*  needed food, medicine, water and fuel to the civilians in Gaza, and we are not wasting [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=210.88s)]
*  one single minute. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=217.44s)]
*  Since my trip to Israel last month, I've been focused on accelerating the delivery [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=219.34s)]
*  of humanitarian assistance to Gaza in coordination with the United Nations and the Red Cross. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=223.23999999999998s)]
*  I just spoke with my special envoy for the Middle East humanitarian initiative, David [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=229.39999999999998s)]
*  Satterfield, for an update, and I've asked him to monitor our progress hour by hour and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=233.44s)]
*  keep me personally informed. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=238.79999999999998s)]
*  From the beginning, we put in place mechanisms to prevent Hamas from diverting these supplies, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=240.48s)]
*  and we're continuing that effort to make sure aid gets to the people who need it. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=247.6s)]
*  More than 200 trucks arrived at the crossing point in Egypt and in Gaza today. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=253.6s)]
*  These trucks carry food and medicine, as well as fuel, fuel and cooking gas. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=258.24s)]
*  The fuel will be used not only to power the trucks delivering these life-saving supplies, [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=263.82s)]
*  but for desalination, for water wells, for hospitals and for bakeries. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=268.9s)]
*  And hundreds more trucks are getting in position as well, ready to enter Gaza over the coming [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=275.2s)]
*  days to support the innocent Palestinians who are suffering greatly because of this [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=279.94s)]
*  war that Hamas has unleashed. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=284.44s)]
*  Hamas doesn't give a damn about them. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=287.12s)]
*  We also look to the future. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=289.88s)]
*  As we look to the future, we have to end this cycle of violence in the Middle East. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=291.52s)]
*  We need to renew our resolve to pursue this two-state solution where Israelis and Palestinians [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=295.8s)]
*  can one day live side by side in a two-state solution. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=300.74s)]
*  With equal measure of freedom and dignity. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=304.94s)]
*  Two states for two peoples. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=307.38s)]
*  And it's more important now than ever. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=310.16s)]
*  Hamas unleashed this terrorist attack because they fear nothing more than Israelis and Palestinians [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=312.21999999999997s)]
*  living side by side in peace. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=317.86s)]
*  You know, to continue down the path of terror and violence and killing and war is to give [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=321.14s)]
*  Hamas what they seek. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=325.86s)]
*  And we can't do that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=327.5s)]
*  So today, let's continue to be thankful for all the families who are now and those [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=329.78s)]
*  who will soon be brought together again. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=335.7s)]
*  And I want to once again thank the Emir of Qatar, President Sisi of Egypt and Prime Minister [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=338.21999999999997s)]
*  Netanyahu for their partnership to make what we've done so far possible. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=343.9s)]
*  And for their continued leadership as we all keep working to implement this deal. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=348.34s)]
*  And over the coming days, I'll remain engaged with leaders throughout the Middle East as [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=353.26s)]
*  we all work together to build a better future for the region. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=358.8s)]
*  A future where this kind of violence is unthinkable. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=361.84s)]
*  A future where all children in the region, every child, Jewish, Muslim, Christian, Israeli, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=366.08s)]
*  Palestinian, Arab, grow up knowing only peace. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=371.24s)]
*  That's what we do. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=375.68s)]
*  We're waiting now. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=376.68s)]
*  We have just a matter of, I thought, maybe even as soon as by the time I got here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=377.68s)]
*  But in the next hour or so, we'll know what the second wave of releases are. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=382.44s)]
*  And I'm hopeful that as we anticipate. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=386.32s)]
*  So thank you all for listening. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=389.96s)]
*  I'll take a few questions. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=391.52s)]
*  Mr. President, when will the first American hostages be released and some more included today? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=392.8s)]
*  We don't know when that will occur, but we're going to be expected to occur. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=398.6s)]
*  And we don't know what the list of all the hostages are and when they'll be released. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=402.96s)]
*  But we know the numbers, they're going to be released. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=407.6s)]
*  So my hope and expectation will be soon. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=410.44s)]
*  And of the 10 Americans that are unaccounted for, do you know all of their conditions? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=412.84s)]
*  Are they all alive? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=416.88s)]
*  We don't know all of their conditions. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=417.88s)]
*  Mr. President, how long do you expect this war is going to take? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=419.88s)]
*  And have you encouraged Prime Minister Netanyahu to accept a timeline saved by the other two? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=422.88s)]
*  I've encouraged the prime minister to. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=429.44s)]
*  To focus on trying to reduce the number of casualties while he is attempting to eliminate [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=438.08s)]
*  Hamas, which is a legitimate objective. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=446.2s)]
*  That's a difficult task. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=449.88s)]
*  And I don't know how long it will take. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=451.96s)]
*  My expectation and hope is that as we move forward, the rest of the Arab world and the [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=455.64s)]
*  region is also putting pressure on all sides to slow this down, to bring this to an end [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=460.15999999999997s)]
*  as quickly as we can. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, do you think the chances of this troops to be extended by a few days or [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=468.03999999999996s)]
*  more? [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=473.03999999999996s)]
*  I think the chances are real. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=474.15999999999997s)]
*  Mr. President, there are members of your party who would like to see conditions placed on [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=476.15999999999997s)]
*  82 Israel. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=480.15999999999997s)]
*  What is your view on that? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=481.15999999999997s)]
*  They would like to see, you know, a reduction in the bombing. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=482.68s)]
*  Well, I think that's a worthwhile thought. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=487.68s)]
*  But I don't think if I started off with that, we'd ever gotten to where we are today. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=491.76000000000005s)]
*  We have to take this a piece of the time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=495.04s)]
*  Mr. President, do you trust Hamas to up the barricade? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=497.56s)]
*  I don't trust Hamas to do anything right. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=501.12s)]
*  I only trust Hamas to respond to pressure. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=504.56s)]
*  Mr. President, you said you were hoping to get cooperation from Arab leaders. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=506.56s)]
*  I'm hearing a lot, but I'm not going to speak to it right now. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=511.96s)]
*  There's an overwhelming desire on the part of the region to let me back up. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=517.96s)]
*  I cannot prove what I'm about to say, but I believe one of the reasons why Hamas struck [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=524.96s)]
*  when they did was they knew that I was working very closely with the Saudis and others in [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=530.36s)]
*  the region to bring peace to the region by having recognition of Israel and Israel's [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=536.08s)]
*  right to exist. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=541.88s)]
*  You may recall when we did the G-20 a little while ago, I was able to get a resolution, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=543.36s)]
*  a statement passed through there saying we're going to build a railroad from Riyadh all [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=549.4000000000001s)]
*  the way through the Middle East into Saudi Arabia, Israel, et cetera, and all the way [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=554.2800000000001s)]
*  up to Europe. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=558.84s)]
*  Not the railroad, but it would be an underground pipeline and then railroad. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=560.2800000000001s)]
*  The whole idea is there's overwhelming interest, and I think most Arab nations know it, in [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=564.68s)]
*  coordinating with one another to change the dynamic in their region for a longer-term [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LF2x0UhdxU&t=569.8s)]
