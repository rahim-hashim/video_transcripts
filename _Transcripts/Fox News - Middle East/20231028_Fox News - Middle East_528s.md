# An inside look at Iran's exportation of terror
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU)
*  U.S. airstrikes hitting key targets linked to Iranian-backed terror groups this week, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=0.0s)]
*  as the Pentagon reveals that the regime's proxy forces have mounted at least 20 attacks [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=5.12s)]
*  on U.S. bases and personnel since October 17th. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=10.52s)]
*  It's a lot of red dots, a lot of attacks, a lot of land to cover, but this is far from [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=14.620000000000001s)]
*  the first time they've hit U.S. targets, of course, through these proxy groups. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=18.56s)]
*  Let's go off the wall and examine how Iran's infamous Revolutionary Guard Corps, which [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=23.0s)]
*  orchestrates proxy attacks, or an arm of it does, expanded their terror network across [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=27.8s)]
*  the globe. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=32.52s)]
*  So when you look at this map, here's Iran, there's Israel, U.S. maintains bases in the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=33.52s)]
*  north of Iraq and southeast Syria, all of which in the last 20 days at some level will [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=38.24s)]
*  have been targets of Iranian-backed groups. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=43.16s)]
*  And I think what's important is before these last 20 days, it was quiet. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=45.68s)]
*  For almost six months, none of this. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=51.06s)]
*  So this has been an explosion of attacks just since the war in Israel began. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=53.24s)]
*  Say what you want, whether these troops should be here, per se, but if Iran wants to fund [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=56.64s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon, they've got to go through Syria and Iraq, which is part of the reason [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=61.68s)]
*  why those bases are positioned where they are, in addition to oil fields and other dynamics. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=66.52s)]
*  So we talk a lot about Iran being behind Hamas or other proxies around the globe, those that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=70.76s)]
*  are perpetrating the attacks before you. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=77.32s)]
*  So let's talk about how Iran does so. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=79.44s)]
*  Let's begin with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=81.64s)]
*  Now it's an independent branch of the Iranian Armed Forces. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=85.28s)]
*  It was originally designed, and it's always the one that is referenced when it comes to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=90.44s)]
*  terror, but it was originally designed by the mullahs after the revolution in Iran in [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=93.96000000000001s)]
*  1979 to protect the mullahs from ever losing power. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=98.6s)]
*  Correct, because there were multiple coups in Iran, and once the Islamists took over, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=102.0s)]
*  they didn't want that to happen to them. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=106.44s)]
*  So there's a standing army in Iran, and then there's the IRGC, which is meant to protect [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=108.28s)]
*  the House of Khomeini and those that have took over because there was after the revolution [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=113.52s)]
*  in 73. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=118.16s)]
*  In 52 there was a coup, Americans put in the Shah, the Shah was friendly to the West, even [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=119.16s)]
*  friendly to Israel. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=124.08s)]
*  Once the Iranian Revolutionary, the revolution happened in 73, they said this isn't going [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=125.56s)]
*  to happen again, so they created their own military. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=130.56s)]
*  So what began as sort of a secret police or a secret service has evolved over time, and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=132.32s)]
*  the big inflection point of that evolution was the 1980 to 1988 Iran-Iraq War, where [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=138.52s)]
*  they began to take on more military responsibilities. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=144.28s)]
*  Today the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has essentially an air force, an army, a navy, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=147.4s)]
*  and their own intelligence service as well, where it's, as we point out, an independent [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=154.12s)]
*  army within an army. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=158.56s)]
*  The most powerful army inside that expansive country. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=160.0s)]
*  By the way, ironically in that Iran-Iraq War, we were allied with Iraq fighting against [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=164.08s)]
*  Iran. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=169.56s)]
*  So this is a very complex story, and we're ultimately just sticking to the Iranian portion [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=170.56s)]
*  of it and what they're trying to meddle and do in the world. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=175.44s)]
*  So in that Iran-Iraq War, Will, you started to see an expansion of the IRGC's role, not [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  just protecting at home, but exporting the views of revolution. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=184.24s)]
*  Yeah, so we talk about Hamas, we talk about Hezbollah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=188.6s)]
*  The group that you often hear reference is the Quds Force. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=194.16s)]
*  This became active during the Lebanese Civil War, and they set up bases throughout the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=197.35999999999999s)]
*  Middle East, now in Afghanistan, beyond the Middle East, over to Afghanistan, back over [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=202.0s)]
*  to Iraq, Lebanon, and as we know now, helping Hamas in Gaza and the West Bank. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=206.56s)]
*  The Quds Force is formally their expeditory force. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=212.28s)]
*  If they want to export Islamic views and values, they do it through that arm. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=215.44s)]
*  It started in destabilizing Lebanon, which is what created the opportunity for Hezbollah, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=220.04s)]
*  which is the most powerful force north of Israel, but also in Afghanistan, Iraq. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=224.28s)]
*  We're going to lay out some examples shortly of how the Quds Force tried to foment this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=228.56s)]
*  Shia Islamist view of the world in a neighborhood almost exclusively that's Sunni Muslim. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=233.6s)]
*  Yeah, and I corrected myself from it being exclusively focused on the Middle East, as [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=239.04s)]
*  you can see here. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=243.24s)]
*  Pakistan, Afghanistan, another group that we don't often talk about enough is the Houthis [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=244.24s)]
*  in Yemen, where there's been a civil war going on there for quite some time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=248.24s)]
*  That's an offshoot of Shiite Islam. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=251.46s)]
*  Really the only Sunni group is Hamas in Gaza that's affiliated with the Quds in the Iranian [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  Revolutionary Guard. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=260.52s)]
*  The only Sunni group is Hamas in the West Bank and in Gaza that is aligned strategically [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=261.52s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=265.96000000000004s)]
*  Otherwise, they're trying to empower Shia militia forces. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=266.96000000000004s)]
*  Iraq right here, we'll talk about that in the Iraq War. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=270.2s)]
*  And Syria where they've allied with the dictator there as well. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  And all of it is to stand up against, in large part, Saudi Arabia and that block of Arab [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  Sunni states, which might be why this war started in the first place. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=281.94000000000005s)]
*  Because Saudi Arabia was drawing closer to Israel, Iran couldn't tolerate that. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=285.88000000000005s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=289.44000000000005s)]
*  The suspicion is they launched this attack to get an Israeli over-response that would [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=290.44000000000005s)]
*  distance themselves from Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=295.68s)]
*  We might be seeing that as we speak. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=298.46000000000004s)]
*  Take a look at the attacks that have been conducted dating back to 1983 or so under [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=302.0s)]
*  the banner or at least under the funding of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and the Quds [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  force. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=312.72s)]
*  Starting with, you remember probably 1983, the Beirut bombings, the barracks of U.S. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=313.72s)]
*  Marines as well as the French barracks as well in Beirut, Lebanon. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=318.84000000000003s)]
*  And one of Reagan's regrets later on was leaving right after that, which sent a signal [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=324.64s)]
*  to the Iranian Quds force, hey, when we bomb, when we strike, the Americans flee. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=329.78s)]
*  So they've continued to do that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=334.85999999999996s)]
*  Qobar towers bombing in Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=335.97999999999996s)]
*  This is to your point about the rivalry with Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=338.02s)]
*  It was American forces that were killed but Saudis as well. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=342.02s)]
*  Saudis, yeah. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=345.3s)]
*  And this is a big one for those of us in the post-911 generation, fought in Iraq. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=346.29999999999995s)]
*  A lot of the equipment supplied inside Iraq was supplied by the Quds force, by Iranian-backed [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=350.53999999999996s)]
*  militias, EFPs, explosively formed penetrators. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=356.02s)]
*  I was there when we started to learn about this tactic, so sophisticated that it wasn't [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=359.5s)]
*  being created by someone in their backyard. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=364.62s)]
*  It had to have regime support and it was clear it was the Iranians. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=367.82s)]
*  So a good 20 percent of deaths of Americans during a certain time period were coming from [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=371.58s)]
*  Iran. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=376.02s)]
*  Yes, that seems so overt that it's undeniable. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=377.02s)]
*  And then of course we did again mention the Saudis. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=379.34s)]
*  There was the bomb plot intended to kill the Saudi ambassador to the United States in Washington, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  D.C. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=385.62s)]
*  That plot was foiled but again highlighting the rivalry in the Middle East between the [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=386.62s)]
*  Saudis and the Iranians. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=390.5s)]
*  And you know we were talking about hostages this morning. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=391.5s)]
*  I mean this is a regime premised on hostage taking. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=394.14s)]
*  If you remember, in 1979, they took those U.S. hostages from the embassy, from the university, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=396.66s)]
*  that ultimately became a big part of Jimmy Carter's downfall. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=403.02s)]
*  I mean they used those hostages to leverage defense of their... [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=405.5s)]
*  This is a bit of history but let's also show you really quickly the role they're playing [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=408.46s)]
*  sort of in the modern era. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=411.58s)]
*  Hassan Soleimani was the head of the Quds Force in Iran. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=413.54s)]
*  He was helping Syrian President Bashar al-Assad stay in power. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=417.34s)]
*  So again the IRGC exporting through the Quds Force not just terror but military might to [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=421.74s)]
*  help a regime, this time in Syria. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=429.18s)]
*  Yeah, this is regime protection. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=431.5s)]
*  Bashar al-Assad wants to stay in power so he allies with Soleimani in Iran in order [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=433.38s)]
*  to back him up. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=437.42s)]
*  Will, you mentioned... [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9FRiiU9ikdU&t=438.42s)]
