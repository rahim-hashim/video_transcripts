# Tlaib accused of 'tripling down' on false Gaza blast claims
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs)
*  The U.S. is worried that the IDF is not ready to go with achievable plans for Gaza like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=0.0s)]
*  the day after. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=6.72s)]
*  Who's reporting that? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=7.72s)]
*  Do you believe that? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=8.72s)]
*  Well, dear, Jerry. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=9.72s)]
*  Because I feel like IDF, all we've heard is how powerful they are. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=10.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=13.16s)]
*  And then I have a three-star general advising them for this insurgency. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=14.16s)]
*  The Marine General is not going to be there long. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=17.84s)]
*  So I don't know. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=19.92s)]
*  I always thought that Israel wrote the book on things like this and that we were getting [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=20.92s)]
*  during the years in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=26.5s)]
*  But we could just go by what's going on behind closed doors. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=28.86s)]
*  So far, it seems we seem to be keeping a tight leash on them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=33.0s)]
*  You know, Trey is right, though, because there are these stories with different kind of angles. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=36.36s)]
*  You got the New York Times. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=40.92s)]
*  It says that essentially Israeli officials have not yet decided whether or not to launch [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=41.92s)]
*  the surgical attack or the ground, you know, the ground invasion. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=47.879999999999995s)]
*  At the same time, Israel is saying that they are well prepared for the ground assault. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=52.64s)]
*  And then you've got the Washington Post saying they're talking about getting all the Americans [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=57.64s)]
*  out if this thing goes sideways. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  So I think it's important to also note that we're not talking about that Israel are some [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=63.82s)]
*  scrubs off the street that have never fought before. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=69.6s)]
*  They have been training with Americans, special operations, as well as generals have been [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=72.16s)]
*  on the ground for years. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=76.42s)]
*  This is not anything new. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=78.92s)]
*  We're not talking about people that don't know how to battle. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=80.22s)]
*  I think it's also important to note that the administration is split on strategy, not only [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=83.26s)]
*  from a diplomacy standpoint, but from how they should strike. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=87.78s)]
*  And it's very interesting that you have people that are openly leaking and the administration [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=91.94s)]
*  to somehow, Brian, I think pressure Israel to the left side and not to take action on [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=96.25999999999999s)]
*  the ground. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=102.38s)]
*  So I think some of this reporting we have to take with a grain of salt because of the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=103.38s)]
*  people that are leaking the information. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=106.66s)]
*  I think ultimately, though, what they're doing with the administration is saying, hey, Israel's [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=108.02s)]
*  going to take their time because we want to negotiate for hostages because there are all [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=111.74s)]
*  those 220 hostages somewhere, they think, and it's all about the hostages right now. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=116.14s)]
*  Yeah, do they delay ground troops because there are 220 hostages there and we want them [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=120.97999999999999s)]
*  all to come out safely? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=125.86s)]
*  But once if they do release all 220, they're not going to do that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=127.69999999999999s)]
*  They're not going to do it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=131.62s)]
*  If they did, they know then Israel goes in. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=132.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=134.34s)]
*  Way more hostages than they thought in court of those battle plans. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=135.66s)]
*  Jack Reed is one of the people, Republican, excuse me, Democrat, who says, let's delay [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=138.06s)]
*  for more hostage release. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=142.22s)]
*  But we delay in the public sentiment because it tends to go against Israel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=143.9s)]
*  And the longer you delay, the more distant October 7th seems. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=147.86s)]
*  That's why they're bringing out all these personal stories. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=151.74s)]
*  We'll see where it goes. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=153.78s)]
*  But the other thing is you could also find out intelligence where the hostages are and [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=155.66s)]
*  maybe try to grab them in an operation. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=159.22s)]
*  Have you all heard anything about why it took so long for IDF or for their military [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=161.74s)]
*  to respond to these kibbutz's that were annihilated? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=166.14000000000001s)]
*  No, that's for the investigation. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=168.9s)]
*  Some of them said nine, it took like nine hours. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=170.94s)]
*  And how did this even happen? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=174.3s)]
*  How were they able to come over the border? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=177.06s)]
*  Paragliders? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=180.02s)]
*  Well, the prime minister was under a lot of pressure. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=181.02s)]
*  They've been trailing and rehearing, they've been training and rehearsing for this for at [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=182.9s)]
*  least a year. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=185.58s)]
*  In a Hamas terrorist video that was taken off one of the body cams, they played it for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=187.42000000000002s)]
*  reporters like Trey yesterday. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=192.14000000000001s)]
*  And apparently the plan had been to take over towns they attacked and hold positions once [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=194.22000000000003s)]
*  they killed and kidnapped the residents. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=199.46s)]
*  And I mentioned this a moment ago. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=202.20000000000002s)]
*  One terrorist told Israeli forces, whoever brings a hostage back to Gaza gets $10,000 [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=203.98000000000002s)]
*  and an apartment. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=210.58s)]
*  The big question is, is that apartment still standing? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=211.82000000000002s)]
*  You can't forget who these people are. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=214.82s)]
*  We're talking ceasefire, some are holding up ceasefire signs at some of these protests. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=216.78s)]
*  Our president is saying, let's focus on getting the hostages back, but possibly a ceasefire. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=220.78s)]
*  No, these are these are the brutal individuals. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=225.26s)]
*  They are evil. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=229.06s)]
*  Think about what they did to these women, to these children, to the elderly. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=230.22s)]
*  It's impossible to do that to a human being unless you were evil. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=234.1s)]
*  So the US has been hit by Iran militants twice, three times in the last four days in Iraq. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=237.39999999999998s)]
*  We had our destroyer go into off the coast of Yemen and have rockets fired at it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=244.42s)]
*  We had to knock them down. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  And then over in Syria, our bases have been hit pretty consistently. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=251.33999999999997s)]
*  No one can believe that we are not answering this back. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  We're not only blocking, we're only blocking this. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=257.94s)]
*  We had one guy die of a heart attack, they say over in Syria after the attack, but we're [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=260.65999999999997s)]
*  doing nothing. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=265.09999999999997s)]
*  As Jack Keane said last hour, we've been attacked 90 times over the last two years. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=266.09999999999997s)]
*  We responded four times. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=270.84s)]
*  That is a joke. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=272.74s)]
*  We have that soundbite from your interview with Jack Keane. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  We've been in a defensive mode. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=278.62s)]
*  In other words, somebody shoots at this, we try to shoot back, they defeat whatever that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=280.54s)]
*  is. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=284.02s)]
*  Obviously, that's what we must do. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=285.02s)]
*  But what we need to do is deter them from conducting these attacks. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=286.62s)]
*  And there's been almost 90 attacks in our bases in Iraq and Syria since this administration [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=292.02s)]
*  took office. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=298.42s)]
*  And we've only responded a half a dozen times. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=299.42s)]
*  It's not surprising they're still coming after us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=302.34s)]
*  We've got to go on the offense. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=305.41999999999996s)]
*  We're not starting World War III. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=306.65999999999997s)]
*  We don't need the hand-wringers out there interpreting that. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=308.17999999999995s)]
*  We're talking about protecting American lives that are overseas. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  And it's not just enough to shoot at a drone that's shooting at you or to shoot at an incoming [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=316.17999999999995s)]
*  missile. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=321.62s)]
*  We've got to take away the capability for them to do that. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=322.62s)]
*  And Admiral Kirby came out yesterday and says, we will respond at a time of our choosing. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=325.02s)]
*  We're waiting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=329.38s)]
*  It's been two and a half years. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=330.38s)]
*  And to your point, Brian, since January the 21st, there's been 86 attacks on U.S. forces. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=332.5s)]
*  They've only responded four times. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=338.54s)]
*  And I think the administration position is posture. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=340.3s)]
*  But you can posture all day. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=342.98s)]
*  But if you don't actually act, the posture means nothing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=344.62s)]
*  Imagine if you have a family member at one of these bases. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  And then Rashida Tlaib, you all heard what she said, the congresswoman, she's tripling [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=349.82s)]
*  down again. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=353.54s)]
*  She is still doubting that the hospital thing happened within Gaza. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=354.7s)]
*  She says Israel did it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=359.42s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=360.42s)]
*  Because she actually repeated what Hamas had said. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=362.1s)]
*  There's so much evidence to prove that it was the Islamic Jihad. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=365.1s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=370.98s)]
*  And the U.S. Intel, Israeli Intel, they have provided information. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=371.98s)]
*  It shows the video of where apparently an Islamic Jihad person inside the Palestinian [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=375.42s)]
*  area, shot off a rocket, wound up essentially hitting the parking lot at a hospital. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=382.06s)]
*  But of course the headline immediately out of Hamas was they killed 500 people. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=390.38s)]
*  Well for the most part, that number reportedly is much lower. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=394.74s)]
*  But she is sticking with her story that we need to have an independent investigation, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=398.86s)]
*  she says, because that's what the United Nations is saying. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  We've already had our investigation. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=409.22s)]
*  The Defense Department briefed the president, they briefed congress as well, and they came [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=411.5s)]
*  up with their own independent analysis as well. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=415.82s)]
*  She says don't believe them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=417.86s)]
*  She prefers Hamas talking points, but it's not just Talib. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=419.24s)]
*  There's a little bit of little Talibs all in the State Department. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=422.32s)]
*  AOC. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=425.76s)]
*  This is what Huffington Post is reporting. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=426.76s)]
*  There's basically a mutiny brewing within the State Department at all levels. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=428.44s)]
*  And the State Department is prepared, some of the State Department, are prepared to release [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=432.88s)]
*  a dissent cable against their own government. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=437.84000000000003s)]
*  So these are a bunch of State Department officials. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=440.92s)]
*  The president is supposed to set foreign policies, and they're saying openly they disagree with [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=442.88s)]
*  the president of the United States. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=447.88s)]
*  She is sympathizing with the terrorists too. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=449.91999999999996s)]
*  She said war crimes don't justify war crimes. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=451.56s)]
*  And I'm like, someone comes into your house and kills your entire family, you're not allowed [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=454.24s)]
*  to respond back. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=458.15999999999997s)]
*  The New York Times about the hospital incident, they admitted, quote, we relied too heavily [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=459.88s)]
*  on claims by Hamas about the hospital blast. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=464.36s)]
*  And then the AP reporters are not even allowed, and they're reporting, to say that Hamas is [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=467.28s)]
*  a terrorist organization. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=471.96s)]
*  But you know, the New York Times, but the New York Times also, they are culpable, they [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=472.96s)]
*  apologize. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=476.64s)]
*  They're the headline. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=478.2s)]
*  Israel strike kills hundreds in hospital, Palestinians say. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=479.2s)]
*  Meanwhile that goes out there. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=482.91999999999996s)]
*  It got tons of views. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=484.47999999999996s)]
*  That becomes a series of riots. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=486.56s)]
*  The president of the United States gets his meetings canceled with Jordan, Egypt, and [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=489.28s)]
*  the Palestinian Authority. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=493.71999999999997s)]
*  And it turns out it's erroneous. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=494.71999999999997s)]
*  The videos provided, the intercepts are there for you to hear Islamic Jihad said, where [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  are you shooting from the cemetery? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=501.4s)]
*  What did you just hit? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=503.08s)]
*  Also, the hospital is still standing. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=504.08s)]
*  They hit the parking lot. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=506.0s)]
*  You don't hit the parking lot from the. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=507.6s)]
*  And if you hit a parking lot to 500 people die? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=510.08000000000004s)]
*  No. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=512.2s)]
*  There was no crater. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=513.2s)]
*  But the thing is too, fundamentally this, nobody, Israel is not aiming for civilians. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=514.2s)]
*  Hamas is. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=519.5600000000001s)]
*  They are trying to kill them, dismember them, or they take them hostage. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=520.5600000000001s)]
*  Hamas is also using the civilians as shields. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=524.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=528.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what they did. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=529.0s)]
*  I mean, we just can't discount that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=530.0s)]
*  And Israel said go south. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=531.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=532.0s)]
*  That's why they said bring hostages, and we'll give you $10,000. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=533.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=535.32s)]
*  Because that is their protection. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=536.32s)]
*  That's a big difference. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=537.56s)]
*  Alright. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=talKILfbYRs&t=538.56s)]
