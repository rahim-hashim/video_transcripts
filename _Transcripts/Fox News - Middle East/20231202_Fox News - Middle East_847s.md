# Mark Levin: This shouldn't shock you
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU)
*  I want to set the stage. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=0.0s)]
*  Many of you are perplexed and confounded when you hear Joe Biden talk about how he [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=1.08s)]
*  supports Israel and yet how he makes other statements undermining Israel, how [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=5.26s)]
*  his secretary of state and national security advisor are working full time [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=10.88s)]
*  to undermine Israel as well. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=15.76s)]
*  It gets back to the United States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=17.72s)]
*  It gets back to American Marxism. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=19.62s)]
*  It all gets back to this book. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=21.72s)]
*  Let's start with our own border. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=24.96s)]
*  This will provide some perspective. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=26.36s)]
*  Why is our border wide open? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=28.68s)]
*  Why is our border wide open? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=32.08s)]
*  Yes, to turn Texas blue, but really with all the inhumanity and mayhem that's [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=33.44s)]
*  taking place on the border, the hundreds of thousands of Americans who've died [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=39.24s)]
*  during the course of the Biden administration through fentanyl and other [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=44.120000000000005s)]
*  activities, allowing Mexican gangs to get footholds in our cities to allow the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  drug cartels to have footholds in every major metropolitan area in every state [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=54.52s)]
*  in the union, to overrun our school systems, to overrun our law enforcement, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=58.44s)]
*  to overrun our towns. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=63.480000000000004s)]
*  What kind of a president, what kind of administration would do this [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=66.4s)]
*  intentionally, purposely to their own country, to their own people? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=69.48s)]
*  It will be an administration that is so radicalized, so radicalized that if you [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=76.52s)]
*  use America as an illegitimate country, certainly parts of America as [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=82.24s)]
*  illegitimate as American. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=88.88s)]
*  What am I talking about? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=92.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, if you read American Marxism, you would know that there's a whole school [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=93.08s)]
*  of Marxist thought out there that says California, Texas, most of the West, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  Arizona, New Mexico, they don't belong to the United States. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=104.08s)]
*  They don't belong to quote unquote, the white Europeans, the white [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=107.8s)]
*  Europeans who came to the United States, conquered parts of the United States, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=111.44s)]
*  were pioneers in the United States, that these lands were taken by a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=117.60000000000001s)]
*  colonialistic, imperialistic white European majority eventually that took [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=122.68s)]
*  these lands from the Mexicans, took these lands from Native Americans and so [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=129.88s)]
*  forth and so on. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=134.72s)]
*  So why shouldn't the border be open? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=135.44s)]
*  There's no such thing. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=137.76s)]
*  This is what they're taught. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=138.92000000000002s)]
*  This is what people are hearing in our college campuses and scholarship. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=139.96s)]
*  It's not me just discerning this. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=145.28s)]
*  It's them. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=146.8s)]
*  There's no such thing as an illegal alien, unless you want to consider the [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=148.48000000000002s)]
*  white European settlers in the United States as illegal aliens because they [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=151.68s)]
*  don't belong here. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=155.88s)]
*  And so this mentality obviously is widespread in the Biden administration [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=157.68s)]
*  because the Biden administration is really the third term of the Obama [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=164.88s)]
*  administration. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  And Obama was in many respects an American hating, Israel hating radical [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  in many respects. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=174.92s)]
*  And he unleashed these movements. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=175.95999999999998s)]
*  Many of them certainly gave them impetus during the course of his [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=177.76s)]
*  presidency and appointed people who are very, very radical. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=181.88s)]
*  And I believe this is exactly what's going on on the southern border. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=186.48s)]
*  So it doesn't matter how many American citizens die. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=190.0s)]
*  It doesn't matter how many American citizens are on fentanyl and have the [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=193.2s)]
*  effects of fentanyl. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=197.96s)]
*  It just doesn't matter what's going on on the southern border. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  This is a realignment. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=201.0s)]
*  How can you talk about American sovereignty and American borders when [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=203.8s)]
*  America stole these lands? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=206.72s)]
*  You see what I'm getting at? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=210.56s)]
*  Now let's go to Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=213.56s)]
*  Now the fact that the Jews are the indigenous peoples of Judean Samaria, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  which they wrongly call the West Bank of Jordan. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=223.32s)]
*  Jordan didn't even exist. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=226.12s)]
*  And the fact that the state of Israel, slightly over 75 years ago, was [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  established in the areas that belonged to the Jews for thousands of thousands of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=233.6s)]
*  years, many of the people who came back to that part of the world, particularly [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=238.96s)]
*  after the Holocaust became white Europeans, you see. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=244.72s)]
*  So the Jews are white Europeans. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=251.24s)]
*  They're no different than the Americans in the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=253.0s)]
*  According to this ideology, they come back and whether it's the Ottoman Empire, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=257.08s)]
*  whether it's the British, the Liga nations, the United Nations, and here they are, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=264.64s)]
*  they're carved out this little piece of land. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=268.4s)]
*  And then it expands in 1967, that war, and then the Yom Kippur War and other wars [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=272.36s)]
*  that followed, and now they're occupiers. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=278.12s)]
*  Now they're occupying land that doesn't belong to them. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=282.8s)]
*  I mean, after all, these are really white European individuals, just like in America. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=285.76s)]
*  And just like America, they're imperialistic and they're colonialistic. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=292.96000000000004s)]
*  They took land from and are oppressing non-white people, brown people. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=298.40000000000003s)]
*  I'm telling you the mentality, just like in the United States. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=303.96000000000004s)]
*  And so Israel's borders are not legitimate. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=308.44s)]
*  And Israel, like the United States, is now a militaristic power. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=311.56s)]
*  And it's able to hold on to these ill-begotten lands through the support [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=316.24s)]
*  of the United States and through its own military power, which is, they argue, illegitimate. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=321.24s)]
*  And so what's the resolution of this? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=328.84000000000003s)]
*  The resolution is that Israel must not win when it comes to Gaza. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=331.04s)]
*  That Judean Samaria, which is basically the birthplace of Judaism, that Judean Samaria [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=338.84s)]
*  must be, quote unquote, returned. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=345.84s)]
*  To whom? [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=348.84s)]
*  The Palestinians. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=349.84s)]
*  Well, they were never there. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=350.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=351.84s)]
*  We need a two-state solution. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=353.64s)]
*  But what about the ideology of Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood and all the rest of the [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=355.24s)]
*  terrorist organizations? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=359.84s)]
*  They're not interested in states. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=360.84s)]
*  They're interested in caliphates. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=361.84s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=363.44s)]
*  We American Marxists, we're looking at the world. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=364.44s)]
*  We American Marxists, we're looking at this through the lens of how we perceive the world [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=366.84s)]
*  to be and how we perceive the world was and how we perceive the world needs to be. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=371.84s)]
*  And that is what's going on with Blinken and Sullivan and Malley, the same people who worked [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=379.53999999999996s)]
*  for Barack Obama. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=386.44s)]
*  That's why Barack Obama put out that outrageous statement. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=387.44s)]
*  He's pretty much in hiding and quiet. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=390.44s)]
*  He doesn't want to reveal his invisible hand, but he puts out that outrageous statement [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=393.04s)]
*  basically underscoring everything I'm telling you. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=397.04s)]
*  And that's why you scratch your heads on American policy. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=399.64s)]
*  On the one hand, they run over to Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=402.54s)]
*  They embrace the prime minister. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=406.94s)]
*  They tell the Israelis, we stand with you no matter what. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=409.14s)]
*  We have your backs over and over again. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=411.84s)]
*  And that's another strategy called the hold them tight strategy. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=414.14s)]
*  The idea is hold Israel tightly while you pull the shiv out of your pocket and you stab [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=417.94s)]
*  them in the back. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=424.34s)]
*  That is exactly what's taking place right now. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=425.74s)]
*  It may seem shocking to many of you, but it shouldn't be. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=429.14s)]
*  If you follow Thomas Friedman at the New York Times, and I'm sure most of you don't, but [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=431.74s)]
*  I have to. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=435.74s)]
*  And I only do so well after I've had a meal. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=436.74s)]
*  When you look at that, you can see the ideology there. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=440.04s)]
*  You can see the ideology with Blinken in the past when he worked for Obama's Deputy Secretary [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=442.94s)]
*  of State. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=447.84s)]
*  Sullivan, Jake Sullivan, has actually written about this ideological approach. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=448.84s)]
*  And then you say to yourself, but why are they helping the Iranians? [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=452.94s)]
*  The Iranians keep attacking us. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=455.94s)]
*  We see tunnels to towers, wounded soldiers could seal these things. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=458.14s)]
*  It's not just Afghanistan. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=461.53999999999996s)]
*  It's what the Iranians have done to all of our men and women. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=462.53999999999996s)]
*  Why do we treat them like we do? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=466.9s)]
*  Why are we such patsies? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=468.4s)]
*  We have two massive, basically, naval armadas over there that could do severe damage to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=469.55999999999995s)]
*  Well, we can't expand the war. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=475.76s)]
*  Well, we're not expanding anything. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=477.76s)]
*  We're defending ourselves. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=479.96s)]
*  But the language, the propaganda, they're trying to create, as Michael Duran wrote in [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=480.96s)]
*  the tablet, a complete realignment in the Middle East. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=486.66s)]
*  Because Israel's like America. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=490.72s)]
*  They're the oppressor. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=492.6s)]
*  Oppressor, oppressed. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=493.6s)]
*  Nobody used to talk about this until I wrote about it in American Marxism. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=495.52s)]
*  He came up with the concept myself. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=498.44s)]
*  Oppressor and oppressed. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=501.6s)]
*  America is the oppressor. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=504.0s)]
*  Israel's now the oppressor. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=506.28s)]
*  We are militaristic. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=508.72s)]
*  We're interfering in other countries. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=510.8s)]
*  And yet, ironically, it's Biden and Blinken that are interfering like nobody else in the [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=512.6s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=517.3s)]
*  So Iran has to be built up, particularly after the Shah of Iran, with the militaristic United [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=518.3s)]
*  States, the CIA, help bring the Shah of Iran to power. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=522.52s)]
*  And the people rose up and got rid of him. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=527.84s)]
*  People never rose up and got rid of him. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=529.8s)]
*  It was the Islamists, the Islamists, who now the Biden administration is supporting in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=531.84s)]
*  Iran. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=537.28s)]
*  They're funding Iran. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=538.76s)]
*  They've lifted all waivers on Iran. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=540.24s)]
*  They rearmed Iran. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=543.4s)]
*  They made it possible for Iran to destroy and murder their own people, who are rising [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=545.0799999999999s)]
*  up to overthrow that regime because the people hate it. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=549.8199999999999s)]
*  They say the Biden administration, Biden does, I believe in democracy, not autocracy. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=553.0799999999999s)]
*  He's much more comfortable with autocrats than he is with small-d Democrats. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=559.08s)]
*  That's 100 percent certain. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=563.72s)]
*  So our entire policy is built on this ideology, that Israel is the problem, that the United [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=566.24s)]
*  States is the problem, not Hamas, not Islamic Jihad, not the Islamist-Nazi regime in Iran, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=572.44s)]
*  not any of these entities. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=582.32s)]
*  We are the problem, and Israel's the problem. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=583.88s)]
*  And so what we need to do with Israel is rearrange its borders, make it even a smaller country, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=586.5200000000001s)]
*  which becomes absolutely indefensible, absolutely indefensible, give the PLO that was founded [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=593.12s)]
*  by Yasser Arafat a known terrorist. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=599.1600000000001s)]
*  And there's still terrorists killing Israelis and Americans out of the so-called moderate [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=602.9200000000001s)]
*  Palestinian regime. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=607.72s)]
*  In fact, just a few days ago, eight Israelis were shot in Jerusalem, three of whom died, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=610.08s)]
*  but they say it's Hamas-connected. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=618.24s)]
*  Everything Hamas-connected, even though Fatah, the PLO, and Hamas are at political odds, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=619.96s)]
*  they support each other, ultimately against us. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=625.9s)]
*  So for Iran, we're the big Satan, and Israel's the little Satan. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=629.64s)]
*  And for Blinken and Sullivan and Malley and even Biden now, it's the same thing. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=634.56s)]
*  The U.S. is the big Satan, and Israel's the little Satan. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=640.92s)]
*  And so now is the opportunity for the Obama team, Obama-Biden, Biden-Obama, doesn't matter, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=644.88s)]
*  to exploit the situation in which Israel's fighting for its survival. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=650.4s)]
*  And they're using the alliances that has been built with Israel over Democrat and Republican [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  Congresses for almost a century. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=660.16s)]
*  The provision of weapons, the sharing of intelligence, they are now using that to threaten, blackmail, [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=665.4s)]
*  pressure Israel to capitulate, to lose the war against Hamas. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=670.64s)]
*  Because the theory is, you see, the Israelis can't go in there and denazify Gaza the way [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=676.76s)]
*  we had to denazify Germany before Germany was free, with the way we had to change Imperial [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=681.6s)]
*  Japan before Imperial Japan was granted its freedom. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=687.68s)]
*  And so we're, no, no, no, no. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=691.4399999999999s)]
*  For Israel, they need to stop and stop now. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=693.4s)]
*  They don't even want them to continue to fighting. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=696.0s)]
*  And should they continue to fight, even with all the handcuffs that are going to be placed [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=697.9599999999999s)]
*  on them and pressured to be placed on them by Biden, Blinken, Sullivan and the rest of [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=702.3599999999999s)]
*  the reprobates, should Israel happen to win, and they better not go into South Gaza, my [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=706.68s)]
*  God, that's where all the people are. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=711.4799999999999s)]
*  But that's where Hamas has moved to as well. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=712.8399999999999s)]
*  They don't want Israel to win. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=715.8s)]
*  They're using our weapons as blackmail. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=718.56s)]
*  They're talking about carving out almost a third of Israel, maybe a fourth or a third [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=723.0799999999999s)]
*  of Israel, and handing it to the very enemy that's been talking about destroying Israel, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=727.7199999999999s)]
*  while they're still funding Iran to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=732.92s)]
*  And here's my question to you, America. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=736.1999999999999s)]
*  Where are the Republicans in Congress? [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=740.5999999999999s)]
*  Isn't this a five-alarm fire? [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=744.32s)]
*  Doesn't this affect us? [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=747.32s)]
*  You better believe it does. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=749.6800000000001s)]
*  What exactly is our policy to prevent Iran from getting nuclear weapons? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=751.4000000000001s)]
*  We don't have one. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=755.0s)]
*  And they're on the precipice. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=757.12s)]
*  Even the U.N. is ringing the bells. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=758.24s)]
*  And if the U.N. is ringing the bells, you know it's serious, because they love Iran. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=759.6s)]
*  It's a huge problem. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=765.24s)]
*  This is a rogue foreign policy. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=767.34s)]
*  This is a foreign policy that's being conducted in the shadows. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=769.6s)]
*  This is a foreign policy where they're using the propaganda of their favorite media outlets, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=773.28s)]
*  CNN, MSNBC, The New York Times, The Washington Post, most of the networks, their favorite [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=777.6s)]
*  columnists to push their agenda. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=782.54s)]
*  When the American people, we do not have a comprehensive, fulsome explanation of what [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=785.12s)]
*  this foreign policy is and where it's taking us. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=790.56s)]
*  You know why? [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=792.92s)]
*  Because under Obama and under Biden, they believe ambiguity, public contradictions, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=793.92s)]
*  confusions, secret shuttle diplomacy that Lincoln's involved in now nonstop with Arab [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=801.1999999999999s)]
*  countries, through the back door with the terrorists, through Qatar and so forth and [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=807.0s)]
*  so on. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=811.1999999999999s)]
*  The less you know, the better. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=812.1999999999999s)]
*  That's the way they view it, because if they actually figured out what they're doing, you'd [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=814.2199999999999s)]
*  be disgusted. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=817.28s)]
*  I hope you were able to follow this beginning to end, because this explains exactly what's [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=819.88s)]
*  going on and why Israel is now in grave and dire straits because of its alliance with [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=824.4s)]
*  the United States. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=829.92s)]
*  And we are in grave and dire straits because of this administration. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GpUhAy8GLTU&t=831.8199999999999s)]
