# Bill Hemmer presses John Kirby on American citizens stuck in Afghanistan
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 15, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY)
*  Let's bring in Pentagon Press Secretary, John Kirby, who is here with us, and we are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=0.0s)]
*  so glad that you are. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=3.42s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=4.7s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=5.7s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=6.7s)]
*  You've done a huge amount of work this year, so we've got lots to cover. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=7.7s)]
*  On this, did you ever think that it was more than 100 Americans there? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=9.44s)]
*  Why was that so hard to nail down? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=14.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's a great question, Dana. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=16.22s)]
*  It was a bit of a moving target throughout the evacuation, because as you know, we don't [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=18.86s)]
*  require American citizens to register their presence in Afghanistan. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=23.12s)]
*  Most of them are dual nationals, so they were struggling with whether to leave or not. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=28.58s)]
*  Sometimes we'd get an indication that, hey, I want to go, and then they might change their [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=33.34s)]
*  mind and so they'd be taken off the list. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=37.34s)]
*  The number was a bit of a moving target. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=39.86s)]
*  What I think is encouraging, though, is that now almost 1,000, since August 31st, since [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=42.0s)]
*  we left, have been brought out, and we're continuing to look for others that want to [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  go. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  The problem with the number is that you are off by 90 percent. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=53.019999999999996s)]
*  Well again, it's not a science, Bill. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=56.14s)]
*  It's not like they register on some sort of list that we just have that's static and permanent. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=58.3s)]
*  Were you assuming that they crossed the border into Pakistan? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=63.86s)]
*  What was the assumption? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=67.86s)]
*  Well, there were lots of assumptions. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=68.86s)]
*  Maybe they left overland to Pakistan, or maybe they just didn't want to declare that they [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=70.5s)]
*  were ready to go. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=75.14s)]
*  The bottom line is, I think part of the issue is that as we have proven successful at getting [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=76.86s)]
*  more out, more and more are now becoming more comfortable saying, hey, we want to go, too. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=82.74s)]
*  So again, we don't think it's a bad thing that the numbers increased. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=87.41999999999999s)]
*  We think it's a good thing, and we're going to continue at this, even though the military [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=90.75999999999999s)]
*  mission's over. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=94.69999999999999s)]
*  The mission to help Americans leave Afghanistan is not over. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=95.69999999999999s)]
*  So one more on that, then, because we know that a lot of veterans groups are still working [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=97.74s)]
*  on it to try to get people out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=101.36s)]
*  We interviewed a guy last week. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=103.69999999999999s)]
*  His name is Bilal Ahmad. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=104.69999999999999s)]
*  He's an American citizen, born in Afghanistan, served as an interpreter for us for many years, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=106.78s)]
*  lives in Queens, American citizen now. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=111.54s)]
*  His wife and son have gone to Kabul in July or so, June, July. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=114.18s)]
*  He goes to rescue them because they can't get out through the airport. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=119.06s)]
*  He goes in to rescue them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=121.96000000000001s)]
*  Now he's in a UAE refugee camp, wife and son, and they can't get back because the State [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=123.54s)]
*  Department can't get the paperwork organized. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=128.9s)]
*  And Congresswoman Meng, she's really trying. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=131.02s)]
*  And I just wonder what it means for veterans who are calling the suicide hotline distressed [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=133.58s)]
*  about this, that we can't figure out a way to get an American citizen back. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=138.38s)]
*  We understand the frustrations there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=142.38s)]
*  I mean, and every veteran of the war is processing all this in their own way. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=144.22s)]
*  We respect that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=148.06s)]
*  And we know that there's a lot of still anxiety about friends, translators, interpreters, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=149.06s)]
*  people that are there, family members that are there. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=154.54s)]
*  That's why there's a task force. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  It's an interagency task force led by the State Department. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=157.62s)]
*  And so in cases like this, we encourage, you know, get us the information, get it to us [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=159.94s)]
*  here, get it to us at the Pentagon. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=164.36s)]
*  Well, I'll get you some more. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=165.54s)]
*  It's Bilal Ahmad. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=166.54s)]
*  Let's get to Ukraine. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=167.9s)]
*  Earlier today, you were on another network, as we say, and you said you do not believe [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  Vladimir Putin has the intent to go into Ukraine. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=172.3s)]
*  What I said. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=175.58s)]
*  Based on what? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=176.58s)]
*  What I said was that we don't believe he's made a decision yet. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=177.58s)]
*  Big difference there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=180.62s)]
*  We are still watching this very closely, Bill. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=182.1s)]
*  I mean, he still has a massive amount of forces, a raid along the border with Ukraine, both [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=183.9s)]
*  to the northeast and south. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=190.14000000000001s)]
*  And it's not exactly clear what his intentions are, which is why I think it was so important [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=192.5s)]
*  for us to reach out to President Putin through President Biden to make it clear that we're [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=196.54s)]
*  watching this closely, that there will be consequences. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=201.26s)]
*  And it's also important why we're reaching out to our allies and partners at defense, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=203.54s)]
*  at state, to make sure that they're seeing the same things we are. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=207.38s)]
*  Do you think it would send a stronger signal to Putin if you offered more weapons to Ukraine [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=210.5s)]
*  or offered more support? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=217.14s)]
*  Secretary Austin was there in October. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=218.82s)]
*  That did not happen. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=220.06s)]
*  Well, we just completed a 60 million dollar package of security assistance to Ukraine [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=221.3s)]
*  week before last. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=226.5s)]
*  The last shipment was small arms and ammunition. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=227.66s)]
*  But that that shipment included two island class patrol boats and javelin anti-tank missiles. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=229.9s)]
*  And we haven't taken off the table additional security assistance. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=236.22s)]
*  You've heard Jake Sullivan talk about that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=239.26s)]
*  That's still something that's being considered. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=241.66s)]
*  Russia and China are talking. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=244.26s)]
*  Wall Street Journal headline Russia and China's dangerous decline. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=246.26s)]
*  And they say that whether war breaks out will depend on how badly Beijing and Moscow [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=249.62s)]
*  fear the global power shift or the next decade and how eager they will be to exploit their [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=252.9s)]
*  perceived current relative advantages to remake the world. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=256.54s)]
*  When I see all of that China and Russia getting together, I know this has been increasingly [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=260.3s)]
*  the way that they like to try to do business and try to push back against the United States. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=264.86s)]
*  How much does that occupy your time thinking about China, not just the Taiwan piece, but [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=269.46s)]
*  the fact that they have this huge technological advantage on hypersonic missiles, for example? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=273.5s)]
*  The secretary has called China the number one pacing challenge for the department. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=278.62s)]
*  And we have spent a lot of this year focused on the China challenge. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=283.9s)]
*  You saw him out at Reagan giving a speech about that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=287.46s)]
*  And they are developing capabilities and pursuing concepts and behavior in the Indo-Pacific [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=290.26s)]
*  particular that it runs inimical to our national security interests and those of our allies [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=295.41999999999996s)]
*  and partners, which is why we're putting so much energy into this. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=299.53999999999996s)]
*  But the other thing you heard the secretary say, Dana, is that we have advantages too. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=302.7s)]
*  We have to approach the China challenge from a position of confidence, not fear, not trepidation. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  They are not 10 feet tall. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=311.26s)]
*  And so China and Russia want to talk. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=312.74s)]
*  That's fine. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=314.54s)]
*  They can speak to that. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=315.54s)]
*  These are two countries that don't have a lot of friends, except maybe each other. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=316.54s)]
*  And even that friendship, I'm sure, is not seated in a lot of trust and confidence. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=320.16s)]
*  At that Reagan event, Secretary Austin, he said, we're not seeking an Asian version of NATO. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=324.82s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=329.94s)]
*  But Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, has been touring Southeast Asia all week. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=330.94s)]
*  In fact, I think because of COVID scare, they're calling a trip to Thailand short. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=333.46s)]
*  However, it would appear that he is trying to assemble some sort of coalition that may [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=337.46s)]
*  perhaps resemble NATO. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=342.82s)]
*  So is Austin telling us what's going on or is Blinken's actions for telling us what's [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=345.21999999999997s)]
*  happening? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=353.09999999999997s)]
*  I think the secretary of state and secretary of defense are in exactly the same place here, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=354.09999999999997s)]
*  Bill. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=357.41999999999996s)]
*  This isn't about forming some formal alliance or, as you put it, coalition. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=358.41999999999996s)]
*  It is, however, about reinforcing the alliances that we already have in the region. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=362.08s)]
*  Five of our seven treaty alliances are in the Pacific. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=367.12s)]
*  A lot of people don't know that. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=369.52s)]
*  And also reinforcing partnerships and friendships that we have absent formal associations that [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=371.44s)]
*  are still important to us. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=376.56s)]
*  So Indonesia, Thailand, there's all kinds of countries in the region that we don't have [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=377.56s)]
*  some formal treaty alliance with that are concerned about where China is going and want [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=382.96s)]
*  to see the United States care about it, too. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=388.28s)]
*  We want to see our leadership out there. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=390.0s)]
*  We're not asking these countries to choose between the United States and China, but we [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=391.58s)]
*  are asking them to... [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=395.76s)]
*  Would the United States be better off if we did? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=396.85999999999996s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=399.94s)]
*  I think, look, you have to understand a lot of these countries have economic ties to China [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=401.41999999999996s)]
*  that they're concerned about, and we respect that. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=406.21999999999997s)]
*  What we want, though, is for the community of nations in the Pacific to realize what [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=409.15999999999997s)]
*  China is doing with this coercive, aggressive behavior and to be willing to push back on [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=414.08s)]
*  that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=418.26s)]
*  Hey, just one last question. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=419.26s)]
*  A majority of military service members vaccinated 96.4 percent, at least one dose, 90 percent [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=420.26s)]
*  fully vaccinated, though some have been let go. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=425.46s)]
*  But defense contractors, there's a pause, I understand, on that. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=429.5s)]
*  There's a court order that... [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=432.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=433.7s)]
*  Where do you see this going? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=434.7s)]
*  Well, with the force, I think the numbers are really trending in the right direction. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=435.7s)]
*  And I think you can see the vast majority of our men and women in uniform are doing [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=439.86s)]
*  the right thing and they're getting that vaccine to protect themselves and their units. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=443.34s)]
*  There will be small numbers that, without getting an exemption, will refuse to do it, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=447.9s)]
*  and they'll have to be dealt with in the appropriate service-specific administrative way. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=450.62s)]
*  But I think the numbers are going to be really small, Dana. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=455.38s)]
*  I mean, you can see that ever since we made the vaccine mandatory, the numbers of fully [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=457.09999999999997s)]
*  vaccinated have just continued to increase. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=461.9s)]
*  And that's good for force readiness. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=464.06s)]
*  I was surprised that there were 17 vaccines that are required for service members anyway. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=465.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, when you come in the military and you sign up and take that oath, you sign up to [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=469.38s)]
*  take vaccines. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=473.09999999999997s)]
*  Keep yourself safe. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=474.09999999999997s)]
*  Sorry about the interruption here. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=475.09999999999997s)]
*  Amtrak reversed itself, literally on the tracks of the vaccine mandate. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=476.58000000000004s)]
*  Do you see the Pentagon doing the same? [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=480.78000000000003s)]
*  No, I do not. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=482.70000000000005s)]
*  In terms of the mandatory vaccine? [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=484.3s)]
*  No, I don't think so. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=485.98s)]
*  Not with numbers like that. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=486.98s)]
*  It is a valid military medical requirement. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=487.98s)]
*  And the science has proven that it makes you more safe against this virus. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=490.86s)]
*  And if you want a strong national defense, you want your troops to be protected. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=494.86s)]
*  That goes everywhere from body armor to a vaccine that you get in your arm. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=499.22s)]
*  And you have family that's still serving as well. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=502.94s)]
*  I do. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=505.54s)]
*  My son's an active duty sailor in the Navy, an officer, and my son-in-law is one as well. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=506.54s)]
*  Who knows about the grandchildren? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=510.66s)]
*  We don't know how often you're in New York, but you're welcome to come back any time. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=512.14s)]
*  Yes, love to have you. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=515.1s)]
*  Thank you so much, guys. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=516.1s)]
*  We have a thousand questions every commercial break. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=517.1s)]
*  I'm ready for them. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=519.14s)]
*  I like how he's trying to show daylight between State and Department and DOD. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=520.14s)]
*  He's been around that track before. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=523.5s)]
*  Thank you so much, guys. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=525.46s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Sd9TtIEIY&t=526.46s)]
