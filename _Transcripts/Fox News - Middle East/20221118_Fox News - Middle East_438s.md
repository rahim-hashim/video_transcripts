# AG Garland announces special counsel to investigate Trump
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 18, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk)
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm here today to announce the appointment of a special counsel in connection with two [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=5.92s)]
*  ongoing criminal investigations that have received significant public attention. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=10.52s)]
*  The first, as described in court filings in the District of Columbia, is the investigation [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  into whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer of power following [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  the 2020 presidential election or the certification of the electoral college vote held on or about [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=28.56s)]
*  January 6, 2021. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=35.2s)]
*  The second is the ongoing investigation involving classified documents and other presidential [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=37.96s)]
*  records, as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation, referenced and described [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=43.56s)]
*  in court filings in a pending matter in the Southern District of Florida. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=49.4s)]
*  I'm joined today by Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco, U.S. Attorney for the District [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=54.48s)]
*  of Columbia Matthew Graves, and Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=59.919999999999995s)]
*  Kenneth Polite. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=64.12s)]
*  Assistant Attorney General for National Security Matthew Olson could not be here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=66.08s)]
*  He is currently in Germany representing the Department at the G7 Home Affairs and Security [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=70.6s)]
*  Ministerial. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=76.28s)]
*  U.S. Attorney Graves has been ably leading the investigations into the events leading [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=78.47999999999999s)]
*  up to and on January 6. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=82.52000000000001s)]
*  He and dozens of Assistant U.S. Attorneys and other prosecutors have taken on the monumental [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=85.56s)]
*  task of conducting over 900 prosecutions in defense of our democratic institutions. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=91.68s)]
*  Criminal Division prosecutors under the able leadership of Assistant Attorney General Polite [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=100.32000000000001s)]
*  have played a significant role in those prosecutions. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=104.72s)]
*  Assistant Attorney General Olson has been ably leading the team responsible for investigating [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=108.76s)]
*  the matter involving classified documents and other presidential records, as well as [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=112.56s)]
*  the possible obstruction of that investigation. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=118.04s)]
*  All of the career prosecutors assigned to these matters are conducting their work in [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=121.64s)]
*  the best traditions of the Department of Justice. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=125.64s)]
*  I also want to recognize the efforts of the many FBI agents and other law enforcement [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=129.52s)]
*  personnel who are assigned to these matters. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=133.88s)]
*  They are working courageously and steadfastly and are serving our nation honorably. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=136.96s)]
*  I am grateful to them. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=143.16s)]
*  We all are. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=145.10000000000002s)]
*  The Department of Justice has long recognized that in certain extraordinary cases, it is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=147.16s)]
*  in the public interest to appoint a special prosecutor to independently manage an investigation [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=152.56s)]
*  and prosecution. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=158.08s)]
*  Based on recent developments, including the former president's announcement that he is [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=160.16s)]
*  a candidate for president in the next election, and the sitting president's stated intention [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=164.76s)]
*  to be a candidate as well, I have concluded that it is in the public interest to appoint [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=170.2s)]
*  a special counsel. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=176.04s)]
*  Such an appointment underscores the Department's commitment to both independence and accountability [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=178.16s)]
*  in particularly sensitive matters. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  It also allows prosecutors and agents to continue their work expeditiously and to make decisions [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=188.1s)]
*  indisputably guided only by the facts and the law. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  The special counsel will conduct parts of the first investigation I just mentioned. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=199.32s)]
*  The investigation into whether any person or entity unlawfully interfered with the transfer [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=204.64s)]
*  of power following the 2020 presidential election or with the certification of the Electoral [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=209.57999999999998s)]
*  College vote held on or about January 6. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=215.6s)]
*  This does not include prosecutions that are currently pending in the District of Columbia [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=219.76s)]
*  or future investigations and prosecutions of individuals for offenses committed while [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=224.2s)]
*  they were physically present on the Capitol grounds on January 6. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  Those investigations and prosecutions will remain under the authority of the U.S. Attorney [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  for the District of Columbia. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=238.68s)]
*  The special counsel will also conduct the investigation involving classified documents [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=241.42s)]
*  and other presidential records, as well as the possible obstruction of that investigation. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=245.6s)]
*  Today, I signed an order appointing Jack Smith to serve as special counsel. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=252.6s)]
*  The order authorizes him to continue the ongoing investigation into both of the matters that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=259.8s)]
*  I have just described and to prosecute any federal crimes that may arise from those investigations. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=264.8s)]
*  Mr. Smith is a veteran career prosecutor. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=271.4s)]

*  Integrity Section, where he led a team of more than 30 prosecutors who handled public [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  corruption and election crimes cases across the United States. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=316.17999999999995s)]
*  In 2015, he agreed to serve as the first assistant U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Tennessee, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=320.58s)]
*  later becoming the acting United States Attorney. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=327.58s)]
*  Most recently, Mr. Smith served as a chief prosecutor for the Special Court in The Hague, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=331.02s)]
*  charged with investigating and adjudicating war crimes in Kosovo. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=336.46s)]
*  Mr. Smith will begin his work as special counsel immediately and will be returning to the United [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=340.65999999999997s)]
*  States from The Hague. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=345.65999999999997s)]
*  Throughout his career, Jack Smith has built a reputation as an impartial and determined [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=348.94s)]
*  prosecutor, who leads teams with energy and focus to follow the facts wherever they lead. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=353.79999999999995s)]
*  As special counsel, he will exercise independent prosecutorial judgment to decide whether charges [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=361.02000000000004s)]
*  should be brought. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=366.90000000000003s)]
*  Although the special counsel will not be subject to the day-to-day supervision of any official [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=368.86s)]
*  of the department, he must comply with the regulations, procedures, and policies of the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=372.86s)]
*  department. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=378.02000000000004s)]
*  I will ensure that the special counsel receives the resources to conduct this work quickly [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=379.5s)]
*  and completely. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=384.94s)]
*  Given the work to date and Mr. Smith's prosecutorial experience, I am confident that this appointment [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=386.82s)]
*  will not slow the completion of these investigations. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=392.09999999999997s)]
*  The men and women who are pursuing these investigations are conducting themselves in accordance with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=396.53999999999996s)]
*  the highest standards of professionalism. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=403.53999999999996s)]
*  I could not be prouder of them. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=406.29999999999995s)]
*  I strongly believe that the normal processes of this department can handle all investigations [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=408.82s)]
*  with integrity. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=414.21999999999997s)]
*  And I also believe that appointing a special counsel at this time is the right thing to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=416.1s)]
*  do. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=421.14000000000004s)]
*  The extraordinary circumstances presented here demand it. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=422.14000000000004s)]
*  Mr. Smith is the right choice to complete these matters in an even-handed and urgent [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=426.74s)]
*  manner. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=432.66s)]
*  Thank you all. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2I1Eeebwovk&t=433.66s)]
