# Hannity: This became inevitable after there was no response from President Biden
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI)
*  Welcome to Hannity Busy Monday night, the border showdown in Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=0.0s)]
*  That is heating up. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=8.98s)]
*  It is now a constitutional crisis and a national security crisis. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=9.98s)]
*  And Governor Greg Abbott, he's not backing down. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=14.84s)]
*  He will join us with the very latest. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Plus, the possible Senate border deal would be a disaster for the country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=19.14s)]
*  We're going to tell you why every Republican senator should be strongly opposed to it. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=24.02s)]
*  But first, American soldiers abroad are under attack. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=29.080000000000002s)]
*  Three brave members of the U.S. Army, they were killed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=32.28s)]
*  And we had, what, over 40 more injured in a drone attack on a base in Jordan yesterday. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=36.32s)]
*  One official is now saying that the drone evaded U.S. defenses because it was mistaken [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=42.160000000000004s)]
*  for an American drone? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=46.96s)]
*  Well, that begs the question, what's going on with our military? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=48.400000000000006s)]
*  We know our defense secretary spent days in the ICU. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=52.040000000000006s)]
*  The commander-in-chief had no knowledge of it at all. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=55.72s)]
*  Now there are three soldiers dead because of a drone proxy from an Iranian proxy, was [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=58.6s)]
*  mistaken for a U.S. one. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=64.84s)]
*  Now since October the 17th, there have been at least 165 attacks carried out on our U.S. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=67.08s)]
*  forces. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=73.72s)]
*  You see the locations on your screen. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=74.72s)]
*  How many more times do American troops need to be targeted and attacked before we have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  a president that will take action and defend them? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=81.36s)]
*  After all the previous attacks and no response from President Joe, this now became inevitable. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=84.66000000000001s)]
*  Just like no consequences ever for Russia or China or Iran. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=90.78s)]
*  All these groups causing chaos and destruction in the Middle East. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=95.42s)]
*  You have Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=99.06s)]
*  They're all funded and backed by Iran, the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=102.9s)]
*  Former President Trump called out Biden for his weakness on truth social, saying, quote, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=107.18s)]
*  This brazen attack on the United States is yet another horrific and tragic consequence [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=112.3s)]
*  of Joe Biden's weakness and surrender. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=117.88s)]
*  And speaking in South Carolina yesterday, Biden had an opportunity to send a strong [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=120.7s)]
*  message to his friends, his pals, the mullahs in Iran in the wake of these deadly attacks. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=125.17999999999999s)]
*  But instead, he offered nothing but this tepid response. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=131.62s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=135.22s)]
*  One last thing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=136.78s)]
*  I want to point out that we had a tough day last night in the Middle East. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=138.78s)]
*  We lost three brave soldiers attacking our base. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=146.06s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=151.18s)]
*  I'd ask you to come to the side with your all three little small soldiers. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=152.46s)]
*  Jesus. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=156.54s)]
*  And we shall respond. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=157.58s)]
*  And we shall respond. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=168.14000000000001s)]
*  This is pretty much par for the course with this administration, who, instead of using [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=173.3s)]
*  forceful deterrence, just had a simple message for Iran all along. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=177.48000000000002s)]
*  Their message, whenever asked, well, what about Iran? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=185.70000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=187.01999999999998s)]
*  What is your message to Hezbollah and its backer, Iran? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=188.01999999999998s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=193.1s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=194.1s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=195.1s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=196.1s)]
*  And what's the message to Iran? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=197.1s)]
*  Don't. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=199.1s)]
*  As President Biden said, just don't. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=200.1s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=203.1s)]
*  One word. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=204.1s)]
*  Pretty straightforward. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=205.1s)]
*  It was very important to send a very clear message to anyone who might seek to take advantage [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=206.78s)]
*  of the conflict in Gaza to threaten our personnel here or anywhere else in the region. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=213.34s)]
*  Don't do it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=218.94s)]
*  I've already delivered the message to Iran. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=219.94s)]
*  They know not to do anything. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=220.94s)]
*  Oh, now they know not to do anything. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=227.94s)]
*  Don't becomes do and nothing happens. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=230.1s)]
*  Big shock. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=232.1s)]
*  The strategy didn't work. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=233.1s)]
*  Why would Iran, the world's largest state-sponsored terrorism, stop? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=234.26s)]
*  There are no consequences for all their actions. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=238.62s)]
*  Joe Biden's weakness is the reason that the country of Iran and China and the country [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=241.1s)]
*  of Russia are so emboldened. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=247.42000000000002s)]
*  It is the reason we woke up yesterday to three dead soldiers and dozens others injured. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=249.42000000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden is the appeaser in chief. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=255.38s)]
*  Once again, Joe Biden, if he didn't respond the other, what, 175 times, what would the [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=257.98s)]
*  Iranians expect? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=265.22s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=266.94s)]
*  That's why he has blood on his hands. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=267.94s)]
*  He has caused this. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=269.54s)]
*  This administration has reportedly turned a blind eye to Iran getting rich with their [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=271.04s)]
*  surging oil sales, even as they remain under Western sanctions. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=275.88s)]
*  That's basically Joe allowing them, you know, to bring billions of dollars into their coffers [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=280.04s)]
*  again to sponsor more terror. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=285.20000000000005s)]
*  Biden gave Iran, what, $6 billion as ransom payment and a prisoner swap. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=287.40000000000003s)]
*  Then the Biden administration renewed a sanctions waiver, giving Iran access to another $10 [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=292.88s)]
*  in this case from Iraq in exchange for electricity sales. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=299.32s)]
*  Biden is only enabling and appeasing Iran and their ability to fund terror groups. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=303.28s)]
*  And the world better pay attention because that same country, Iran, is desperately trying [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  to acquire nuclear weapons. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=314.71999999999997s)]
*  And by the way, they have now aligned themselves with both Russia and China. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=316.84s)]
*  Would you be shocked if Russia and China would help them with their nuclear program? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=321.4s)]
*  Because I would not. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=325.56s)]
*  They are now enriching uranium almost to the point of being weapons grade. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=326.68s)]
*  That's at least according to the latest assessment. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=331.68s)]
*  I don't know if anybody really knows, but that is what appeasement does. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=333.36s)]
*  As Senator Tom Cotton said in a statement yesterday, Joe Biden emboldened Iran for years [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  by tolerating attacks on our troops, bribing the ayatollahs with billions of dollars and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  appeasing them to no end. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=347.72s)]
*  He left our troops as sitting ducks and now three Americans are dead and dozens now others [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=349.76s)]
*  are wounded. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=355.96s)]
*  And sadly, I've been predicting this would happen for months. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=357.2s)]
*  So that's what Tom Cotton said. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=360.56s)]
*  So will we. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=361.88s)]
*  And then to make matters worse, according to NBC News, the administration is discussing [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=363.03999999999996s)]
*  the idea of slowing some weaponry to Israel to what? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=367.44s)]
*  To pressure them into scaling back their military operations in Gaza after the worst terrorist [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=370.88s)]
*  attack in their history. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=376.4s)]
*  Instead of saying, we support your war against terror. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=378.24s)]
*  That's all you have to do, Joe. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=380.92s)]
*  What is happening in the Middle East is devastating. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=382.68s)]
*  And sadly, all of it preventable were it not for Joe's failed and very weak leadership. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mv75dVkVyvI&t=385.38s)]
