# Hezbollah is in a ‘state of disarray’: Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak)
*  ERIK AND MIKE, THANK YOU. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=0.0s)]
*  WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN LUTENANT GENERAL KEITH KELLOG RIGHT NOW, A FORMER NATIONAL SECURITY [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=1.0s)]
*  ADVISOR TO VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=5.16s)]
*  HE'S ALSO A FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=7.2s)]
*  SO GENERAL KELLOG, YOU JUST HEARD MIKE TOBIN REPORT OF HEZBLAH FIRING SHOTS TOWARDS ISRAEL, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=9.56s)]
*  JURUSLIM AND A SPECIFIC AREA THERE. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=17.2s)]
*  I WANT TO GET YOUR TAKE ON THAT. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=19.48s)]
*  AND ALSO, HOURS AGO, THE STATE DEPARTMENT CALLED FOR ALL NON-ESSENTIAL PERSONNEL AND [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=21.6s)]
*  THEIR FAMILIES TO LEAVE LEBANON. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=26.48s)]
*  SO DOES THIS IMPLY IMITATED ESCALATION, OR IS THAT LAST PART SIMPLY PROTOCOL? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=28.72s)]
*  Yeah, Arthel, thanks for having me. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=35.32s)]
*  Look, I think what the Israelis have done is kind of reestablish a level of deterrence [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  that we have not seen in the Middle East for a long, long time. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=41.92s)]
*  They were striking against Nisrallah, killing Nisrallah. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=45.08s)]
*  Look what they've done before with Hamas when they killed Hani in Tehran. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  That was the leader. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=52.0s)]
*  Then Yair Yassin, who's the current leader, is now wounded. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=53.64s)]
*  They really can't find him. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=56.76s)]
*  They took out the number two guy in Hezbollah, Shukr. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=58.44s)]
*  They've taken 16 of the 18 commanders out. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=61.72s)]
*  You know, it's kind of, there's some Israeli poetry here. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=64.24s)]
*  When they took out Nisrallah, they took him out in an area called Dehiyah. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=67.8s)]
*  You know, Dehiyah is what the Israelis call supra-escalation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=72.4s)]
*  In other words, escalation that goes well beyond what you would expect as a norm. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=75.24s)]
*  And nobody should have been surprised by this. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=79.32s)]
*  And what they have done by taking out the leaders of both Hamas and Hezbollah, they've [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=81.36s)]
*  sent a real clear signal to Iran, who's really the backer of all this. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=84.88s)]
*  And they've told the supreme leader and they've told everybody in Iran, look, you better be [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=89.36s)]
*  on guard because that means we can get to you as well. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  And I think they now know that. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=97.02s)]
*  So there's a level of deterrence that's been set. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=98.56s)]
*  When you talk about evacuation, sure, probably, but I don't think it's going to be needed. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=100.82s)]
*  I think Hezbollah now is currently at a state of disarray. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=105.0s)]
*  I think the Israelis are on the front foot. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=108.0s)]
*  I wouldn't be surprised if they push a little bit harder now and move Hezbollah forces north [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=110.24s)]
*  of the Latani River, which allows 60 to 100,000 Israelis that have been displaced near that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=114.42s)]
*  border to move back to their homeland. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  And they're actually their homes just south of Lebanon. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  So I think they've done a remarkable job. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=125.52000000000001s)]
*  Look, what the Israelis have done has been absolutely remarkable. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=127.62s)]
*  How they've broken the intelligence system, how they've gotten into the comms systems, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=131.46s)]
*  killing the major leaders. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=135.46s)]
*  They've really kind of established a level that we haven't seen. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=136.9s)]
*  And by the way, the United States wasn't involved in this. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=139.18s)]
*  Not at all. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=141.7s)]
*  They didn't tell us about the strikes. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=142.7s)]
*  They didn't tell the Defense Department about the strikes. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=144.06s)]
*  This is Israeli fighting multiple enemies on multiple fronts and doing a pretty good [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=145.94s)]
*  job with it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=149.98s)]
*  OK. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=150.98s)]
*  So you pointed out how Israel has assassinated Hezbollah's leader. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=151.98s)]
*  He was the leader for decades. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  Hassan Nasrali, he took over in 1992, plus a panel of other leaderships. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=159.26s)]
*  So this can go in multiple directions. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=165.42s)]
*  So tell us what could happen next and what is likely to happen next. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=168.56s)]
*  Yeah, great question, Arthel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=173.56s)]
*  Look, this is a great opportunity for the United States to get involved in the Middle [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  East and head towards some type of peace. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=179.16s)]
*  The options are now on the table. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=181.67999999999998s)]
*  They can say, they can look at the Iranians and say, look, you've lost Hezbollah as a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=183.67999999999998s)]
*  military fighting force. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=187.56s)]
*  You've lost Moss as a military fighting force. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=189.04s)]
*  The Israelis are clearly in charge. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=191.72s)]
*  Maybe this is the time where we need to back up a step and sit down and talk on how do [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=193.6s)]
*  we get to Mideast peace. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=196.95999999999998s)]
*  So there's an opportunity here in the United States to jump in on it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, the United States hasn't done that. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=202.04s)]
*  But this is going to be a very slim opportunity because the longer this goes, the wider the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=203.79999999999998s)]
*  war may be expected and the Iranians are going to get involved. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=207.72s)]
*  The Iranians aren't going to use any land forces because they've got that huge gap on [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=210.76s)]
*  land bridge. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=214.11999999999998s)]
*  They can't get there, but they can do some major strikes. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=215.12s)]
*  But if they do that, what the Israelis have told them, Arthel, very clearly, if you strike [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=217.04s)]
*  us, we are going to strike the crown jewel of Iran right now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=222.12s)]
*  And that's their nuclear capability, which they're trying to grow. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=225.72s)]
*  So what I would like to see is the United States get involved much more aggressively. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't think they will. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=233.20000000000002s)]
*  But it's an opportunity, but I believe it'll be an opportunity to the lost. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=234.72s)]
*  Well, how does the United States get more involved? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=237.84s)]
*  I mean, they've been trying for months, a year now, to get a diplomatic into what's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  happening in Gaza. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=248.0s)]
*  OK, and now this is happening. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=249.0s)]
*  And then there are reports that our president hasn't spoken to the prime minister of Israel [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=251.04s)]
*  in a while. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=257.56s)]
*  That relationship seems to have broken down. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=258.68s)]
*  So what really is the diplomatic option here? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=261.48s)]
*  And it seems that also that Netanyahu, I mean, he pretty much dressed down the UN and he [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=265.6s)]
*  seems to be doing what he wants to do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=271.12s)]
*  So how does this work? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=273.48s)]
*  How do you bring all the parties to the table to come to a diplomatic solution? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=275.4s)]
*  Well, one, I don't blame Netanyahu when he talked to the UN. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=280.52s)]
*  The UN passed UN Security Council Resolution 1701 over 20 years ago, and that was supposed [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=282.72s)]
*  to solve the Lebanese problem. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=288.68s)]
*  So he is discarding the UN, and I don't really blame him for that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=290.24s)]
*  The real key to this whole problem right now, I believe, is Saudi Arabia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=293.04s)]
*  And that is the reason I've got a concern is because the relationship that President [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  Biden, Vice President Harris has with Saudi Arabia is not really good. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=301.16s)]
*  And he's got to go to the Emiratis as well and somehow bring them together very candidly [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=304.8s)]
*  Arthel, I don't see anything happening until the election because I don't think anybody's [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=309.56s)]
*  going to respond to that. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=313.71999999999997s)]
*  So I think, as I said, this was an opportunity, but I believe it's going to be an opportunity [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=315.08s)]
*  lost. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=319.08s)]
*  But the real key to this now is going to be the Saudis. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=320.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=322.56s)]
*  Because they hold the money. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=323.56s)]
*  And if we can get them to get involved in some type of peace process and calm the entire [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  region down, I think it'll work. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=328.88s)]
*  But it's going to take a new administration to do it. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=331.03999999999996s)]
*  It's hard to say that, but I think everybody realistically sees that as well. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=333.64s)]
*  So that brings me to this Mike Chobin's reporting of the long range missiles fired by Hezbollah [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  into Jerusalem. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=346.40000000000003s)]
*  It's my understanding of early reporting. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=348.40000000000003s)]
*  It's all fog of war situation here that the areas that was they aimed or the target, I [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=351.24s)]
*  should say, in Jerusalem is a heavy Arab area. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  So is there a direct correlation there? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=365.44s)]
*  You're saying that if the Saudis, if they're the key to some sort of peace through diplomacy, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=368.24s)]
*  is this does Iran know that they're aware of that? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=374.52s)]
*  So maybe they're like, no, we're going to target them, too. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=377.88s)]
*  Well, I think what you're seeing, Arthel, is really there's it's actually leader Hezbollah's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=382.04s)]
*  really leadership right now because they took out the number one guy in Nasrallah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=385.16s)]
*  They took out Shouk earlier. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  They took 16 of the 18 commanders out there. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=391.0s)]
*  They've taken Quds for Iranian Quds Force commanders out as well in the recent strike [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=393.6s)]
*  in the Dihya district. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=397.28000000000003s)]
*  So you look at it and you go, OK, it's kind of random shooting. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=399.0s)]
*  This is where you need the United States should reach out to Iran as well. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=401.16s)]
*  Now, you have to go through a protective power because we don't have any relations with Iran, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=405.0s)]
*  but basically tell them they better back off because Iran, Israel is clearly on the front [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=408.68s)]
*  foot. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=413.32s)]
*  They're going to keep pushing and they'll push against Iran next. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=414.32s)]
*  You know, when you look at it, if you're keeping a scorecard right now, they're two and oh, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=416.78000000000003s)]
*  and they can go three and oh real fast. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=420.32s)]
*  Well, I mean, listen, so many you've got Hezbollah without, you know, without their leadership. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=423.32s)]
*  So so wondering if they're going to become this rogue, out of control bunch of terrorists [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=429.84s)]
*  running around or if Iran can actually maintain control over them. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=434.92s)]
*  Well, that's that's a great question, because I also killed in the strike in Nasrallah with [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=440.48s)]
*  the Quds Force, Iranian Quds Force leaders that were actually working inside Lebanon [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=445.12s)]
*  with Hezbollah. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=450.68s)]
*  So this is one they're going to have to kind of reconstitute their force. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=452.56s)]
*  You're going to have to go to General Ghani, who now leads the Quds Force inside Iran. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=455.2s)]
*  They're going to have to get to him and say, OK, everybody probably should calm down a [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=459.32s)]
*  bit because I think you've now got some random violence going on with you. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=461.72s)]
*  That's the reason why I think the Iranians need to step in because the Israelis hold [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=465.56s)]
*  him accountable and they've got to do that. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=469.32s)]
*  And I think they're making a mistake if they don't. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=471.92s)]
*  And again, this is an opportunity. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=473.8s)]
*  But I'm really afraid, Arthel, it's going to be a missed opportunity going forward. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=475.52s)]
*  I hope not. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=481.0s)]
*  I hope you're wrong, Lieutenant General Keith Kalaagami. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=482.0s)]
*  I mean, we want this to want to contain this for sure. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elzm9-DMeak&t=486.0s)]
