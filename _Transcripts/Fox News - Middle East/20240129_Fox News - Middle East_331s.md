# 'We shall respond': Biden warns of retaliation after 3 US troops killed
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8)
*  We got a Fox News alert now and it's not good news. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=0.0s)]
*  Three U.S. service members are dead and at least 34 soldiers are seriously hurt in a [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=2.82s)]
*  drone attack carried out by Iranian-based militants over in Jordan, we think. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  Now Defense Secretary Austin is expected to return to the Pentagon for the first time [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=11.76s)]
*  today since his mysterious hospitalization. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=15.52s)]
*  So let's take a look at what's happening right now before we bring in our guest. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=18.6s)]
*  This is where the actual attack took place and we got troops here and we have a huge [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=21.62s)]
*  sprawling embassy here. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=27.900000000000002s)]
*  There are talks right now for our people to leave this region and if you want to see how [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=29.5s)]
*  often these attacks happen, check this out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=34.78s)]
*  Look at these number of attacks that have happened since October 7th and you could even [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=38.02s)]
*  have the same amount of attacks really since October 20th, let alone the ones in the Red [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=41.78s)]
*  Sea and we have done nothing, almost nothing, just a handful of attacks back, which makes [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=45.42s)]
*  us wonder what is our approach here. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=50.019999999999996s)]
*  Here now to discuss is Brigadier General Rob Spalding. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=52.6s)]
*  General, great to see you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=55.34s)]
*  Your reaction to the attack over the weekend? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=56.74s)]
*  Well, first of all, the president talked about terrorism. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=63.7s)]
*  It's not terrorism, it's a state-sponsored attack and then he said we're going to go [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=65.62s)]
*  after those responsible and unfortunately I've been expecting this for a while because [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=69.1s)]
*  we're not going after Iran, who's the one responsible. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=73.38s)]
*  Here's what the president said over the weekend. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=79.22s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=81.1s)]
*  One last thing I want to point out that we had a tough day last night in the Middle East. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=83.1s)]
*  We lost three brave souls attacking one of our bases. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=92.1s)]
*  Yes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=98.1s)]
*  And the last people who were inside were all three of us, all of us. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=99.1s)]
*  And we shall respond. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=103.1s)]
*  We shall respond. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=106.1s)]
*  But we know this. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=107.1s)]
*  We know the militias did it, but we know these guys are behind it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=109.1s)]
*  How long do we hit them directly and send a message? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=113.1s)]
*  Will that be the most effective message possible in your view? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=117.1s)]
*  Well, look, war is politics by other means and in this case you're going after the Iranian [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=124.1s)]
*  regime. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=129.1s)]
*  So what are the things that they care about? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=130.1s)]
*  Well, first of all, economically they care about oil. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=132.1s)]
*  They sell weapons to Russia. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=134.1s)]
*  The Iranian leaders themselves have personal assets that you can put at risk. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=137.1s)]
*  We did this during the Kosovo war. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=141.1s)]
*  We went after the Serbian leaders, the people that were supporting on Milosevic. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=143.1s)]
*  We went after their assets. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=149.1s)]
*  We took them away. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=150.1s)]
*  Within two weeks, you know, they capitulated. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=151.1s)]
*  This is something that you got to get Iran to stop attacking and you have to go after [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=153.1s)]
*  those things that the Iranian leaders desire, cherish, or, you know, are part of their personal [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=157.1s)]
*  assets. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=162.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=163.1s)]
*  If that's indeed possible. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=164.1s)]
*  The other thing that is pretty clear is Iran is coming apart on the inside. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=165.1s)]
*  There's countless arrests. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=169.1s)]
*  There's people extremely unhappy with that horrible regime. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=171.1s)]
*  They deserve better and there's some unrest there. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=173.1s)]
*  Do you think they can afford to lose some of their oil wells? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=176.1s)]
*  There are some sites that we could hit that would send a message. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=179.1s)]
*  Do you think we should consider doing that? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=182.1s)]
*  I think we should do that. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=187.1s)]
*  We should also look at targeting Chinese banks who are basically supporting their Iranian [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=188.1s)]
*  regime. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=193.1s)]
*  You have to basically draw a noose. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=194.1s)]
*  And we're not talking about a literal noose. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=196.1s)]
*  In some cases, that might be needed. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=198.1s)]
*  But right now, let's draw a financial and economic noose around the regime, specifically [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=200.1s)]
*  those, you know, in the regime that have personal assets that you can take away, whether by [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=205.1s)]
*  seizing them or destroying them. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=210.1s)]
*  Hey, General, do you think that if China was hit consistently 159 times in the Middle [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=213.1s)]
*  East that they would have a measured response? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=218.1s)]
*  No, I think quite frankly, I just don't understand our policy right now with regard to this going [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=224.1s)]
*  on in the Middle East. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=232.1s)]
*  If we're not going to protect our troops by going after those responsible, the Iranian [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=233.1s)]
*  leaders, then I think we should take them out of the region. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=238.1s)]
*  At the same time, the President of the United States' idea when he took office was, let's [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=241.1s)]
*  try to get a nuclear deal. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=245.1s)]
*  And to do that, we'll do things that they like, like take the Houthi rebels off the [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=247.1s)]
*  terror list and let's do some hostage exchanges and give them $6 billion. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=251.1s)]
*  It's obviously an epic fail. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=256.1s)]
*  But now this is something concerning. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=257.1s)]
*  David Albright, a former U.N. weapons inspector, said this about the current state of the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=259.1s)]
*  Iranian nuclear program. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=264.1s)]
*  The unfortunate reality is that Iran already knows how to build nuclear weapons. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=266.1s)]
*  Today, it would need only about a week to produce enough for its first nuclear weapon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=269.1s)]
*  It could have enough weapons-grade uranium for six weapons in a month, and after five [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=274.1s)]
*  months of producing weapons-grade uranium, it could have enough, as many as 12. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=278.1s)]
*  Does that make you want to react quicker or slow down? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=284.1s)]
*  No. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=291.1s)]
*  I mean, really, if they have nuclear weapons, it's going to be a different ballgame. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=292.1s)]
*  You know, they're going to be off limits. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=296.1s)]
*  And so I think I would be acting quicker. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=298.1s)]
*  Certainly, I would be going after the enriched uranium, but I would also be going after the assets of the regime. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=300.1s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=307.1s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=308.1s)]
*  Jay, why don't you keep this in mind. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=309.1s)]
*  We lost three lives, 34 wounded. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=311.1s)]
*  There's been so many other troops with traumatic brain injuries they call minor. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=314.1s)]
*  That's because it's not their brains. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=319.1s)]
*  I feel bad for the people in this region. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=321.1s)]
*  They deserve to be protected, and obviously they're not. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=323.1s)]
*  They're very susceptible. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=326.1s)]
*  General, thanks so much. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=327.1s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MxN8nGzacs8&t=329.1s)]
