# Ex-Israeli ambassador says Trump, Netanyahu meeting will involve 'far more than Gaza'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo)
*  For more on Netanyahu's upcoming visit and how long it will take to rebuild Gaza, former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=0.0s)]
*  Israeli ambassador to the U.S., Michael Oren joining us now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=9.72s)]
*  Mr. Ambassador, thank you for taking time today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  You heard Trey's report there. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=17.12s)]
*  What do you make of just how high the stakes are with this Trump-Netanyahu meeting on Tuesday? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=20.04s)]
*  Good to be with you, Bruce. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=26.12s)]
*  In fact, the stakes can't get much higher than they are, and I think Trey put his finger [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=27.76s)]
*  on it. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=31.48s)]
*  If you go into the second phase of this ceasefire, what does it mean? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  Israel may get back a number of hostages. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=36.88s)]
*  We have to assume that Hamas is not going to get back all the hostages. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=39.0s)]
*  It's always going to keep a couple of hostages for quote, unquote, a rainy day and say, oh, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  we don't know where the hostages are. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=45.7s)]
*  Let's say Israel can get back most of the hostages, dead and alive, and in return, Hamas [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=47.68000000000001s)]
*  basically takes over the Gaza Strip again. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=53.92s)]
*  That's the, it is a no-win proposition from the state of Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=57.08s)]
*  For the majority of Israelis now, according to the polls, they would prefer that the government [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=62.32s)]
*  actually agrees to the second phase of the ceasefire, get the hostages back, give the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=66.4s)]
*  army a rest, pile up the ammunition, and wait for Hamas to break the ceasefire, because [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=70.5s)]
*  Hamas always breaks the ceasefire. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=75.2s)]
*  Hamas broke the ceasefire on October 7th, 2023. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=77.16s)]
*  It always breaks the ceasefire. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=79.88s)]
*  And then we go in full force, but we get the hostages back. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=81.8s)]
*  In the government, though, and I think this is what Trey was getting at, there are right-wing [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=85.36s)]
*  factions in that government that says if the fighting does not resume at the end of the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=88.44s)]
*  first phase, then they will bolt the government and we'll have a government crisis, we'll [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=92.72s)]
*  have elections in the state of Israel, and many, many chaotic things will then transpire. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=97.8s)]
*  But I think also it's important to point out that the meeting between the president and [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=103.9s)]
*  the prime minister, the first meeting of the president with a foreign leader, will deal [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=107.72s)]
*  with far more than just Gaza. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  Gaza is part of a piece of a puzzle that includes Lebanon, it includes the Saudi-Israel peace [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=112.92s)]
*  treaty which is on the table, and above all, and I think the prime minister was intimating [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=117.6s)]
*  this as he was getting on the plane, Iran, Iran, Iran. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=121.8s)]
*  Can there be a U.S.-Israel cooperation in meeting the Iranian threat and eliminating [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=124.76s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear threat? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=129.92000000000002s)]
*  Michael, I think you're really hitting a lot of important points, but as we look to this [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=132.0s)]
*  meeting on Tuesday, again, Netanyahu's position essentially, he vowed to the destruction of [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=138.18s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=145.02s)]
*  That goal has not been met, and Hamas is essentially saying we'd like for the war to end, but we'd [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=146.02s)]
*  like to stay in power. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=151.54000000000002s)]
*  How could possibly a view be taken that the war could end with Hamas in power at all? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  Because if you say, okay, we're going to resume the fighting, you basically have to concede [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  the fact that these hostages are not going to be released, that these very emotional [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=166.42s)]
*  pictures of hostages being reunited with their families will not recur, and that there'll [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=170.26s)]
*  be dozens and dozens of families in Israel who won't have that experience. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=174.94s)]
*  So it's exquisitely painful, and it goes to the DNA of Israel because we care so much [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=178.9s)]
*  about the lives of all of our citizens. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=183.94s)]
*  My own kids will say, oh, we'd rather say we lost the war, but the important thing is [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=186.9s)]
*  we get the hostages back because if not, we won't be able to send our own kids to the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=191.85999999999999s)]
*  army. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=194.78s)]
*  It's that deep. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=195.9s)]
*  It's very, very deep. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=196.9s)]
*  I think one of the ways out of this could be, Bruce, is an agreement on Iran, because [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=198.1s)]
*  if you eliminate Iran as a threat, it basically dries up Hamas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=201.9s)]
*  It dries up Hezbollah. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=204.98000000000002s)]
*  Iran is the source of all of this instability, all of this violence, and until Iran is dealt [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=207.06s)]
*  with and dealt with in a very effective way, violence will not stop. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=212.1s)]
*  It's such an important point, Michael. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=216.18s)]
*  Yesterday, I interviewed former Secretary of State Pompeo, who talked about the fear [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=217.66s)]
*  of more hostages. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=221.78s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  We'll have more hostages if we can't get the Hezbollah to be completely destroyed by the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=226.58s)]
*  Lebanese armed forces and allow the Israeli people, who still aren't living in their homes, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=231.94000000000003s)]
*  Graf, to have 70,000 people still can't go back to the northern part of Israel. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=235.86s)]
*  We have to give the Israelis the capacity to do that, and I am sure Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=239.5s)]
*  is heartened to have President Trump as his counterparty to that and not President Biden. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=243.5s)]
*  And quickly, your reaction? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=248.5s)]
*  He's absolutely right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=250.3s)]
*  And he's right just about the north. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=251.52s)]
*  The Israelis won't go back to the south either. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=253.22s)]
*  This is a small country, right, the size of New Jersey. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=254.58s)]
*  You take off the southern part, the northern part, you're left with virtually nothing. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=257.38s)]
*  And so, yes, Israel is going to have to secure its borders. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=261.02s)]
*  How do you secure those borders? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=264.5s)]
*  You have to deal blows to Hezbollah and to Hamas that will ensure that they can never [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=265.5s)]
*  again attack these populations. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=270.54s)]
*  And you can do this, you know, kinetically, militarily, directly against these terrorist [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=273.16s)]
*  organizations, but at the end of the day, you got to hit their sponsor, whether it's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=277.66s)]
*  the head of the snake, the head of the octopus, whatever metaphor you want to use. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=281.26000000000005s)]
*  There's no way around it. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=285.5s)]
*  And Iran comes back. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=286.90000000000003s)]
*  We're going to be back to October 6, 2023, very, very quickly. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=288.38000000000005s)]
*  All roads lead back to Iran. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=291.70000000000005s)]
*  Dr. Michael Loren, thank you for your time. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=293.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqqOixFtJFo&t=295.78000000000003s)]
