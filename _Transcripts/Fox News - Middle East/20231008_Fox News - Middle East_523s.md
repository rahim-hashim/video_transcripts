# Jim Jordan: There is a ‘special bond’ between American and Israeli people
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E)
*  Now the congressional response says the need for an imminent new speaker of the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=0.0s)]
*  house is heightening this morning in the face of war in the Middle East following [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=3.68s)]
*  the stunning ouster of Congressman Kevin McCarthy. In a motion brought by Florida [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=6.96s)]
*  Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz, eight House Republicans sided with all 208 Democrats to [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=10.96s)]
*  force the removal of McCarthy as speaker. McCarthy says Gaetz has a personal vendetta against him, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=16.4s)]
*  which Gaetz has denied. I spoke with both men on this program in the last month. Watch. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=21.76s)]
*  But it's not something I lay out there that that Matt's mad about an ethics complaint. It's an [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=26.319999999999997s)]
*  ethics complaint that happened in the last Congress that Matt went to other members saying, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=32.72s)]
*  I'm going to try to influence Kevin to get involved in an ethics committee. I can't do it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=36.72s)]
*  It's illegal. My vendetta is against a Washington system that allows corruption to put the interests [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=41.92s)]
*  of lobbyists and PACs above the interests of the American people. Kevin McCarthy facilitates that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=48.64s)]
*  system and I do deeply resent that. House Republicans will meet this Tuesday on a [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=53.52s)]
*  candidate forum. Also a secret ballot is being held on Wednesday. The nominee will need 218 votes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=59.92s)]
*  to succeed. A full House vote is expected later that day on Wednesday. So far, Congressman Jim [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=67.76s)]
*  Jordan and Steve Scalise have announced their candidacy. Joining me right now in this Sunday [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=72.64s)]
*  Morning Futures exclusive is the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Congressman Jim [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=76.56s)]
*  Jordan, who President Trump has endorsed for the speaker's role. Mr. Chairman, thanks very much [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=80.56s)]
*  for being here this morning. Good. Good to be with you, Maria. I want to first get your take on the [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  war in the Middle East, the war on Israel and whether or not this is created a need, a heightened [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  need for an expedited process to get a speaker in place. Well, we need to get a speaker in place as [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=97.12s)]
*  soon as possible. Someone we can unite around, but you're exactly right. I thought Senator Cotton [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  said it best. We need to give Israel the time, the space, the resources so that they can win [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=108.48s)]
*  and win decisively and send a message to these evil people who did this to our great friend and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=113.84s)]
*  great ally, the state of Israel. And understand that every, I think every American is praying for [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=120.48s)]
*  the folks in Israel as we speak right now, but I had the opportunity yesterday to talk to former [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=125.36s)]
*  Ambassador Friedman. I talked to Chairman McCaul. We do need to get together and get the resources [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  there and the support there so Israel can win. This is, there is a special bond between the state [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=135.36s)]
*  of Israel and the American people. I've been to Israel five times. The way we can work together [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=141.36s)]
*  and help them has been, it's been a long history of that. We need to make sure we continue that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=147.20000000000002s)]
*  and help them win this as quickly as possible. Do you support additional funding to Israel? What [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=151.60000000000002s)]
*  do you want to see in terms of that support? What does that look like? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  I want to give them what they need to win. And we've been doing that with David Sling and Iron [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=161.6s)]
*  Dome, these weapon systems that we've worked together with Israel to make sure that they can [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  defend themselves and stave off all these evil terrorists who want to come and attack their, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=170.24s)]
*  the Israeli people. So I want to do what it takes to win this. But I think Senator Cotton was right. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=175.12s)]
*  Typically how these things shake out is after a while there's this push to have Israel restrain [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=182.32s)]
*  themselves. No, not like this. This happened on the 50th anniversary of the Yom Kippur War. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=187.36s)]
*  It happened on Shabbat. This was intentional evil actions by these terrorists. And we need to make [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=194.24s)]
*  sure that they have what they need to win and send a message to stop this kind of ridiculous stuff [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=200.32000000000002s)]
*  and take action against these people who are doing these terrible things. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=206.8s)]
*  Let me turn to the speaker's race and this candidate form on Tuesday and then the vote [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=211.52s)]
*  on Wednesday. Can you walk us through how this plays out? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=216.08s)]
*  Well, I'm running because look, I think I'm the one candidate who can unite our conference and [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=221.12s)]
*  then go tell the American people what we're doing and why it matters to them, why it's important to [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=227.52s)]
*  their family, to their community, to their small business, why it's important what we're doing for [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=232.64000000000001s)]
*  our country. The American people right now, Maria, I think they are so thirsty for leadership. And I [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=236.64000000000001s)]
*  don't think they're seeing it from the White House. I don't think they're getting it from the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=242.8s)]
*  Senate. House Republicans need to unite and show the country that we're fighting for them. Think [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=245.68s)]
*  about what they see every day. Crime in the streets, 10,000 illegals coming across the border [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=250.4s)]
*  every single day, the price of food, what it costs to put gas in their car. I mean, they are hungry [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=255.20000000000002s)]
*  for leadership. We need to come together and show the American people we're fighting for the things [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=262.56s)]
*  they care about that will make a difference for our great country. As speaker of the House, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=267.92s)]
*  what would be your direction in the face of war in the Middle East right now? We are looking at [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=272.64s)]
*  a candidate yourself and Steve Scalise vying for the job. You know, President Trump has endorsed [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=279.44s)]
*  you. He wrote on Truth Social over the weekend that he would like to see you as speaker of the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=284.96s)]
*  House. But tell me what your first directive would be as speaker. To help the state of Israel. There [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  will be some resolution on the floor to support the state of Israel. We will consult with Chairman [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=298.4s)]
*  McCaul. We will consult with the Senate. We'll work with the State Department and the White House. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=302.24s)]
*  But that is something that I think gets bipartisan, bicameral, full support from the United States [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=306.08s)]
*  government because, again, this is our great friend and great ally, the state of Israel. So I think [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=311.6s)]
*  that's front and center. And then, frankly, the next order of business is to deal what's coming on [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=316.16s)]
*  November 17th. And I will outline a plan that I think we have to have. When we walk out of that [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  room next week, we've got to have 218 votes for a Republican speaker, and we've got to have 218 [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=324.96000000000004s)]
*  votes for how we deal with November 17th when the funding bill for the government comes due. We need [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=329.76s)]
*  to have a plan for how we're going to deal with that. And I will outline that in front of my [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=335.92s)]
*  colleagues on Tuesday when we get together. You have been talking with many of your colleagues [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  over the weekend. Steve Scalise is also asking colleagues for their support. Can you give us [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=344.24s)]
*  a sense of whether or not you feel you can, you have those votes? We've got amazing feedback, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=349.59999999999997s)]
*  incredible feedback from our colleagues across the country, across the spectrum in the Republican [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=356.88s)]
*  conference. We've got conservatives to what's termed more moderate members. We've got three [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=361.36s)]
*  committee chairmen for me. I feel very good about that support. And again, I think it boils down to [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=365.76s)]
*  those fundamental questions. Who can unite our conference? Who can bring us together so that we [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=370.32s)]
*  can lead for the American people? And then who can go tell the country what we're doing here, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=373.92s)]
*  the things we're working on, the things that matter to them and how it matters to them, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=379.28000000000003s)]
*  how it impacts them and their family. That's what we're supposed to do in politics. We're [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=382.24s)]
*  supposed to do what we told the people we were going to do. We're supposed to focus on them and [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=387.2s)]
*  help them, their families, their communities. That's our job. That's what we need to focus on. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=392.56s)]
*  Conklin, beyond Israel, beyond the spending fight, many people are looking at President [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=397.6s)]
*  Biden's foreign policy, as well as the corruption that we have seen in plain sight. You have been [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=404.24s)]
*  leading this investigation into the weaponization of our federal agencies. What can you tell us [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=409.52s)]
*  about those investigations now that there is no speaker in place? You may very well be leaving [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  to become the speaker and leaving the judiciary chairman job. Will those investigations be ongoing? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=418.96s)]
*  They sure will. We already, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, we already work closely with [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=427.59999999999997s)]
*  Speaker McCarthy's office. That communication, that collaboration is there. I mean, just on basic [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=431.68s)]
*  things, to get subpoenas issued, you have to consult with the Speaker's Council, the House Council. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=438.88s)]
*  There's already that working together amongst the three key committees, the Ways and Means [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=443.84000000000003s)]
*  committees, the Oversight Committee and Judiciary Committee, and of course the speaker and the [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=448.40000000000003s)]
*  speaker staff and the House Council. So that will continue. That's part of our constitutional duty, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=452.32s)]
*  Maria. We're supposed to provide oversight of the federal agencies, and we've been doing that. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=456.72s)]
*  We've been doing it aggressively. We've been doing it in a way that's consistent with the Constitution, [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=462.56s)]
*  and we've been making a difference. There have been changes in these agencies because of the [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=466.72s)]
*  work we're doing that I think protects Americans' liberties and freedoms. So that work will have to [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=470.32000000000005s)]
*  continue. Are you expecting to subpoena Hunter Biden? That will be a call for the committee [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=475.52000000000004s)]
*  chairman right now. Chairman Comer has subpoenaed Hunter Biden's business records. He wants to get [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  that information and then make a decision on that subpoena. But those come from, the Speaker of the [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=487.52000000000004s)]
*  House doesn't issue subpoenas. The chairman of the respective committees issue those. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=491.92s)]
*  And I'll be fully supportive that Chairman Comer wants to go that direction. Congressman, thank you. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=496.72s)]
*  We'll be watching important upcoming days. Congressman Jim Jordan, thank you for being here [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=501.20000000000005s)]
*  this morning. We appreciate it. Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. Catch me and my co-hosts [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywucSsNdf6E&t=505.76000000000005s)]
