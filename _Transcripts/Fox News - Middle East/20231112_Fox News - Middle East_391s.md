# Alex Safian to Levin: The New York Times has a 'serious Jewish problem'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA)
*  Welcome back America. Alex Safin is associate director and research director of CAMERA, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=0.0s)]
*  Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting and Analysis. And they're doing a fantastic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=10.92s)]
*  job by bookmarking their site because they're monitoring what the media are doing and what [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=15.18s)]
*  they're reporting and they're providing that to we the American people. So I think it's [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  important that we hear about this. Alex, for the most part, how are the American media doing? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=24.28s)]
*  Not well. Not well. There are exceptions here and there, but for the most part, not well at all. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=30.68s)]
*  Here's a telling example. It's a window into the mind of Christian Amanpour, if you're willing to [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=35.6s)]
*  take that risk. Christian Amanpour has been talking about Palestinian casualties. Many in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  the media now are saying the Hamas controlled Gaza Ministry of Health to make clear that maybe [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=49.8s)]
*  the numbers are not that reliable. Christian Amanpour has found a way around that. She says, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=54.919999999999995s)]
*  according to the Palestinian Ministry of Health in Ramallah, that's what she's quoting for casualty [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=60.879999999999995s)]
*  numbers, but where do they get their numbers? They're not on the ground in Gaza. They're [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=66.36s)]
*  getting the numbers from the Hamas controlled Ministry of Health. So she is laundering the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=70.84s)]
*  casualty statistics. Instead of saying these are Hamas numbers, she's saying it comes from the PA [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=77.96s)]
*  in Ramallah trying to launder the numbers. Now, why would she do that? Why would she go out of [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=84.28s)]
*  her way to make Israel look as bad as possible and make the Palestinian side look as good as [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  possible by covering up the fact that these are very unreliable Hamas numbers? These are propaganda [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  numbers coming out of Hamas in Gaza. She does this all the time. This is one example of where [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=102.08s)]
*  she does her best to make Israel look as bad as possible and make the Palestinians look as good [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=109.12s)]
*  as possible. This, unfortunately, is typical of a lot of what goes on on CNN. Not everything, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=113.84s)]
*  not every report, but the majority of reports, the vast majority of reports, and she's just a typical [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=119.72s)]
*  example of that. I can give you another example that this is, again, a window into the mind of [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=125.36s)]
*  these reporters. New York Times Middle East correspondent Raja Abdul Rahim, she tweeted the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=130.96s)]
*  following on November 6th, siege bombardment, striking bakeries, targeting hospitals, preventing [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=136.16s)]
*  aid. We've seen these military tactics before in Syria. She is comparing Israel to Syria, which is [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=142.84s)]
*  incredible. Now, she has a history. When she was in college, she actually wrote a letter to her [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=151.48000000000002s)]
*  college newspaper saying that Hamas and Hezbollah are not terrorist organizations. She said this [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=157.12s)]
*  when she was on a scholarship from CARE, the Committee on American-Islamic Relations, which, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=163.0s)]
*  of course, you've talked about it a lot, is a Hamas front group and is an unindicted co-conspirator [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=169.0s)]
*  in the largest terrorism findings and trial in our country's history. So that's how you get hired [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=175.28s)]
*  at the New York Times or the LA Times first, where her first job, and then the New York Times. It [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=179.84s)]
*  having opinions like that and claiming that Hamas and Hezbollah are not terrorist groups is not [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=186.6s)]
*  disqualifying if you want to get a job at the New York Times, the LA Times, or Amnesty International, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  or Human Rights Watch, which are all a huge part of the problem in this propaganda war against Israel. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  Now, let's talk about the New York Times for a moment. There have been many scholars who've [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=203.44s)]
*  written very thorough books that are absolutely unchallenged on how the New York Times covered up [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=207.32s)]
*  the Holocaust for the most part. The New York Times put out an apology in 2001, which was a [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=213.72s)]
*  semi-apology on its 150th year anniversary. It just seems to me, if you're going to cover up the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=219.32s)]
*  Holocaust, then that rots pretty deep at the New York Times. The New York Times hired and then fired [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=225.88s)]
*  a man who was praising Hitler, who was a photographer for them in Gaza, and they just hired this guy back. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=232.8s)]
*  The New York Times put out anti-Semitic cartoons, not one, two. They said it's apologized for them. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=239.68s)]
*  What do you make of the New York Times? The whole culture there seems to be really corrupt. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=248.52s)]
*  It is. They have a serious Jewish problem because the ownership, the Salzburger family, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=255.08s)]
*  has a Jewish history, which they're very uncomfortable with. This has been going back to the 1920s, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=260.68s)]
*  when they actually stuck up for some Jewish interests and spoke out against the anti-Semitism, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=267.6s)]
*  and got slammed as being Jews, as being unreliable, as only taking a Jewish point of view on things. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=272.96s)]
*  Ever since then, really, the New York Times has tried to bend over backwards to show that they are [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=281.76s)]
*  not a particularly Jewish newspaper or Jewish ownership newspaper. The ownership is really the [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=287.04s)]
*  problem here. It's been true through the generations, and the people that you mentioned [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=292.52000000000004s)]
*  who've written about it, they've covered this. I mean, it's well known that they have a real [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=298.36s)]
*  Jewish problem. There's no question about it. It was true with the riots in New York, the anti-Jewish [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=302.76s)]
*  pogrom that Al Sharpton helped trigger in New York, where they did not cover what was going on. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=307.96000000000004s)]
*  They covered it as fighting between Jews and blacks in New York, and that was not what was [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=313.16s)]
*  happening. It was a pogrom, an anti-Jewish pogrom, and the New York Times for days didn't cover it, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=318.36s)]
*  as even some of their own reporters later came out and said. They were calling in stories, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=324.04s)]
*  and that was not what was being published by the paper. The paper was not publishing the stories [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=328.6s)]
*  that were called in by their reporters. So there's no question they have a Jewish problem, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=332.6s)]
*  and they have an Israel problem. There's no question about it, and we see that in their [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=337.16s)]
*  coverage over and over again. They lead journalism in the world and in America for sure, and that's [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  where the problem really starts. When we come back, Alex Safian of camera.org, I want to ask [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=345.24s)]
*  you about MSNBC, which to me is also a particularly grotesque so-called journalism operation. The hosts [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=350.84000000000003s)]
*  that they have there, the propaganda that they push, it seems to be to me really filled with hate [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=359.56s)]
*  towards Israel, not hate for America, quite frankly. We'll be right back. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=368.04s)]
*  Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzJLc-OZMQA&t=375.72s)]
