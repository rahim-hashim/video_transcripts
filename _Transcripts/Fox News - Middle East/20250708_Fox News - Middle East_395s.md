# ‘MUCH MORE HARSH’: Mother reveals dire conditions son faces in Hamas captivity
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI)
*  There's reports that you're meeting with Netanyahu again tonight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=0.0s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=5.0s)]
*  Yeah, I am. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=6.0s)]
*  He's going to come over again tonight. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=7.0s)]
*  We're talking about Gaza. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=8.0s)]
*  Mostly Gaza right now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=9.0s)]
*  But we've got to get that solved. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=10.0s)]
*  Gaza is a tragic — it's a tragedy. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=11.88s)]
*  It's a tragedy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=15.52s)]
*  And he wants to get it solved, and I want to get it solved. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=17.14s)]
*  And I think the other side wants to get it solved. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=19.72s)]
*  President Trump is getting ready for a second meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=22.88s)]
*  Netanyahu. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=26.1s)]
*  Let's push for a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas taking center stage. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=27.1s)]
*  For people like our next guest, whose son is still a hostage in Hamas captivity, that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=32.02s)]
*  deal cannot come soon enough. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=36.22s)]
*  Let's bring in Edith Ohel, the mother of Alon Ohel. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=37.82s)]
*  Thanks so much for being with us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=41.22s)]
*  I know that you came here to Washington, D.C., because you said that you wanted to look decision-makers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=42.38s)]
*  in the eye. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=47.34s)]
*  I don't know how many people you've had a chance to meet with, but you've got the microphone [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=48.34s)]
*  now. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=52.980000000000004s)]
*  What would you like to say to them? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  Well, mostly it's that I miss my son. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=55.379999999999995s)]
*  I haven't seen him, heard from him, talked to him, or — more than 640 days. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=59.3s)]
*  Alon has been in the tunnels for that much of a time, in 40 meters under the ground, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=66.89999999999999s)]
*  a very cramped place. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=72.58s)]
*  Has not seen the sunlight, has not seen breath, you know, fresh air for that long. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=74.66s)]
*  And I'm scared for him. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=80.97999999999999s)]
*  He's injured. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=82.42s)]
*  He has a light-fitting injury. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=83.98s)]
*  His eye — he doesn't see in one eye. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=86.34s)]
*  He has sharp nails all over his body. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=88.26s)]
*  He's being starved, chained in his legs so he can't move. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=90.5s)]
*  And you know, it's heartbreaking. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=96.14s)]
*  You know, I feel that I have — you know, I have no control of what's with him, what's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=99.7s)]
*  going on with him. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=104.86s)]
*  And I feel sometimes that I don't even know what to do. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=107.74000000000001s)]
*  It's been so long. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=112.02s)]
*  But Alon is strong. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=113.82s)]
*  Alon is strong. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  He's fighting, you know. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  He's a pianist, so he's playing on his chest to survive. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=119.61999999999999s)]
*  That's what hostages that returned tell me that were with him. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=125.1s)]
*  There were three other hostages that returned and said a lot about Alon and how he's coping. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=128.9s)]
*  And now he's alone in the tunnels. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=136.26s)]
*  He was kidnapped from the Nova Music Festival on October the 7th and taken to Gaza by Hamas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=138.78s)]
*  You say that you've heard about his condition from other hostages who were in captivity [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=145.62s)]
*  with him. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=152.14000000000001s)]
*  You mentioned that he lost an eye when he was kidnapped. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=153.22s)]
*  He had a severe head wound as well. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=156.06s)]
*  But your understanding is that he is still alive and that he is doing okay. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=158.06s)]
*  I don't know what's doing okay when you're in this situation, but he's surviving. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=163.82s)]
*  He's definitely trying to survive terrible things that he's going through. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=169.22s)]
*  You know, I had an opportunity to meet Yidan Alexander on Thursday, who just recently returned [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=173.82s)]
*  to the United States from being in captivity almost as long as Alon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=180.02s)]
*  He was in pretty good condition. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=184.74s)]
*  It's different. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=186.5s)]
*  When he came out. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=187.5s)]
*  Is it different with Alon? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=188.5s)]
*  It's different. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=189.5s)]
*  It is different. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=190.5s)]
*  If you've seen Ali Sharby when he came out, he was 30 kilos. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=191.5s)]
*  It's in a different place. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=196.14s)]
*  I don't even know, but it's different. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=198.7s)]
*  Alon is injured. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=201.14s)]
*  Alon had been taken from a bomb shelter where he was thrown grenades into the bomb shelter. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=202.98s)]
*  I saw that video. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=210.18s)]
*  RPGs. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=211.18s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=212.18s)]
*  That's the same bomb shelter where Hirsch Goldemberg-Perling was taken from, a hostage. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=213.18s)]
*  So it's a little bit different. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=219.54s)]
*  He's in much more harsh conditions than Yidan Alexander. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=221.18s)]
*  So we know that Steve Witkoff is going to Qatar later on this week. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=224.58s)]
*  He is optimistic that potentially a ceasefire and a hostage deal can be put together. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=228.70000000000002s)]
*  This is what he said at the cabinet meeting a short time ago. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=233.26000000000002s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=235.3s)]
*  We had four issues and now we're down to one after two days of proximity talks. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=236.3s)]
*  So we are hopeful that by the end of this week, we will have an agreement that will [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=241.70000000000002s)]
*  bring us into a 60 day ceasefire. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=246.06s)]
*  Ten live hostages will be released. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=249.26s)]
*  Nine deceased will be released. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=252.17999999999998s)]
*  We think that this will lead to a lasting peace in Gaza. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=255.66s)]
*  I'm sure that potentially gives you hope. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=259.9s)]
*  However, we know that there are probably 23 hostages who are still living in the tunnels [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=261.97999999999996s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=267.38s)]
*  Ten might be released as a result of this deal. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=268.38s)]
*  But it's maybe 50-50. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=272.14s)]
*  But do you have hope that Alon may be among the ten that are released? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=274.78s)]
*  I always have hope. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=278.58000000000004s)]
*  Alon is injured and it's crucial that he will be brought home so he can get medical attention. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=280.3s)]
*  Alon has never gotten any medical attention. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=287.3s)]
*  The ICRC has never seen Alon. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=289.70000000000005s)]
*  So he still has a sharp nail in his eye that has not been taken out. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=292.34000000000003s)]
*  It's crucial that he comes home and get the medical attention. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  I'm hopeful all the time. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=301.22s)]
*  I will never give hope. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=303.26s)]
*  I will never give hope until I see my son alive. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=304.74s)]
*  He is coming home alive. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=308.06s)]
*  That's what I feel and that's what I know. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=309.7s)]
*  There's nothing else that I'm thinking about these whole times. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=312.38s)]
*  You have to understand, like, as a mother, not being able to say anything to your son, [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=316.26s)]
*  even not being able to be there as a shield against so people don't hit him, to give [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=322.74s)]
*  him food when he needs. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=328.46s)]
*  I can't do these, like, elementary things that a mother needs to do to her son. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=329.9s)]
*  I can't imagine how difficult it is. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=334.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=336.62s)]
*  So I will keep fighting and making sure that he comes home. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=337.62s)]
*  He needs to come home and continue with his life. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=341.74s)]
*  And we will be praying for you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=344.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=345.38s)]
*  We will be praying for you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=346.38s)]
*  Hopefully. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=347.38s)]
*  And I want to just one thing to say. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=348.38s)]
*  I want to say I'm here because of President Trump. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=349.38s)]
*  I am so, you know, he's a wonderful person who is trying to help my son and all the other [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=353.82s)]
*  hostages, bringing them home. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=361.94s)]
*  He's convinced that he can do it and I believe that he can do it. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=363.86s)]
*  And I'm with him. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=368.22s)]
*  That's why I'm here, because I know that he is the person that can bring them home, and [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=369.98s)]
*  his staff, obviously. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=374.34000000000003s)]
*  We pray that you will get good news as a result of what Mr. Wyckoff is doing. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=376.14000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=380.02000000000004s)]
*  Edith, thank you for being with us. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0SVWZhl8hvI&t=381.02000000000004s)]
