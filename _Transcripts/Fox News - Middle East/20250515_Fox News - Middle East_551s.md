# NEW: Trump says US 'getting close' to nuclear deal with Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc)
*  Straight to a Fox News alert any minute now President Trump will speak to U.S. troops at Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar or in Qatar before heading to Abu Dhabi for the third leg of his historic Middle East trip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=0.0s)]
*  So the president already striking a massive Boeing deal with Qatar while Iran says they're ready to sign a nuclear deal. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=16.0s)]
*  All right, Lucas Tomlinson just mentioned by Kevin Cork moments ago is live at the air base with the latest. Hey Lucas. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=24.0s)]
*  Well good afternoon guys from Al Udeid Air Base the largest in the Middle East a much quieter base with no wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and ISIS defeated and President Trump would like to keep it that way. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=31.0s)]
*  We heard from his remarks earlier. He wants this to be a trip about commerce, not conflict. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=44.0s)]
*  And we've seen the commerce. The Saudis first pledging over 600 billion dollars now right here in Qatar. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=49.0s)]
*  The Emir saying he's going to up that to one point two trillion. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=55.0s)]
*  So President Trump is due here to address the troops here. Soldiers and Airmen Al Udeid Air Base. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=59.0s)]
*  But before coming here, President Trump spoke with business leaders in Qatar where he says he's close to a nuclear deal with Iran. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=65.0s)]
*  Of course, Iran not far away and Qatar and Iran share the largest gas field in the Persian Gulf. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=73.0s)]
*  That's why these countries want to see a deal happen. Here is President Trump earlier. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=78.0s)]
*  I think we're getting close to maybe doing a deal without having to do this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=83.0s)]
*  There's two steps is a very, very nice step. And there's a violent step, the violence like people haven't seen before. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=88.0s)]
*  And I don't I hope we're not going to have to do this. I don't want to do the second step. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=95.0s)]
*  We're in very serious negotiations with Iran for long term peace. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=100.0s)]
*  And keep in mind, guys, for content. It was just a few weeks ago when President Trump was posting on social about bombing Iran. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=109.0s)]
*  Now you don't hear that word here in the region. In addition to the business deals, diplomacy on the agenda, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=115.0s)]
*  President Trump meeting the new president of Syria in Riyadh, who six months ago had a 10 million dollar bounty on his head running an al Qaeda affiliate in Syria. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=120.0s)]
*  Now he says he wants the U.S. to invest in his country, keep Iran out. Now that the Assad regime is gone, Trump said he will remove sanctions on Syria. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=129.0s)]
*  Here's the president earlier here in Qatar. Syria, we took out the sanctions and that's been I didn't even realize. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=137.0s)]
*  It's been many, many years that they've had sanctions. And as you know, there was a very big change at the top. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=143.0s)]
*  And I thought that we have to give them a chance. They really have no chance with the sanctions. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=150.0s)]
*  Of course, those sanctions went back four decades, not just to a side of the whole Assad family. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=155.0s)]
*  Now here's the headline from NBC. Top Iranian official says Tehran would forego highly enriched uranium and nuclear deal with Trump. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=161.0s)]
*  So that's big news because, of course, President Trump, we heard from Senator Cotton, we've heard from the Trump administration. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=169.0s)]
*  They do not want to see Iran enriching uranium. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=174.0s)]
*  Perhaps this leaves the possibility of some kind of enrichment outside the country and freeing up Iran potentially to be able to build nuclear reactors. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=178.0s)]
*  But we are just moments away from President Trump coming here to Al Udeid. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=186.0s)]
*  We've had a few warm up backs. We had Lee Greenwood. I don't know why we didn't see him on the stage in Riyadh, but he's here in Al Udeid firing up the troops. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=190.0s)]
*  We also had Theo Vaughn fresh off his big lunch in Miami with Ivanka and Jared, guys. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=197.0s)]
*  Wow, I did not know that. The podcast of Theo Vaughn. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=202.0s)]
*  And, Luke, let me ask you something. In terms of troops, I know when we're at war, there's like 10,000, there's a capability of 10,000, 20,000 troops. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=205.0s)]
*  What do you think the capacity is now? What is the American presence like there? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=213.0s)]
*  Well, there's certainly not that many. You don't see the bombers on the ramp like you did in the fall, Brian. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=219.0s)]
*  When Iran, of course, launched the largest ballistic missile attack in world history against Israel in the fall, some B-52 bombers were here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=225.0s)]
*  Now it's really just refueling planes, KC-135s, some reconnaissance aircraft. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=232.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can see behind me, there's a Reaper drone. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=237.0s)]
*  Of course, we've lost a few of those in the past few months in bombardment against the Houthis, but certainly a much more peaceful scene here. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=240.0s)]
*  Far different cry from decades ago in the height of the Iraq and Afghan wars. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=248.0s)]
*  And then don't forget about ISIS. Don't forget about President Trump dropping the mother of all bombs on ISIS in eastern Afghanistan. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=252.0s)]
*  But I digress, Brian. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=258.0s)]
*  Lucas, I like the way you set it up. You said the president has given them the option of commerce over conflict. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=259.0s)]
*  But he also, and I love the sign behind it because it's something that the president says often, peace through strength. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=268.0s)]
*  He's not funding the military. He's making them strong. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=274.0s)]
*  But he wants to give these countries a way out, a relationship with money. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=279.0s)]
*  There's no question. And let's not forget credit to the men and women of the U.S. military. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=283.0s)]
*  One of the reasons it has been peaceful recently is because of the U.S. military. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=289.0s)]
*  You've got two aircraft carrier strike groups. Let's not forget about the Navy guys. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=293.0s)]
*  We've got the Harry S. Truman off the coast of Saudi Arabia in the Red Sea, Carl Vinson off the coast of Oman. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=296.0s)]
*  Of course, you've got destroyer, cruiser escorts, some submarines in there as well. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=302.0s)]
*  So there's a lot of firepower assembled in this area. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=306.0s)]
*  President Trump had to cease fire with the Houthis. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=309.0s)]
*  Back to your point, though, Lawrence, business deals are on the agenda here. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=312.0s)]
*  We have $600 billion pledged from the Saudis. Saudi Crown Prince spent the entire day with President Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=316.0s)]
*  That doesn't just happen. Met him on the ramp when he stepped off Air Force One. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=321.0s)]
*  We saw the escort with the Saudi F-15s. We actually have a Qatari F-15 over there. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=325.0s)]
*  Not sure that was the one that took part. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=329.0s)]
*  Was one of the plane mates with Air Force One on the approach here to Qatar. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=331.0s)]
*  But it's been full diplomatic, military recognition. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=335.0s)]
*  All the pomp and circumstance that the Qataris can muster. We saw the same in Saudis. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=339.0s)]
*  Let's not forget that camel contingent, guys, here in Qatar. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=343.0s)]
*  It was a pretty impressive formation. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=346.0s)]
*  And there's Theo von right there. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=348.0s)]
*  And also the stallions. You had the Arabian signs in Saudi Arabia. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=351.0s)]
*  I'm not sure those were stallions or geldings, though, Ainsley. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=354.0s)]
*  What I love about this, Lucas, is we've seen our president meeting with other leaders from other countries. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=357.0s)]
*  And now he's going to the biggest military base there in Qatar before he heads to the UAE. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=362.0s)]
*  He's going to go shake hands with the men and women who have given up so much to fight for our country. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=368.0s)]
*  They've left their families, some of them, for 18 months, for a year and a half. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=373.0s)]
*  So what is the feeling there? What are people saying to you? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=377.0s)]
*  I was talking to some of the airmen, some of the soldiers earlier. They're fired up. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=383.0s)]
*  They're here. They want to see the president. I spoke to one airman. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=386.0s)]
*  He said he just got off a 12-hour watch, Ainsley. He could have just jumped in the rack. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=388.0s)]
*  Instead, he's here. He wants to see his commander in chief. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=392.0s)]
*  And by the way, President Trump doesn't have to be here. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=395.0s)]
*  He could have easily flown over the base, gone from Doha to where, you know, we're about an hour away from Doha. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=397.0s)]
*  He could have gone from Doha to Abu Dhabi to the United Arab Emirates. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=402.0s)]
*  There's more money waiting there. They're not going to be outdone by the Qataris. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=405.0s)]
*  I'm sure they're pledging some $1.4 trillion, right? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=409.0s)]
*  But the president's here because clearly he wants to thank the men and women of the U.S. military. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=412.0s)]
*  That's why he's coming here. And the crowd's pretty fired up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=417.0s)]
*  And people are excited to see him, although they might have to refresh the playlists. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=419.0s)]
*  He guns and roses. That's more our generation. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=423.0s)]
*  Gloria. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=425.0s)]
*  And if he could do that, so that is definitely not your playlist. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=426.0s)]
*  So we'll make sure that. Lucas, lastly, this is going to be, it seems like he's... [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=429.0s)]
*  Brought back good memories. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=433.0s)]
*  Yes. The text of the speech will be more like a rally, you think? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=434.0s)]
*  There's no question. Definitely a rally. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=439.0s)]
*  I think that's why you're here in this playlist. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=442.0s)]
*  We've heard a similar play set on different campaign stops. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=444.0s)]
*  He's also here to thank the troops, here to fire them up. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=447.0s)]
*  Obviously, this can't be a complete political speech. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=449.0s)]
*  You have the men and women of the U.S. military here. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=451.0s)]
*  I think you'll hear a lot of thanks and gratitude for keeping the peace. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=453.0s)]
*  Because remember the nightmare of the fall. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=457.0s)]
*  It's easy how we just move on from this stuff. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=459.0s)]
*  But remember when Iran was firing 180 ballistic missiles not far away into Israel. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=461.0s)]
*  And the Arab states rallied, but also the U.S. military. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=466.0s)]
*  And remember, when people were a little nervous about Iran getting that scrap, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=469.0s)]
*  they've ordered, you know, there were 73 plane loads of Patriot service [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=473.0s)]
*  to air missiles that were flown in here to help protect the Gulf allies. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=477.0s)]
*  And also with the deals, it's not just commerce, not just artificial intelligence. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=480.0s)]
*  We saw many members of the Fortune 500, which again, guys, they didn't have to be here. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=484.0s)]
*  You can't just tell CEOs of all these companies to show up here in the Middle East. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=488.0s)]
*  We're a long way from home. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=492.0s)]
*  And they're here that says a lot about President Trump, says a lot about his influence, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=493.0s)]
*  that they flew halfway across the world to be here. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=498.0s)]
*  But also in from the military aspect, you know, they're keeping the peace. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=501.0s)]
*  They want to keep it that way, guys. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=505.0s)]
*  Before we let you go, Lucas, what's this song? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=507.0s)]
*  It's funny. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=509.0s)]
*  Do you know? Do you recognize it? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=510.0s)]
*  Yeah, nothing compares to you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=512.0s)]
*  Stop the music, Tomlinson. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=513.0s)]
*  Look at those. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=514.0s)]
*  I'm failing this right here. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=515.0s)]
*  Nothing compares to you. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=517.0s)]
*  Is that what the song is called? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ivUpSbvtnQc&t=519.0s)]
