# IDF spokesperson: This is another example of how low Hamas will go
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM)
*  So right now as we wait for more news on these 10 hostages who some there's some kind of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=0.0s)]
*  holdup and we're not sure exactly what it is. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=8.42s)]
*  So we'll continue to dig into that story for you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=11.1s)]
*  But right now the Israeli military is investigating this heartbreaking claim by Hamas that 10 [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=14.38s)]
*  month old baby Kfeer Bebas, the youngest of all the hostages who has spent a fifth of [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=22.38s)]
*  his life in their captivity, also his mother Sheree and another toddler, Ariel, his adorable [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=28.02s)]
*  brother in the middle picture that you see on our wall. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=36.34s)]
*  There are reports that they have been killed. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=39.54s)]
*  These are not confirmed. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=42.18s)]
*  Of course, everyone is hoping and praying that this is not the case. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=44.34s)]
*  The IDF saying the barbarism and cruelty of Hamas is on full display as everybody in the [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=47.7s)]
*  world has watched this family and others. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=55.38s)]
*  So let's go live to Tel Aviv and Major Doran Spielman, IDF international spokesman. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=58.56s)]
*  Major, good to have you with us again today. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=63.74s)]
*  We all sort of catch our breath when we see this report. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=67.22s)]
*  What can you tell us? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=71.78s)]
*  What do you know? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=72.78s)]
*  First of all, thank you for having me. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=75.7s)]
*  This is, as you mentioned, a heartbreaking story from the get go. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=78.02000000000001s)]
*  of hundreds, but especially given the ages of these sweet little children. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=82.24s)]
*  On October 7th, Kfeer, who's 10 months old now and his three-year-old brother, the mother [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=87.11999999999999s)]
*  and father were in their pastoral community located just a few kilometers from the Gaza [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=92.44s)]
*  Strip when terrorists literally yanked them out of their beds and pulled them out of the [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=96.47999999999999s)]
*  home. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=101.08s)]
*  In fact, a video was taken showing the mother Sheree holding this little baby and her son [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=102.08s)]
*  to her chest. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  And that's the last we've seen of them since they were hauled off into Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=109.24s)]
*  A particularly cruel gesture, even for a horribly cruel organization. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=112.44s)]
*  I'm sorry, Major, but I just want to show people this video that you're watching. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=116.91999999999999s)]
*  This is Sheree and her two sons, Ariel and Kfeer. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=121.72s)]
*  You can see the terror on her face. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=125.63999999999999s)]
*  And the word is that, the story that we have heard is that she was in the bomb shelter [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=127.72s)]
*  with her boys. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=132.24s)]
*  That's why she has a blanket wrapped around herself and both of them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=133.24s)]
*  This is Hamas with their hands on her family, taking them away from their home. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  And the husband was seeking safety. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=142.66s)]
*  He put all of them in the bomb shelter. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=145.48s)]
*  So what do we know now, Major? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=148.22s)]
*  How do you go about trying to confirm this report from Hamas? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  We do have, we had initial information at the beginning of the week, which we did release, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=155.7s)]
*  that they had been traded by Hamas to another organization and they were being held somewhere [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=161.38s)]
*  in the southern Gaza Strip. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=167.01999999999998s)]
*  Then today Hamas made this announcement that they had been killed. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=168.82s)]
*  Again, our hearts are with the family. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=172.5s)]
*  We're assessing this based on all of our intelligence, both people on the ground, the information, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=174.62s)]
*  all the ways that we've been able to gather intelligence now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=180.7s)]
*  And part of that are the reports that Hamas puts out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=183.18s)]
*  But we know these reports have often been wrong. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=185.7s)]
*  We're certainly hoping that this one is wrong. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=188.46s)]
*  But this is another example. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=191.36s)]
*  Not only was this family ripped out of their beds, the movie, the video that you showed [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=193.0s)]
*  us, but they were kept in an area by Hamas strategically to protect them, their efforts. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=198.48000000000002s)]
*  The terrorists use these families to protect them. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=205.08s)]
*  And if they were hurt, it is just another example of how low Hamas will go in order [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=208.60000000000002s)]
*  to try to cover their terrorist efforts. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=214.12s)]
*  Even a 10-month-old baby is not out of question for them. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=216.42s)]
*  All right. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=220.98s)]
*  Doran Spielman, Major, thank you very much. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=222.29999999999998s)]
*  We will continue to wait for more information, obviously. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=225.66s)]
*  Very hard to deal with Hamas and get clear communication despite the fact that these [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=230.04s)]
*  exchanges keep going on. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=234.22s)]
*  So thank you very much, Major. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=235.85999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMKfxhV61HM&t=238.77999999999997s)]
