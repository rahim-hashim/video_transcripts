# Saudi Arabia rejects White House plea to increase oil production
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ)
*  The Charlie Gasparino on the financial implications of this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Now, Charlie, you've been talking to a lot of Wall Street types who are saying that to [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=2.58s)]
*  a man and woman, they've been warning, urging the administration, boost production here [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=6.48s)]
*  so we don't have to depend on OPEC and the various types over there. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=11.02s)]
*  It's fallen on deaf ears, apparently. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=15.26s)]
*  Right. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=16.94s)]
*  And lay off the harshest rhetoric. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=17.94s)]
*  I mean, listen, take it for what it's worth and take it from the source, I should say. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=19.46s)]
*  All these Wall Street firms have lots of dealings in Saudi Arabia, in the Middle East. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=23.32s)]
*  They have a lot riding on this. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=28.16s)]
*  They, the royal family, as you know, runs a major company, like a hedge fund, essentially, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=29.4s)]
*  Saudi Aramco. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=34.8s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what it's called now, but it throws out a lot of fees. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=35.8s)]
*  So there's a lot of stuff that goes on between Wall Street, the banks here in the U.S., and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=40.76s)]
*  the Saudi royal family. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=45.4s)]
*  That said, they also know how to deal with these guys. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=47.08s)]
*  And their message is simply this, Neil. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=49.84s)]
*  We can't have both a foreign policy and a domestic oil policy that both attacks a major [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=53.26s)]
*  producer who was an ally of ours, maybe over the right thing, which was the Khashoggi murder. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=60.3s)]
*  I get it that MBS is likely the responsible party for that. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=67.38s)]
*  But if you're going to go green and reduce oil output here, do everything you can to [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=73.4s)]
*  discourage oil exploration and drilling here, going after the royal family is kind of a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=79.26s)]
*  non-starter. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=85.86s)]
*  Also, from a foreign policy standpoint, again, I'm not an expert of foreign policy. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=86.86s)]
*  These Wall Street guys know it because they have to know it. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=90.46000000000001s)]
*  Saudi Arabia has always been an ally against Iran in the Middle East, the most belligerent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=95.26s)]
*  player there. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=99.04s)]
*  So we're going to essentially alienate an ally that's standing between us and Iran, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=100.14s)]
*  and also basically annoy them to the fact that they're going to cut back on production [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=106.78s)]
*  when we need them to increase production. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=110.92s)]
*  So this is kind of what you hear. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=113.14s)]
*  They're not exactly the standard bearers of niceness with us or diplomatic. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=116.34s)]
*  I'm just wondering, though, how far does Wall Street worry or financial guys worry that [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=122.7s)]
*  we alienate the Saudis or are they kowtowing to the Saudis? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=128.34s)]
*  It's one thing to kowtow, which no one's expecting to kowtow, but at some point what they're [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=133.9s)]
*  saying is, you know, lay off because we need them in a lot of different ways. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=138.5s)]
*  They are a major player in global economics. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=143.1s)]
*  They have been an ally against Iran and Iran's ambitions in the Middle East, which is far [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=146.42000000000002s)]
*  more expansionary and dangerous than what the Saudis are doing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=152.16s)]
*  Yes, it was a tragedy what happened to Khashoggi, but at some point, you know, this is the hand [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=156.06s)]
*  we're dealing with here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=160.82s)]
*  Are we really looking for regime change in Saudi Arabia? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=163.02s)]
*  And the bottom line is a lot of these guys are saying the president could have avoided [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=166.5s)]
*  this by not abandoning, as they see it, abandoning our production here to make us more dependent [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=169.66s)]
*  on the Saudis and other guys. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=175.70000000000002s)]
*  If you're going to abandon our production here, don't annoy an ally that produces a [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  lot of oil. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=182.74s)]
*  I mean, that's kind of the simple common sense. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=183.74s)]
*  They would also like a chilling of the, not a chilling, but that's the wrong word, but [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=185.62s)]
*  they would like a little bit of amends that should occur here. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=190.94s)]
*  Everyone dial it down, dial it down a notch or two. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=193.54s)]
*  Charlie, thank you very, very much. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=195.98s)]
*  Charlie Gasparino following all those developments here. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2Hr67_Y8eQ&t=197.78s)]
