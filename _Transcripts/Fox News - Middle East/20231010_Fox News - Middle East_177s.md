# Drone expert warns Hamas' attack against Israel will 'backfire'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA)
*  Let us bring in former special operations Intel analyst and drone expert Brett Velikovitch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=0.0s)]
*  Brett, great to have you as always. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=5.26s)]
*  You heard Alex get into a little bit of detail there about the weapons we could be sending [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=10.46s)]
*  Kevin McCarthy getting into some more detail as well. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=11.46s)]
*  But you're the weapons expert here among the three of us. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=13.56s)]
*  What exactly do the Israelis need from us in detail to fight the fight that they're [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=16.54s)]
*  about to fight? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=21.94s)]
*  Hey Todd, thanks for having me. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=22.94s)]
*  And first let me say my heart goes out to your last guest that was saddened by her story [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=25.94s)]
*  as just disgusting what has happened to her family and others over there with Hamas taking [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=29.78s)]
*  these innocent people hostage. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=34.300000000000004s)]
*  Their incursion into Israel frankly is going to backfire. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=37.300000000000004s)]
*  Hamas is one day of glory, it's over. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=39.82s)]
*  Israel is about to hammer them. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=42.3s)]
*  And this time it's going to be a lot different than previously going in there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=44.06s)]
*  Their forces are going to take their time, they're going to go block to block. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=46.620000000000005s)]
*  And we need to support them not only publicly but from the government. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=49.5s)]
*  I think the US military strike force moving an aircraft carrier with warships and guided [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  cruise missiles into the Mediterranean is a start. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=59.42s)]
*  It provides a message of deterrence. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=61.620000000000005s)]
*  The US needs to make it very clear that that's not just a show of force either but an official [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=63.5s)]
*  statement of how they plan to either strike Iran or Hezbollah on a larger scale if they [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=67.9s)]
*  choose to enter this conflict even further. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=72.98s)]
*  And the US has to be prepared to strike because it's looking more and more like a full-scale [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=74.9s)]
*  Israeli war. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=78.62s)]
*  And we need to support the Israelis here and let them do what they have to do. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=79.62s)]
*  We need to give them the opportunity to defeat Hamas once and for all. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=83.46000000000001s)]
*  Specifically when they've gone into Gaza, all this international support fades. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=87.58s)]
*  There's this demand for ceasefires. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=91.62s)]
*  And eventually they get this worldwide pressure that they're using too much disproportionate [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=93.7s)]
*  force there and they're told to pull back. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=97.98s)]
*  But we can't let that happen here. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=99.53999999999999s)]
*  This is exactly why we got into this situation. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=101.02s)]
*  They need, Hamas built strength and they were able to carry out these disgusting attacks [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=104.38s)]
*  because they were not held at bay. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=108.98s)]
*  You just said that the US needs to be prepared to strike. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=111.8s)]
*  That would mean direct US military involvement. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=114.46s)]
*  If the US gets involved, then what about Iran? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=117.02s)]
*  Would then Iran get involved? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=119.94s)]
*  And then where does that leave us, Brett? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=121.3s)]
*  Well, I think it's very clear that Iran was involved in this. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=123.34s)]
*  They are denying it. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=128.74s)]
*  But the scale and sophistication of Hamas' movement into Israel could not have occurred [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=130.06s)]
*  without their help. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=133.98s)]
*  You know, they're a key backer of Hamas as well as Hezbollah. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=134.98s)]
*  They've supplied both groups with weapons, intelligence, financial support, military [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=137.14s)]
*  equipment. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=141.26s)]
*  They've been deeply connected to Hamas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=142.26s)]
*  They've paid them to the tune of some $100 million a year, according to the US State [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=144.34s)]
*  Department. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=148.34s)]
*  So they're receiving all this funding in weapons. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=149.34s)]
*  And I think we need to support conducting offensive operations against Iran behind the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=151.62s)]
*  scenes because they're allowing this to occur. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=157.38s)]
*  When Trump killed Soleimani, Iran was very quiet for some time. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=159.7s)]
*  This is a region that understands strength. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=163.22s)]
*  Iran understands strength, not when you give them $6 billion US to help them conduct attacks [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=165.82s)]
*  just like this in support groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=171.46s)]
*  Velikovic, as always, thank you, sir. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=174.18s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=175.74s)]
*  Thank you, Brad. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bz7V1mZhycA&t=176.74s)]
