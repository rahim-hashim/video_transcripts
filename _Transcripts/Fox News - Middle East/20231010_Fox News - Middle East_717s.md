# Hamas executed a mission funded by Iran, Pompeo says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs)
*  And joining us now is the 70th Secretary of State, Fox News contributor Mike Pompeo is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=0.0s)]
*  with us. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=5.12s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, the way I see it is Prime Minister Netanyahu has no option here, no choice here. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=6.12s)]
*  This is the worst attack ever on Israeli soil. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=12.92s)]
*  The only thing that I might be a little surprised at, I mean, the Israelis' intelligence is [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=17.76s)]
*  known as the world's gold standard. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=22.72s)]
*  Something certainly went wrong here. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=25.6s)]
*  I'm not sure what. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=27.16s)]
*  But it probably is not the time to talk about it. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=28.2s)]
*  Let's get your overall view on what we're seeing. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=30.52s)]
*  By the way, we're also seeing that there have been, you know, minutes apart, we see [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  Israel is firing into Gaza as the show is going on right now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=38.4s)]
*  Well, Sean, thanks for having me on. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  This is grotesque. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=46.96s)]
*  It is barbaric. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=47.96s)]
*  And it requires winning. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=49.22s)]
*  And Prime Minister Netanyahu gets that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=50.56s)]
*  And I am just hoping that this administration doesn't slow him down. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=52.620000000000005s)]
*  These are going to be long weeks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=55.56s)]
*  There are going to be some pictures that come out of Gaza that are going to be tragic. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  But make no mistake about it, Prime Minister Netanyahu has the duty to defend his own people [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=60.8s)]
*  in the same way that the United States has that has that duty. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=64.8s)]
*  We now have Americans held hostage. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=67.88s)]
*  And Hamas, puppet of Iran, is threatening to kill them. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=70.16s)]
*  They've already killed 11 Americans. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=74.0s)]
*  They're threatening to kill Americans live on video and broadcast the audio as well. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=75.44s)]
*  And President Biden hasn't told the Iranians, he hasn't told the world what America's response [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=79.7s)]
*  to that will be. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=84.16s)]
*  I remember, Sean, so well, when the Iranians threatened to kill Americans on our watch, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=85.44s)]
*  when they were launching artillery into the embassy, American embassy in Baghdad, Iraq, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=89.76s)]
*  we made clear we would hold not the knuckleheads on the ground in Iraq, but we would hold the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=93.7s)]
*  Iranian regime responsible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=97.8s)]
*  When we did that, we didn't create World War Three, as they said we might when we got [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=99.92s)]
*  out of the JCPOA, when we moved the embassy, they said we'd create World War Three. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=104.6s)]
*  No, what has created war here is American appeasement, American weakness. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=108.24000000000001s)]
*  And if we don't stand with Israel, if we don't give them the tools that they need to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=113.42s)]
*  prosecute this to the end, until Hamas is wiped out and the Iranian regime understands [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=116.62s)]
*  that the Israelis mean business and they have American support, then we will risk even more [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=121.02s)]
*  American lives. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=125.2s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, let me go over. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=126.2s)]
*  Maybe you can explain this to me. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=129.66s)]
*  The first Iranian deal was Barack Obama and Joe Biden. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=130.82s)]
*  And for the life of me, I never quite understood that deal that would allow them to continue [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=135.7s)]
*  their nuclear program and ratchet it up, as a matter of fact, every year after every [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=139.64s)]
*  year. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=144.23999999999998s)]
*  They didn't have any, as part of that deal, no U.S. inspectors, billions of dollars going [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=145.6s)]
*  to Iranian mullahs. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=150.64s)]
*  They didn't have anywhere, anyplace, any time inspections. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=152.16s)]
*  I don't trust the mullahs of Iran as far as I can throw them. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=156.04s)]
*  OK, Donald Trump becomes president. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=159.92s)]
*  That policy is stopped, thankfully. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=162.11999999999998s)]
*  And here we are back with the $6 billion in ransom payments for five Americans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=165.85999999999999s)]
*  Now, they can argue all they want that so far not a penny of that $6 billion has gone [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=170.66s)]
*  to Iran, but the money has already been moved into Qatar, where we know it's going to end [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=176.83999999999997s)]
*  up in the Iranians' hands. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=182.98s)]
*  And whether they say it's for humanitarian purposes or not, because the president of [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=184.67999999999998s)]
*  Iran has already said, you're not going to tell us how to spend the money, they then—that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=188.39999999999998s)]
*  they would otherwise be spending on their own infrastructure, humanitarian aid, etc., [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=194.26s)]
*  for more terrorist attacks. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=201.73999999999998s)]
*  They are the number one state-sponsored terror. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  Tell me where this mindset comes from, that you are going to do business and pay ransom [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=205.54s)]
*  to terrorists. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=211.38s)]
*  I have a hard time understanding it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=212.38s)]
*  Sean, it's completely unexplainable. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=214.85999999999999s)]
*  It is completely illogical. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=217.7s)]
*  It can only be that as part of the blame America first mantra that we're sort of the problem [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=219.94s)]
*  in the world. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=223.94s)]
*  You saw this on Harvard's campus today. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=224.94s)]
*  Just so indecent, so grotesque to see Americans supporting Hamas that's carting kids into [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=226.85999999999999s)]
*  the Gaza Strip to kill them on live TV. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=232.46s)]
*  The fact that the $6 billion hasn't been spent yet, well, great. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=236.26s)]
*  Make clear it's not going to be. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=239.38s)]
*  Pull it back. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=240.38s)]
*  And, Sean, you know this, too. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=241.38s)]
*  We had the strictest sanctions ever imposed on the Iranian regime. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=243.2s)]
*  It worked. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=246.14s)]
*  We put them in the box. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=247.14s)]
*  We isolated them. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=248.14s)]
*  It built out the Abraham Accords and pieced throughout the Middle East. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=249.14s)]
*  $30 billion of Iranian wealth as a direct result of the Biden administration just refusing [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=253.18s)]
*  to enforce the sanctions that are required to enforce. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=258.3s)]
*  No, it was Iran that fueled this. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=260.82s)]
*  It is Iran that is the problem. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=263.5s)]
*  Hamas executed a mission that was funded, trained and directed by the Iranians. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=265.38s)]
*  I'm confident we will find that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=269.74s)]
*  And I'm worried. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=271.58s)]
*  I'm worried because they're going to do the same thing in the North. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=272.58s)]
*  The Iranians are prepared to fight to the last Hezbollah life or the last Hamas life. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=275.5s)]
*  It is going to have to be Iran that gets costs imposed on it, or this will continue. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=281.38s)]
*  How would you impose those costs? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=287.1s)]
*  Because I agree with you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=288.94s)]
*  Ultimately, all the proxy wars that have been fought in the region, they all seem to have [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=290.34s)]
*  their origins of monies and support coming from Iran. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=296.06s)]
*  We now even have direct reports that the Iranian Revolutionary Guard gave the OK, offered the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=299.65999999999997s)]
*  weapons, gave the financial support. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=305.5s)]
*  So what price does Iran pay in all of this, and how do they pay it? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=307.94s)]
*  So the first step is to make sure Israel secures its own space. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=314.38s)]
*  It's got to go take down Hamas. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=317.17999999999995s)]
*  Every last person who's connected to this has got to be wiped off. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=318.9s)]
*  Second, the United States should demand that not only the United States, but every other [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=322.78s)]
*  country stop providing any money to Iran. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=327.58s)]
*  They're still funding the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=330.5s)]
*  They're still underwriting all kinds of programs that go to these terrorists. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=333.29999999999995s)]
*  We've got to stop all of that funding. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=337.3s)]
*  It could be done tomorrow. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=338.42s)]
*  President Biden just has to say so. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=339.42s)]
*  And then we need to make sure that we deny Iranians the chance to come to school in the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=341.58s)]
*  United States. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=344.9s)]
*  The list is long. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=345.9s)]
*  We have done it, Sean. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=346.9s)]
*  We know precisely how to execute this. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=347.9s)]
*  We don't have to imagine how you build out peace and stability in the Middle East because [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=349.06s)]
*  we had done it for four years. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=353.46s)]
*  The Biden administration just came in, ripped it up, turned it upside down. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=355.09999999999997s)]
*  And the deaths that happened today are the responsibility of Hamas. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=358.06s)]
*  They were caused by Iran. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=361.78s)]
*  But the conditions were set by American weakness in Afghanistan, by allowing Vladimir Putin [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=363.34s)]
*  to think that a small invasion might be OK, and then ultimately not to convince the Iranians [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=368.58s)]
*  that we would have Israel's back. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=373.9s)]
*  When your first instinct is to say, can't we all just get along and the Israelis need [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=375.46s)]
*  to stand down, and then the secretary of state sends out a tweet that also had to be taken [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=380.94s)]
*  down because he demanded a ceasefire, those are the things the Iranians observe. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=385.05999999999995s)]
*  They know that America is not serious. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=388.58s)]
*  And I pray that President Biden understands what is at risk. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=390.62s)]
*  It is Israel and America's place in the world, and we have to get this right. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=394.02s)]
*  Well, you're talking about specifically, you know, we urge all sides to refrain from [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=397.62s)]
*  violence and retaliatory attacks. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=402.18s)]
*  You know, if you break it down, you know, and look at the population of Israel versus [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=405.42s)]
*  the population of the United States, this attack would be the equivalent of, in one [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=410.7s)]
*  day, killing over 35,000 Americans. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=415.7s)]
*  Would that be their position, to stand down and not have a retaliatory strike against [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=419.52s)]
*  the people that would kill 35,000 Americans? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=425.15999999999997s)]
*  That's my first question. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=428.79999999999995s)]
*  And then secondly, what part is Saudi Arabia playing here? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=429.79999999999995s)]
*  Because they seem to condemn Israel in this, and I thought that Israel and the Saudis were [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=433.47999999999996s)]
*  on the verge of making a deal together. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=437.96s)]
*  So two thoughts. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=442.0s)]
*  One, no, we should definitely not be telling Israel. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=443.0s)]
*  No one should be telling Israel how to conduct its foreign policy. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  I saw a statement from the general secretary of the United Nations today that just was [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=448.36s)]
*  sickening, talking about how we need to make sure that everyone obeys international law. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=454.44s)]
*  Goodness, when you're raping women and dragging them back to the Gulf Strip, that's not international [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=459.4s)]
*  law. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=463.44s)]
*  Second, you know, with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia, I hope that what will happen is that [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=464.44s)]
*  they will push forward, is that the kingdom of Saudi Arabia will see, in fact, that Iran [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=468.32s)]
*  is a problem not only for Israel, but for the Emiratis, the Kuwaitis, and for them as [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=472.36s)]
*  well. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=476.88s)]
*  They will understand that the risk of this terror regime from the Islamic Republic of [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=477.88s)]
*  Iran is a risk to them as well. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=481.4s)]
*  And this effort to bring them in to the Abraham Accords to create peace and to recognize Israel [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=484.08s)]
*  will push forward. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=489.08s)]
*  I'm counting on that happening. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=490.08s)]
*  I hope that it will. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=491.28s)]
*  It would make perfect sense for everyone in the region to see that happen. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=492.64s)]
*  Let me ask you, Mr. Secretary, Hamas terrorists, we have evidence and video footage beheading [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=496.32s)]
*  Israeli soldiers. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=504.4s)]
*  We have Hamas executing that teenage girl hostage in front of her parents. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  And then you have people like Congresswoman Tlaib blasting Israel in the wake of this. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=512.12s)]
*  How do you explain that wing of the Democratic Party that seems to be getting louder and [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=518.9200000000001s)]
*  louder and more dominant every single day? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=524.32s)]
*  It's unexplainable, Sean. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=530.0s)]
*  I have no capacity to comprehend how you could watch what has taken place there and have [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=531.04s)]
*  any idea that the right answer to that is to blame the victims of this tragedy. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=536.52s)]
*  We see reminiscences of what happened in the Holocaust. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=542.28s)]
*  We see women and children being dragged off to their death. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=544.92s)]
*  And for a congressman not to call that out, to say, no, that's the problem, and somehow [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=548.48s)]
*  say that those victims are to blame for what's happened is fundamentally indecent. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=552.56s)]
*  And I hope the good people that she represents vote her out immediately. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=557.0799999999999s)]
*  We have to make sure that we all understand that what is happening here is going to go [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=561.4399999999999s)]
*  on for a while. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  This is going to be of duration. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=565.88s)]
*  It is going to require a lot of strength and temerity, and it is going to demand the American [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=567.5999999999999s)]
*  people join together to protect the basic human dignity that America has stood for for [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=571.28s)]
*  250-plus years. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=575.52s)]
*  You know, Mr. Secretary, I shudder to think of a day when the Iranian mullahs, with their [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=576.52s)]
*  radicalism, married to nuclear weapons, and they seem to be desperately trying to get [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=582.4s)]
*  them. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=587.4s)]
*  They have now formed what I call a new axis of evil with China and with Russia, and we [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=588.4s)]
*  can see North Korea becoming a part of it. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=593.92s)]
*  And I shudder to really ask this question, and I think it's the hardest question. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=597.52s)]
*  Does the world have a very limited window here to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=601.68s)]
*  weapons? [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  And does that—do those strikes need to happen sooner than later? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  Sean, I think the window is closing. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=614.6800000000001s)]
*  We absolutely have to get after it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=619.5600000000001s)]
*  We saw this in the Trump administration, and we began this process with actions that we [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=620.98s)]
*  took, including striking against their leader, Qasem Soleimani, General Soleimani, taking [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=625.2s)]
*  seriously the need to push back against Iranian leadership. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=630.2s)]
*  I do worry about these nuclear weapons. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=633.0s)]
*  This administration went back to a policy that gave them money and allowed them to continue [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=635.92s)]
*  to enrich uranium. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=640.6s)]
*  We have to reverse that. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=642.1s)]
*  They should go right back into our model of punishing Iran, imposing restrictions on Iran, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=643.1s)]
*  and denying them the capacity to continue to develop their nuclear weapons program. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=649.2s)]
*  We have the ability to do that, and if we can't stop them through those restrictions, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=653.12s)]
*  then we've got to do the right thing and make sure this regime never gets even remotely [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=656.6s)]
*  close to weaponizing the uranium that they already have. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=659.88s)]
*  Aren't they buried deep within the ground, all throughout the territory of Iran? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=662.88s)]
*  Sean, they are. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=670.64s)]
*  But make no mistake about it. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=671.88s)]
*  If America is serious and Israel is serious and the threat is sufficient, I am very confident [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=673.0s)]
*  that we can make sure that a weapons program is stopped inside of Iran. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=678.3199999999999s)]
*  It will take a seriousness that I have not seen, a resolve I have not seen from the Biden [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=681.56s)]
*  administration. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=685.52s)]
*  Too much Jimmy Carter, not enough Ronald Reagan. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=686.64s)]
*  If we get it right, I'm confident that we can prevent that from happening. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=689.12s)]
*  It would have to be Bibi acting alone, because he'll get no help or support at all from Joe [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=692.8s)]
*  Biden. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=696.96s)]
*  I don't think they're capable of it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=697.96s)]
*  But we need the adults back in charge, that's for sure. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=698.96s)]
*  Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H4QvpDyqXHs&t=702.44s)]
