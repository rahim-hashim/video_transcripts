# Brian Kilmeade: America is scrambling under Biden
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8)
*  I want to start with this. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=0.0s)]
*  With the holiday season now officially underway [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=1.28s)]
*  and 2024 waiting in the wings, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=3.6s)]
*  I'm talking about the election, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=5.44s)]
*  I can't help but think about what's to come for the country. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=7.0s)]
*  And if our military is up for the many challenges [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  this new year will undoubtedly bring. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=12.6s)]
*  You know, we are watching our standing in the world [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=14.88s)]
*  on the world stage become weaker by the day, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=16.96s)]
*  but it's by choice. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=19.32s)]
*  The Biden administration's timid, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=20.8s)]
*  politically correct, risk adverse approach [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=22.52s)]
*  to the so many world challenges [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=24.92s)]
*  are putting all of our lives at risk, in my view. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=27.080000000000002s)]
*  Our military industrial bases have become depleted [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=30.0s)]
*  to the point where our country is now scrambling for weapons [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=32.480000000000004s)]
*  for our allies and even for ourselves. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=35.88s)]
*  So you know we're witnessing a recruiting crisis [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=38.64s)]
*  like never before. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=40.36s)]
*  You got the army, the Navy, the Air Force, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=41.6s)]
*  all expecting to fall short again this year [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=43.28s)]
*  like they have the last couple of years, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  not by a few hundred, but by thousands. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=48.32s)]
*  In fact, the army's having such a hard time recruiting, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=50.88s)]
*  they're asking those soldiers who they booted, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=53.84s)]
*  dismissed for refusing to take the COVID-19 vaccine [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=56.36s)]
*  to come on back. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  You think they will? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=60.76s)]
*  I wouldn't blame them if they didn't. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=61.8s)]
*  The Pentagon failing a financial audit [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=63.519999999999996s)]
*  for the sixth straight year, really. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=65.44s)]
*  Yet instead of figuring out their finances [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=67.56s)]
*  and how to get cash for their weapons, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=69.8s)]
*  it's a for-profit business, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=71.72s)]
*  nothing to be afraid of or to make excuses for. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=73.32s)]
*  The Defense Department is planning to drop [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=76.28s)]
*  nearly $270 million of your funds [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=77.92s)]
*  to further the diversity, equity, and inclusion agenda, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=81.56s)]
*  also known as DEI, for the next two years. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=84.8s)]
*  So it's no coincidence that we are seeing rising threats [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=87.24000000000001s)]
*  from rogue nations across the world [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  and are now reuniting against us. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  Think about it. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=94.56s)]
*  China playing the long game, developing themselves [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=95.4s)]
*  into a scary world power that needs to be confronted. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=97.48s)]
*  Russia, more unpredictable than ever, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  after starting a grinding war with Ukraine. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=102.76s)]
*  They're not going to stop there. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=105.04s)]
*  Iran, fueling terrorists like groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=106.36s)]
*  their many militias, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=109.72s)]
*  and they're targeting our troops on a daily basis, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=110.84s)]
*  all while covertly efforting to become a nuclear power. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=113.72s)]
*  You haven't forgotten about that, have you? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=117.0s)]
*  China remains our number one threat, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  and now they have partners. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=120.52s)]
*  And here's the good news. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=121.8s)]
*  We have more friends and we have more firepower. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=123.03999999999999s)]
*  I think it's time we formulate a plan, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=125.8s)]
*  activate our allies, and show the world [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  we are the world's number one superpower [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=129.92s)]
*  and want to remain there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kur6AYYea8&t=132.12s)]
