# ‘HELL TO PAY’: Trump issues ‘last warning’ to Hamas
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ)
*  Joining me now on the Middle East, the author of the book, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Hunting the Caliphate, retired U.S. Army Major General Dana Pithard. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=3.48s)]
*  General, great to have you with us as always. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=8.0s)]
*  So President Trump has issued what he calls a final warning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=11.24s)]
*  He issued another warning just a couple of weeks ago, I believe it was, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=16.76s)]
*  release all the hostages now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=20.8s)]
*  Hamas clearly ignored that warning because many of the hostages are still being held. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=23.36s)]
*  Do you think this final, final warning will make any difference? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  Well, good morning, Jonathan. Actually, I don't. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=33.92s)]
*  I don't think Hamas is paying much attention to it. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=36.400000000000006s)]
*  There was a warning before, before the inauguration, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=38.92s)]
*  and Hamas didn't pay attention to that. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=42.84s)]
*  So there's no reason to think that Hamas is paying attention to this one either. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=44.84s)]
*  So, General, it seems really difficult when you're dealing with an organization that, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=49.24s)]
*  as you say, is ignoring warnings from the President of the United States, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=55.4s)]
*  is fighting the Prime Minister of Israel and the entire Israeli population. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=61.16s)]
*  And you see, though, when we have the hostages releases as we're looking there on screen, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=68.08s)]
*  you see these marksed fighters lining up. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=74.08s)]
*  Has anything really changed other than the destruction, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=77.4s)]
*  physical destruction of a lot of Gaza? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=82.4s)]
*  There doesn't seem to be much destruction of the ideology of Hamas, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=84.48s)]
*  which is Prime Minister Netanyahu's stated goal. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=90.36s)]
*  No, it's absolutely changed in many ways. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=94.68s)]
*  Hamas, though, has not been destroyed, but Hamas has been defeated. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=97.68s)]
*  So it's time for Hamas to come to the table. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=102.12s)]
*  Hamas has very little leverage. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=104.6s)]
*  They have the hostages, and that's really it. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=108.68s)]
*  And if they're not careful, if Israel is released by the United States [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=111.12s)]
*  to go into Gaza and absolutely destroy Hamas, they can. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=117.08s)]
*  But this is to help the Palestinian people. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=123.12s)]
*  So Hamas needs to come to the table. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=126.2s)]
*  I think the agreements that Israel is looking at is fair for at least Hamas [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=130.12s)]
*  and gives the Palestinian people a chance. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=137.32s)]
*  Hamas said today, I believe it was this morning, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=141.12s)]
*  they released a statement saying that there were, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=144.12s)]
*  I think the words were something like positive signs [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=147.16000000000003s)]
*  regarding phase two of the ceasefire. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=149.8s)]
*  So it appears that the sides are talking, General, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  but if you had to look at the future, would you say that this ends up as a deal [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=156.8s)]
*  where all the hostages get released and there is some sort of negotiated deal here, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=163.32000000000002s)]
*  or as you hinted there, does President Trump say to Israel, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=169.56s)]
*  all the reins are off, do what you need to do? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=175.6s)]
*  Which of those is the more likely scenario? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=178.88s)]
*  Well, I would hope that Hamas comes to the table, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=182.84s)]
*  because if they do not release the hostages, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=187.56s)]
*  they will have no support from the US in the future. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=189.88s)]
*  So they need to release the hostages, including the American, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=194.36s)]
*  and General, before I let you go, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=198.16s)]
*  I want to get your thoughts on Iran as well, if you don't mind. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=200.28s)]
*  President Trump has written this letter to the Iranian leadership [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=204.32s)]
*  trying to get negotiations on their nuclear capabilities restarted. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=209.28s)]
*  The Ayatollah Ali Khamenei responded this morning saying, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=214.48s)]
*  we will not be bullied. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=219.28s)]
*  How does that play out, General? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, Iran, their cards are not really good right now. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=223.44s)]
*  Obviously, much of their air defence capability was destroyed by Israel, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=228.08s)]
*  and they're not in a very good position right now. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=232.52s)]
*  So I think that Iran can come around and sit down, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=234.68s)]
*  but not only the United States, but Saudi Arabia and others in the region, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=240.92000000000002s)]
*  so that their nuclear capability can end, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=244.36s)]
*  and that they do not get a nuclear war. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=247.76s)]
*  And that they do not get a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=251.4s)]
*  That would be... That would make the entire situation in the Middle East much, much worse. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=254.24s)]
*  Yeah, these are difficult times, certainly. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=259.56s)]
*  It'll be interesting to see how all of this plays out. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=262.52s)]
*  Retired US Army Major General Dana Pitar. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=264.8s)]
*  General, it is wonderful to talk to you as always. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=267.68s)]
*  Thank you so much for spending part of your Saturday with us. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1PaagZkHfXQ&t=269.96000000000004s)]
