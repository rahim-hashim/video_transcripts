# Biden admin under fire over Iran-Israel conflict: 'Appeasement and coddling'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 19, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ)
*  We're awaiting President Biden's remarks at a union conference in D.C. We'll be listening [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=0.0s)]
*  when he speaks for any reaction to Israel's overnight retaliatory strikes on Iran. But [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=6.68s)]
*  for now, early this morning, Israel carried out limited strikes near a major Iranian air [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=11.94s)]
*  base and nuclear site. This came days after Iran's unprecedented attack on Israeli soil, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=17.48s)]
*  where sources claim Israel did give the White House a heads up. But the U.S. played no [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=23.6s)]
*  part in the decision to retaliate. Hello, everyone. This is Outnumbered. I'm Kaylee [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=28.659999999999997s)]
*  McEnany here with my cohost, Emily Campagno and Harris Faulkner. Also joining us Fox Business [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=32.9s)]
*  anchor and cohost of the bottom line on Fox Business, Dagan McDowell and Fox News contributor [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=38.099999999999994s)]
*  and professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center, Dr. Mark Siegel. But first, let's [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=42.86s)]
*  go to Jeff Paul. He's live in Tel Aviv with more. Jeff. Yeah, Kaylee, well, life here, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=49.3s)]
*  at least in Tel Aviv, seems very unchanged. You've seen a lot of people out today walking [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=55.14s)]
*  along the beach, exercising, doing their last minute errands, heading into the weekend. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=60.14s)]
*  But prior to today and prior to the strike, there's been a lot of tension in the air, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=64.94s)]
*  as many people throughout the Middle East had a bit of anxiety as they waited to see [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=68.78s)]
*  how Israel would respond to the Iranian attack that happened just six days ago. And what [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  interesting is that through this response, it's really sent a message overall. You know, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=81.83999999999999s)]
*  the Israeli government isn't responding today or putting out any specific comments to what [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=87.16s)]
*  they did, but it shows that Israel can strike within Iran and it can really strike whenever [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  it wants, wherever it wants. Now, it appears, according to our Fox News military source, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=97.28s)]
*  Israel responded with that limited and specific targeted strike in the central region of Isfahan. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=102.6s)]
*  This is significant being that it is so close to the capital of Tehran, but also that it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=109.22s)]
*  near the Natanz nuclear facility. Now, that site was not hit. The strike, though, appears [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=114.82s)]
*  to have been targeting an Iranian air base, but it clearly shows once again that Israel [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=120.38s)]
*  has the capabilities to hit this area. Really, the only comments we've heard from Iran so [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=125.3s)]
*  far were that explosions were heard and that was caused by Iran's air defense systems shooting [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=129.7s)]
*  down three drones. Now, while Iran is seemingly downplaying this strike, retired at General [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=135.38s)]
*  Jack Keane had this to say regarding how Israel's strike could impact Iran. The important thing [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=140.38s)]
*  is there are going to be some sanctions coming forward. Certainly missiles, drones, you mentioned [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=146.58s)]
*  the steel industry, all of that is worthwhile. They're flush with money. And what's that [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=151.78s)]
*  from? Oil, oil, oil, oil. And that should be our focus. Now, really, no comments coming [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=155.82s)]
*  from the Israeli government or the Israeli military. But just a few moments ago, Israeli [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=162.82s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu put out a bit of a cryptic tweet. If you go to his [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=169.42s)]
*  ex account, you can see it yourself, but it's a picture of himself sitting at a desk. There's [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=174.22s)]
*  a bunch of documents. Everything on his desk is blurred out with the message Shabbat shalom. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=178.18s)]
*  Kayleigh. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=183.9s)]
*  Wow, Jeff Paul, thank you. So Iran's foreign minister, one of them yesterday, spoke out [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=184.9s)]
*  about what would happen should Israel strike Iran. Listen to what he said. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=192.26000000000002s)]
*  In case the Israeli regime embarks on adventurism again and takes action against the interests [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=197.26000000000002s)]
*  of Iran, the next response from us will be immediate and at a maximum level. If the Israeli [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  regime commits that grave error once again, our response will be decisive, definitive, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=217.14s)]
*  and regretful for them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=224.14s)]
*  So I wanted to play that because those are harsh words. But then today, Iranian media [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=226.29999999999998s)]
*  seems to be downplaying this attack, Harris. They blamed infiltrators from inside Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=230.38s)]
*  That's an analyst that they had on. And then Reuters has a quote from an Iranian official, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=235.38s)]
*  the foreign source of the incident has not been confirmed. We have not received any external [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=239.38s)]
*  attack, and it goes on. In other words, kind of backing away from that language we heard [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=244.38000000000002s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=248.38000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I trust nothing they say. I don't. I think that when they say, well, you know, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=249.38000000000002s)]
*  this is the end, they claim the end on the weekend as long as, you know, Israel doesn't [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=253.38000000000002s)]
*  make quote unquote another mistake. And now the word from the foreign minister of Iran [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=259.38s)]
*  is adventurism by Israel, like we're all out on a joyride or something. So no, I don't [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=262.38s)]
*  trust anything that they say. I think that, you know, it's potential that the next time [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=267.38s)]
*  they would want to hit Israel, they won't give everybody a heads up because they've [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=272.38s)]
*  already shown that they can hit inside Israel. And yeah, many of those rockets or those [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=275.38s)]
*  missiles and drones failed, so on and so forth. But many of them also had to be shot down. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=280.38s)]
*  So you put a little dirty nuclear fissile material on the end of a warhead, you've got [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=285.38s)]
*  a dirty bomb at that point. And I'm having experts tell me on my show and also just talking [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=291.38s)]
*  with people getting ready for the show, how likely is it that they would do that? Yeah, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=297.38s)]
*  they'll do that. They're dirty actors. They're terrorists. They're going to lie. I don't [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=301.38s)]
*  believe that they think that this was just folly. They're downplaying it because they [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=305.38s)]
*  don't want to have to look bad if they can't hit back with what they know they want to [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=310.38s)]
*  do. We need now more than ever. We do not have the IAEA inspectors on the ground the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=313.38s)]
*  way we did before. We do not have the pressure on Iran the way we did before thanks to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=318.38s)]
*  Biden. We need to know how close they are to a nuclear weapon because threats are threats [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=323.38s)]
*  until their action. And I trust nothing that they say. Yeah, Emily, the Biden administration, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=328.38s)]
*  it's important, I think, to remind viewers what they did in the aftermath of this. They [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=333.38s)]
*  pledged verbally their support for Israel. But then the anonymous administration official, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=337.38s)]
*  you always got to look out for what they have to say. Well, they told Axios this. Biden [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=341.38s)]
*  told Bibi U.S. won't support an Israeli counterattack on Israel. President Biden told [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=345.38s)]
*  Benjamin not Netanyahu this Saturday. You got to win. Take a win. Biden told Netanyahu. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=350.38s)]
*  Perhaps this is a dog whistle to the progressive base he's trying to win back. That's [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=357.38s)]
*  upset about Gaza. But that's not quite unequivocal support when you're signaling this to the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=360.38s)]
*  press. And let's take their official statement, the first official statement after Israel [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=365.38s)]
*  clapped back where within four sentences, Secretary of State Blinken was essentially [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=370.38s)]
*  sort of condemning Israel's attack on the Islamic Republic. Sure, after pledging support, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=375.38s)]
*  but what does pledging your support mean if three sentences later you're condemning the [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=380.38s)]
*  fact that someone is defending themselves? I want to as well add a postscript to the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=384.38s)]
*  messaging I feel like this sends, which is not necessarily demonstrating their capabilities, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=388.38s)]
*  which I don't think anyone questioned. But it's that whole point. It's that we will not [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=392.38s)]
*  let an attack on our soil go unpunished. And when you put that against the landscape, as [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=396.38s)]
*  you said, the Iran's foreign minister who said the military adventurism, Israel has to [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=401.38s)]
*  be compelled to stop it. How? There's a lot that is pushing against Israel right now for [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=406.38s)]
*  their ability to defend themselves. And it seems somewhere along the line that a lot of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=412.38s)]
*  it has been lost in the translation of what exactly provoked this. What provoked this was [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=417.38s)]
*  Hamas's attack on Israel's soil and the butchering of multiple people on a Saturday morning. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=422.38s)]
*  And that somehow seems to be lost in this diplomacy being batted back and forth. So [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=428.38s)]
*  important. You're talking about October 7th, the atrocities, the children who were [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=433.38s)]
*  slaughtered. I could not believe the reporting that came out of the Wall Street Journal [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=437.38s)]
*  yesterday. I had to read it twice. Breaking the U.S. That means Biden is pushing for a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=441.38s)]
*  deal that presses Israel to accept Palestinian statehood in exchange for diplomatic [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=446.38s)]
*  recognition by Saudi Arabia. So in other words, Hamas slaughters children and then the reward [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=451.38s)]
*  is a Palestinian state in the aftermath. Degan. Right. And the Biden administration [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=456.38s)]
*  does nothing to cut off the funding for the reign of terror by Iran and all of its [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=461.38s)]
*  proxies across the Middle East. What General Jack Keane said, oil sanctions should be our [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=469.38s)]
*  focus. And from day one, Biden and company have coddled Iran and allowed the Biden [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=475.38s)]
*  doctrine is appeasement and enrichment of the number one state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=480.38s)]
*  They have sat back and allowed oil exports to soar to a near six year high. China, the [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=486.38s)]
*  biggest buyer of Iranian oil. They are making forty five billion dollars every year. And [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=493.38s)]
*  that is funding essentially a tax on Israel and on American assets. And that is the [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=500.38s)]
*  Biden administration. Two different bills have passed to sanction buyers of oil in [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=505.38s)]
*  China. And Biden has done nothing. They are allowing this. They are subsidizing and [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=512.38s)]
*  bankrolling attacks on the United States and Israel. Yeah. And then Dr. Segal and then [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=518.38s)]
*  Fox News dot com has this headline. Thirteen Democrats vote against resolution condemning [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=523.38s)]
*  Iran. The U.S. is in a state of emergency. The U.S. is in a state of emergency. The [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=528.38s)]
*  Democrats vote against resolution condemning Iran after Israel's strike. Only one Republican, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=533.38s)]
*  but I'm not sure why anyone would vote against that. Yeah. Unbelievably hypocritical. I want [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=538.38s)]
*  to make a couple of historical points here. You know, this is occurring right before [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=542.38s)]
*  Passover. This is when the 10 plagues came. Israel chose the exact time to do this, to [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=546.38s)]
*  hit Iran as a message because October 7th occurred on Sukkos, which is one of our high [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=551.38s)]
*  holidays. And the 73 war occurred during Yom Kippur. They're saying warning and they [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=557.38s)]
*  and they deliberately hit right near that nuclear facility, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=562.38s)]
*  which has three Chinese-sponsored research reactors, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=564.82s)]
*  and they got plenty of uranium in there, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=568.78s)]
*  to Emily's point, in that country, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o4_wzedqrNQ&t=570.7s)]
