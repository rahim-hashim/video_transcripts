# 'FOOLISH': Iran criticized for continuing attacks against Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU)
*  Here with me now, Florida Congressman in Combat Vat, Corey Mills. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=0.0s)]
*  He's also a member of the House Armed Services and Foreign Affairs Committees. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  Congressman, President Trump gave Iran, as I said, another chance to negotiate on this [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=7.76s)]
*  nuclear deal and told CNN that they should now come to the table, make a deal before [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=13.6s)]
*  it's too late. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=18.44s)]
*  Iran has said no. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=19.44s)]
*  They pulled out of those, I guess, Sunday or Monday talks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=20.84s)]
*  Where do you think stand tonight? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=24.04s)]
*  Well, look, the president's tried to offer the olive branch multiple times to get Iran [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=26.84s)]
*  to the table, to look at a peaceful resolution and to ensure that this regime, the Iranian [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  regime, does not have nuclear weapon enrichment capabilities. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=36.28s)]
*  You know, they have time and time again shown that that's exactly what they want to do, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=39.24s)]
*  is enrich the nuclear capabilities and strike those that are in the region, cause destabilization [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=43.16s)]
*  and continue to try and utilize their proxy militias against the West. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=47.92s)]
*  And so the president's done all he could. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=51.36s)]
*  Steve Wittkopf was willing to go into the region. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=53.56s)]
*  I believe he still will. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=55.52s)]
*  But this is really on Iran's aggression. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  How stupid would it be for Iran to hit U.S. military installations in the region? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=61.28s)]
*  And what would perhaps prompt them to do so? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=68.64s)]
*  Look, it's foolish that they're even continuing to try and take the retaliatory attacks that [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=73.16s)]
*  they are against Israel. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=78.08s)]
*  The president and the very first administration made it very clear to Iran that if you strike [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=79.36s)]
*  and kill a single American, you will see devastation like you had never seen before. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=83.16s)]
*  I think that with, you know, the difference between what Israel's trying to do is Israel's [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=87.32s)]
*  really targeting strategic leadership, you know, that being Hossein Salami, the head [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=91.44s)]
*  of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or Fahedun Abassi, who was actually the head [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=95.8s)]
*  of the nuclear program, or even Ali Hajizadeh, who is actually the head of the missile defense [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=100.92s)]
*  programs. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  You're seeing that they're strategically taking people and nuclear capabilities off [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=107.67999999999999s)]
*  the table. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=111.42s)]
*  What Iran is doing, however, is targeting civilians. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=112.42s)]
*  These are very different things, and I think that they're going to see where this could [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=115.18s)]
*  lead to a very quick regime change if they don't start straightening up. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=118.26s)]
*  All right, Congressman, thank you very much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp8dasogooU&t=122.46000000000001s)]
