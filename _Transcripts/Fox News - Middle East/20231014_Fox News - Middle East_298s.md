# Hostage rescue missions in Gaza will be ‘extremely difficult’: Retired Navy SEAL Officer
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4)
*  Israeli Defense Forces preparing for a massive ground invasion in the intensifying war against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=0.0s)]
*  Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=5.88s)]
*  Our next guest warns when it comes to collateral damage, Hamas doesn't care. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=6.88s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about fighting the war against terror firsthand. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=11.8s)]
*  Former Navy SEAL Team 3 Commander Jaco Willink joins us now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=15.48s)]
*  Jaco, thanks for being here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=19.84s)]
*  How do you fight against an enemy that doesn't care? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=20.96s)]
*  Well, you look at what Hamas' objectives were in this attack. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=26.439999999999998s)]
*  They're not looking to further the two-state solution. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=30.64s)]
*  No, all they want is just chaos and mayhem and death and hatred. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=34.519999999999996s)]
*  And I think they've achieved that goal, and it's going to be a rough fight. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  Jaco, what are the chances that we can get, or we or the Israeli hostage, you know, military [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  that are trying to rescue these hostages? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=52.4s)]
*  What are the chances that they can actually get them in the middle of a situation like this? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=54.44s)]
*  This is a really tough scenario with these hostages. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=61.28s)]
*  It is going to take the actual forces moving into Gaza and getting some control so they [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=63.96s)]
*  can gather some intelligence and make those attempts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=69.8s)]
*  But it is going to be extremely difficult. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=72.84s)]
*  So a practical question, Jaco. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=76.24s)]
*  You got a situation where hostages are used as human shields. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=79.56s)]
*  They're in rubble and an urban environment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=83.04s)]
*  And Pete, you brought this up earlier, but I guess have to assume the enemy is not wearing [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=86.84s)]
*  marked clothing. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=90.92s)]
*  They're not in uniform. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=91.92s)]
*  And the battle lines are drawn in every direction. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=95.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no front. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=98.84s)]
*  I mean, how do you pick out the enemy and achieve an objective? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=100.64000000000001s)]
*  I think the advantage that Israel has here that they need to take advantage of is they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=106.48s)]
*  have time and they need to do this in a very slow, methodical way, move through the city [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  very slowly. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=117.2s)]
*  There's going to be all kinds of dangers there, as you pointed out, booby traps, IEDs, snipers. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=118.2s)]
*  It's going to be a real problem moving through there. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  So I think they need to move very slowly as they push into the city and try and do their [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=126.2s)]
*  best to keep themselves safe and keep the civilians that are there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=132.52s)]
*  The Palestinian civilians, these are like, they've been abandoned. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=137.4s)]
*  Hamas doesn't care about them at all. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=142.4s)]
*  And it's a real problem that it seems like the world thinks Hamas is in support of the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=145.12s)]
*  Palestinian people. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=150.52s)]
*  They're not. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=151.52s)]
*  They don't care about the Palestinian people at all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=152.52s)]
*  The Israelis care more about the Palestinian people than Hamas does. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=155.4s)]
*  And so Israel needs to move very slowly, very methodically through this area. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=159.36s)]
*  And it's going to be a very tough fight. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=165.88s)]
*  Jaco, how much do tunnels complicate this? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=167.48s)]
*  I mean, you're used to fighting urban warfare, but not when there are entire cities or at [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=170.28s)]
*  least neighborhoods underground that you're trying to clear as well. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=176.04s)]
*  The tunnels are going to be a huge problem. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=180.68s)]
*  The tunnels are not vulnerable at all to airstrikes. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=182.54s)]
*  So really the airstrikes that Israel is doing at this point, I think they can kind of stand [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=186.44s)]
*  from the airstrikes and move into the ground offensive because these tunnels that are underground, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=191.29999999999998s)]
*  the airstrikes aren't going to have any impact. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=197.45999999999998s)]
*  They're going to have to go and clear those things. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=199.22s)]
*  It's going to be dangerous work. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=201.26s)]
*  But this is what has to be done after what Hamas did to Israel. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=203.0s)]
*  Do you suspect that they're going to hold off on any major attacks or this imminent [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=208.0s)]
*  ground invasion until more of these civilians are cleared out? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=213.98s)]
*  At this point, it looks like it's going not so rapidly in terms of evacuation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=219.73999999999998s)]
*  And also you have the problem that on the Egypt side, they're saying they're not going [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=226.33999999999997s)]
*  to let anyone through. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I think, like I said, Israel should take their time. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=231.26s)]
*  I don't think they should rush. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=235.44s)]
*  I think the more time they give the civilians to leave, the better. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=237.06s)]
*  That being said, it sounds like Hamas is denying the opportunity for the civilians to leave [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=240.5s)]
*  anyways. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  Like I said, Hamas does not want a solution. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=246.3s)]
*  They don't want peace. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=250.46s)]
*  They don't want prosperity in that region. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=252.06s)]
*  They want death. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=255.26000000000002s)]
*  They want destruction. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=256.3s)]
*  And that's what they're going to push for this whole time. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=257.86s)]
*  Last to Jocko, what do you think about America's involvement? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=260.42s)]
*  I mean, if there's American hostages, is there going to be American operators at some point [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=264.14s)]
*  trying to retrieve American hostages? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  If there's American hostages, there will be Americans going to do their best to save them. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=270.94s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=277.02000000000004s)]
*  He knows what he's talking about. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=278.02000000000004s)]
*  We'll see what that means, where and when. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=279.18s)]
*  It lays before us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=281.78000000000003s)]
*  Jocko Willing, thank you very much for your time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=282.94s)]
*  Thanks, Jocko. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=284.74s)]
*  And everything you've done for our country. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgryEmsSFM4&t=285.74s)]
