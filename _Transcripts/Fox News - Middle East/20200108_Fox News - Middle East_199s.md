# Sen. Lee: Senate Iran briefing was 'lame' and 'inadequate'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg)
*  Was it all of them? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=0.0s)]
*  Was it a specific cabinet member or agency director? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=3.0s)]
*  Before I come on on that publicly, I'd really like to have a conversation with the president [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=6.5s)]
*  so I can make him aware of what we were told and by whom. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=9.42s)]
*  But I will say that the messages we received didn't get any pushback internally from the [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=13.02s)]
*  briefers. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=16.98s)]
*  What we were told over and over again was, look, this action was necessary, this was [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=18.02s)]
*  a bad guy. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=23.28s)]
*  We had to do it and we can't have division, we can't have dissension within our ranks, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=24.56s)]
*  within our government or else it sends the wrong signal to the Iranians. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  I think that's completely wrong. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=36.28s)]
*  They were asked repeatedly, what, if anything, would trigger the need for the administration [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=39.379999999999995s)]
*  to come back to Congress for a declaration of war or an authorization for the use of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=46.94s)]
*  military force. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=51.099999999999994s)]
*  At one point, I believe one of the briefers said something along the lines of, I'm sure [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=52.2s)]
*  we could think of something. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=55.32s)]
*  But they struggled to identify anything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=57.88s)]
*  They were asked specifically, what about if you concluded, well, it's not my point to [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=60.64s)]
*  get into that here, I don't want to accidentally say anything classified. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=67.53999999999999s)]
*  My point is, they were asked a number of hypotheticals about situations in which they might have [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=71.22s)]
*  to appropriately come and ask for authorization for Congress. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=77.24s)]
*  Not once did they say yes, we need to do it in that circumstance. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=82.78s)]
*  At one point, one of the briefers said something like, don't worry, we'll consult you. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=87.53999999999999s)]
*  Well, with history as our guide, consultation isn't necessarily the same thing as authorization [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=94.46s)]
*  for the use of military force. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=102.19999999999999s)]
*  A declaration of war or an AUMF is what the Constitution requires, and drive-by notification [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=104.24s)]
*  or after the fact, lame briefings like the one we just received aren't adequate. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=110.6s)]
*  Look, I'm still agnostic as to that, Manu. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=120.03999999999999s)]
*  I still haven't had the questions answered that I came into that briefing expecting to [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=124.56s)]
*  ask. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=130.12s)]
*  They left after 75 minutes. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=131.12s)]
*  Now, I understand these are busy people, they've got a lot of demands on their time. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=132.84s)]
*  They're appearing before a coordinate branch of government, a coordinate branch of government [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=138.04s)]
*  responsible for their funding, for their confirmation, for any approval of any military action they [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=141.76s)]
*  might undertake. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=148.6s)]
*  They had to leave after 75 minutes while they're in the process of telling us that we need [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=149.6s)]
*  to be good little boys and girls and run along and not debate this in public. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=155.5s)]
*  I find that absolutely insane. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=160.56s)]
*  I think it's unacceptable. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=164.36s)]
*  And so I don't know what they had in mind. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=166.4s)]
*  I went in there hoping to get more specifics as far as the factual, legal, moral justification [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=168.92000000000002s)]
*  for what they did. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=174.88s)]
*  I'm still undecided on that issue, in part because we never got to the details. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=177.12s)]
*  Every time we got close, they'd say, well, we can't discuss that here because it's really [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=181.12s)]
*  sensitive. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=186.76s)]
*  We're in a skiff. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=187.76s)]
*  We're in a secure underground bunker where all electronic devices have to be checked [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=189.16s)]
*  at the door and they still refuse to tell us. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=195.04s)]
*  I find that really upsetting. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-SmpP-BhDg&t=197.51999999999998s)]
