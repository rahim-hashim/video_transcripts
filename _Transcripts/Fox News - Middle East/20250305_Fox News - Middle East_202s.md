# Trump reveals arrest of terrorist responsible for American deaths in Afghan withdrawal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g)
*  America is once again standing strong against the forces of radical Islamic terrorism. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=0.0s)]
*  Three and a half years ago ISIS terrorists killed 13 American service members and countless [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=6.92s)]
*  others in the Abbey Gate bombing during the disastrous and incompetent withdrawal from [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=12.46s)]
*  Afghanistan. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=18.46s)]
*  Not that they were withdrawing, it was the way they withdrew. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=20.38s)]
*  Perhaps the most embarrassing moment in the history of our country. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=24.94s)]
*  I am pleased to announce that we have just apprehended the top terrorist responsible [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=29.04s)]
*  for that atrocity and he is right now on his way here to face the swift sword of American [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=35.06s)]
*  justice. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=41.78s)]
*  And I want to thank especially the government of Pakistan for helping arrest this monster. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=59.04s)]
*  This was a very momentous day for those 13 families who I actually got to know very well, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=72.62s)]
*  most of them, whose children were murdered and the many people that were so badly, over [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=78.14s)]
*  42 people so badly injured on that fateful day in Afghanistan. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=85.06s)]
*  What a horrible day. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=89.68s)]
*  Such incompetence was shown that when Putin saw what happened, I guess he said, wow, maybe [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=92.48s)]
*  this is my chance. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=99.80000000000001s)]
*  That's how bad it was. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  Should have never happened. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=103.02000000000001s)]
*  Grossly incompetent people. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=104.2s)]
*  I spoke to many of the parents and loved ones and they're all in our hearts tonight. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=106.86s)]
*  I spoke to them on the phone. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=114.58s)]
*  We had a big call. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=116.22s)]
*  Every one of them called and everybody was on the line and they did nothing but cry with [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  happiness. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=124.98s)]
*  They were very happy, as happy as you can be under those circumstances. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=125.98s)]
*  Child, brother, sister, son, daughter was killed for no reason whatsoever. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=130.8s)]
*  In the Middle East, we're bringing back our hostages from Gaza. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=140.60000000000002s)]
*  In my first term, we achieved one of the most groundbreaking peace agreements in generations, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=145.34s)]
*  the Abraham Accords. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=150.96s)]
*  And now we're going to build on that foundation to create a more peaceful and prosperous future [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=159.86s)]
*  for the entire region. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=176.4s)]
*  A lot of things are happening in the Middle East. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  People have been talking about that so much lately with everything going on with Ukraine [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=179.62s)]
*  and Russia. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=184.4s)]
*  But a lot of things are happening in the Middle East. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=185.4s)]
*  Left neighborhood, actually. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuRJWUVUa8g&t=188.68s)]
