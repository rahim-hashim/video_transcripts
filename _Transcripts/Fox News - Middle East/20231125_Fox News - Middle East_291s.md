# 'There has never been a political solution to this': Brig. Gen. Don Bolduc
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc)
*  the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=0.0s)]
*  Palestinian prisoners freed [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=7.96s)]
*  any moment now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=9.08s)]
*  This is expected to hold up [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=10.14s)]
*  their end of the bargain and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=12.1s)]
*  release a second wave of [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=13.22s)]
*  Israeli hostages in possibly [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=14.34s)]
*  less than 30 minutes. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=16.82s)]
*  So stay tuned. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=18.06s)]
*  Retired brigadier general [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=19.98s)]
*  Don bold up joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=20.98s)]
*  We've talked all morning, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=23.1s)]
*  general, about the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=24.14s)]
*  humanitarian aspect of these [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=25.86s)]
*  hostage releases. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=27.94s)]
*  But from a military [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=28.96s)]
*  perspective, what are you [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=29.96s)]
*  on guard for today? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=30.96s)]
*  Well, you know, I mean, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=32.96s)]
*  obviously I think the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=34.96s)]
*  Israelis have taken the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=36.96s)]
*  proper precautions with how [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=38.96s)]
*  they're handling the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=40.96s)]
*  hostage exchange with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=42.96s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=44.96s)]
*  That doesn't worry me as [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=45.96s)]
*  much as the implications of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=46.96s)]
*  the temporary ceasefire and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=49.96s)]
*  how unbalanced that [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=50.96s)]
*  temporary ceasefire is. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=52.96s)]
*  You know, Israel has two [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=53.96s)]
*  goals, one to destroy [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=55.96s)]
*  Hamas and the other to [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=56.96s)]
*  gain the release of the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=57.980000000000004s)]
*  hostages. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=58.980000000000004s)]
*  And both are incompatible [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=59.980000000000004s)]
*  with each other when it [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=60.980000000000004s)]
*  comes to securing decisive [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=61.980000000000004s)]
*  military operations on the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=63.980000000000004s)]
*  ground. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=64.98s)]
*  I mean, I lived this for [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=65.98s)]
*  10 tours in Afghanistan, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=66.98s)]
*  and I saw how it emboldened [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=68.98s)]
*  the enemy, how it helped [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=70.98s)]
*  our enemy. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=71.98s)]
*  Humanitarian supplies will [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=72.98s)]
*  end up in the hands of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=75.98s)]
*  Hamas and be taken from [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=76.98s)]
*  the Palestinian civilians. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=77.98s)]
*  That's just the reality of [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=78.98s)]
*  it. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=79.98s)]
*  We saw it time and time [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=80.98s)]
*  again. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=81.98s)]
*  And this is just the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=82.98s)]
*  biggest challenge for [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=83.98s)]
*  us. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=84.98s)]
*  We saw it time and time [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=86.0s)]
*  again. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=87.0s)]
*  And this is just the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=88.0s)]
*  beginning of the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=89.0s)]
*  international community [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=90.0s)]
*  tying one hand behind the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=92.0s)]
*  Israeli military's back to [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=94.0s)]
*  try and accomplish their [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=96.0s)]
*  mission of destroying [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=97.0s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=98.0s)]
*  There's never been a [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=99.0s)]
*  political solution to [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=100.0s)]
*  this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=101.0s)]
*  The military solution is a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=102.0s)]
*  solution that, of course, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=104.0s)]
*  is always something that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=105.0s)]
*  people kind of back away [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=108.0s)]
*  from. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=112.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=113.0s)]
*  Hamas needs to be destroyed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=114.02s)]
*  This ceasefire favors Hamas, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=117.02s)]
*  will always favor Hamas, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=119.02s)]
*  and the international [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=121.02s)]
*  community, the Biden [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=122.02s)]
*  administration, the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=123.02s)]
*  international media, are [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=124.02s)]
*  now using this ceasefire [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=125.02s)]
*  and developing a narrative [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=128.02s)]
*  that paints Israel as the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=129.02s)]
*  ones at fault here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=132.02s)]
*  And that couldn't be [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=133.02s)]
*  further from the truth. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=134.02s)]
*  You highlighted, I think, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=135.02s)]
*  an internal struggle that [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=136.02s)]
*  so many of us are having [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=137.02s)]
*  because this is a holiday [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=138.02s)]
*  weekend, right? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=139.02s)]
*  And we've just seen these [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=140.02s)]
*  beautiful images of a [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=141.02s)]
*  little boy running to be [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=142.02s)]
*  with his family. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=143.04000000000002s)]
*  But how do you reconcile [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  that? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  How does the viewer [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  watching at home right [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=147.04000000000002s)]
*  now reconcile that with [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=148.04000000000002s)]
*  the operational reality [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  of what this pause means [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  for the war, for the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  people that are going [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=152.04000000000002s)]
*  to be doing the fighting [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  in this war? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=154.04000000000002s)]
*  Well, this is how I [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=155.04000000000002s)]
*  reconciled it when babies [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  died in my arms, when I [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=157.04000000000002s)]
*  went into refugee camps [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=158.04000000000002s)]
*  and saw babies covered [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  with flies, when I saw [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=160.04000000000002s)]
*  what the Taliban and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=161.04000000000002s)]
*  Al-Qaeda and ISIS did [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  to the children of [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  Hamas, and I think [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=165.04000000000002s)]
*  that's what I [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  I understand that this [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=167.06s)]
*  tugs at the heartstrings [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=168.06s)]
*  of everybody, and this [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=169.06s)]
*  is something that we [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=170.06s)]
*  don't want to see. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=171.06s)]
*  But those of us that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=172.06s)]
*  have to fight it, those [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=173.06s)]
*  of us that have seen [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=174.06s)]
*  it, only want to be [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=175.06s)]
*  able to fight it and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=176.06s)]
*  have the best opportunity [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=177.06s)]
*  to win. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=agro2-zQOKc&t=178.06s)]
