# I trust Qatar like a 'rest stop bathroom': Sen. Kennedy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ)
*  Senator John Kennedy, Louisiana, now joins Dana and me here in New York from the Hill, sir. Good morning to you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Who Iran, Ukraine, Middle East, Gaza, Hamas. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=7.2s)]
*  Let's start with Iran because before America woke up earlier today, this is what the president said about that ongoing matter. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=11.96s)]
*  I want to make a deal with Iran. I want to do something if it's possible. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=19.28s)]
*  But for that to happen it must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars and [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=23.12s)]
*  permanently and verifiably cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons. They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=29.12s)]
*  Okay, so that statement twice now in two days. In a moment ago, he said the Iran situation will work out. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=34.72s)]
*  Your reflections on what we're watching now, Senator. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=41.08s)]
*  Well first quickly, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=44.56s)]
*  Qatar. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=46.8s)]
*  I trust Qatar like I [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=49.8s)]
*  like I trust a rest stop bathroom. If they want to be friendly, I want to be friendly back, but [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=51.8s)]
*  with those guys, you know, trust in God, but tie up your camel. Now in terms of Iran, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=59.04s)]
*  what you do is what you believe and everything else is just cottage cheese. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=65.84s)]
*  That's true in life and in foreign policy. You can't just talk tough. You got to be tough. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=70.56s)]
*  Trump's been president only well over a hundred days. So [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=78.36s)]
*  the Iranians have to judge us and are judging us in part on the past four years. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=82.6s)]
*  President Biden talked tough, but look at what he did. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=87.16s)]
*  You know, he he didn't enforce the sanctions on Iran. We had a shambolic [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=90.84s)]
*  withdrawal from from from Afghanistan. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=97.16s)]
*  He told Putin he shouldn't go into Ukraine, but if he did, it's okay if it's a minor excursion. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=101.24s)]
*  President Biden, I mean he talked tough, but he never delivered. He [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=107.8s)]
*  he kind of reminds me of my hometown Baton Rouge newspaper. They talk tough, but they can't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=112.52s)]
*  quite pull it off when they show up to a party in crocs and knee-high tube socks. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=123.72s)]
*  Trump has got to look the eye totally in the eye and say, look, we can do it the easy way, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=132.2s)]
*  the hard way. Okay. Let's skip the foreplay. You have to get rid of your uranium, all of it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=137.24s)]
*  You can't even have a centella of uranium. You're not going to have a weapon. If you do that, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=145.0s)]
*  we'll remove the sanctions and we'll help you prosper as long as you stop hurting people and [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=150.12s)]
*  give up your bomb. If you don't do that, I'm going to saddle up with Israel and slap you into Pluto. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  And then we'll see what happens. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=162.12s)]
*  Yesterday he did say to Iran, he said, make your move one way or another. Go ahead, Dana. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=163.72s)]
*  Well, I'm just, I'm curious also about how you would feel about verification of Iran saying that [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=169.16s)]
*  they're giving up their nuclear weapons. I mean, that verification is a really big problem. What [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=176.76s)]
*  would satisfy you or the other Republicans in the Senate on that? Well, I would like to see the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=181.48s)]
*  International Atomic Energy Agency be able to go in, but I'd like to send some American folks in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=187.88000000000002s)]
*  with them. Like I say, you know, trust in God, but tie up your camel. Look, these are not normal [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=194.92000000000002s)]
*  people. Okay. They're just, they're not abnormal like a, like a Karen is abnormal. They're zealous. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=203.4s)]
*  Their religion teaches them to kill other people. They're not, they're shrewd, but they're barking [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=212.36s)]
*  mad and you just can't trust them. And President Obama trusted them and we see how that all turned [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=221.08s)]
*  out. Senator, let me hit you on one more topic while we got you. We talked about Iran. We'll [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=228.12s)]
*  find out tomorrow what happens in Turkey between Russia and Ukraine. You made your feelings quite [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=232.36s)]
*  clear about Hamas. I mean, their leadership lived in Qatar for, I made a lot of money doing it over [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=238.12s)]
*  the years. Okay. And now you've got Syria. You, you had a guy who used to be a member of Al Qaeda. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=243.08s)]
*  You got a guy who leads that country now who used to be in an, an Abu Ghraib in Iraq, Anbar [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=248.6s)]
*  province for I think five years. Now the president wants to lift sanctions on Syria, welcome them [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=255.0s)]
*  into this bigger Middle East. Are you and your colleagues okay with that? Well, I can't speak [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=260.68s)]
*  for my colleagues. The, the, the new leader in Syria has a, I say a checkered past, but he's [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=267.24s)]
*  better than Al-Assad. I think we ought to give him a chance. I think we ought to remove the sanctions. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=277.64s)]
*  I think the president's right, but I think we ought to be ready to double down on those sanctions [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=283.08s)]
*  if, if they, if they're not inclusive and they start persecuting other, other sects in, in Syria. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=290.59999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to go through what we went through in a Syria with Assad, but I do think we ought [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=299.4s)]
*  to give them a chance. Okay. These are big pieces. We'll see how many of them move. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=304.44s)]
*  Thank you, Senator. We appreciate your time this morning. As we had breaking news, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbVBrMmotfQ&t=309.47999999999996s)]
