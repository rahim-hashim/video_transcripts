# US conducts airstrikes in Syria
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk)
*  Sean, we can report, based on senior military sources, that U.S. warplanes have carried [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=0.0s)]
*  out airstrikes tonight inside Syria against Iranian proxy forces. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  We don't know the number of strikes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=13.26s)]
*  We were told earlier today to expect that perhaps F-15s and F-16s would be involved [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=15.780000000000001s)]
*  in the airstrikes, but we don't have confirmation yet about how many warplanes. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=22.14s)]
*  But those strikes have been carried out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=27.5s)]
*  I'm told it is in response to the more than dozen strikes against U.S. bases. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=29.28s)]
*  The message is a clear message designed to Iran and its proxy forces to stop carrying [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=36.0s)]
*  out these drone and rocket attacks against U.S. bases. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=41.92s)]
*  But I'm told that the planes have safely left the area and that the airstrikes are [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=46.660000000000004s)]
*  complete at this time. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=51.28s)]
*  They were targeting multiple locations inside Syria and Iranian proxy forces. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=53.24s)]
*  Sean? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=59.02s)]
*  It's so important, Jennifer. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=60.02s)]
*  Thank you for that breaking news, especially in light of the fact that American forces [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=62.06s)]
*  have been attacked by both Iraq and by Syria. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=65.98s)]
*  We appreciate that news. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVwcczL1Wbk&t=69.06s)]
