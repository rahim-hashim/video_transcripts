# KJP dodges Peter Doocy's question on anti-Israel protests
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc)
*  Does President Biden think the anti-Israel protesters in this country are extremists? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=0.0s)]
*  What I can say is what we've been very clear about this. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=8.0s)]
*  When it comes to anti-Semitism, there is no place. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=11.44s)]
*  We have to make sure that we speak against it very loud and be very clear about that. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=14.46s)]
*  Does President Biden look at these anti-Israel protests on college campuses and think it's [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=21.78s)]
*  nice to see that the country's youth are so involved or does he think the next generation [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=26.64s)]
*  is doomed? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=33.6s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=34.6s)]
*  There's no place for hate in America. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=36.32s)]
*  I'm telling you, there's no place for hate in America and we condemn it. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=39.52s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=44.68s)]
*  Yeah, I think we're doomed. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=45.68s)]
*  Yeah, I'm going to go doomed. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=46.68s)]
*  There you get the White House falling short of calling anti-Israeli protesters extremists. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=47.68s)]
*  It should have been an easy question to answer as they hurl anti-Semitic smears and target [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=53.6s)]
*  Jewish students on college campuses all over America, which we've been detailing over [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=59.18s)]
*  the last couple of weeks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=64.88s)]
*  And just as an example, let's start with Yale. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=67.32000000000001s)]
*  The Yale newspaper had an op-ed that was so simple and then the editor goes in a couple [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=72.76s)]
*  days later and changes the facts. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=81.68s)]
*  Yeah, so this was October 12th. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=83.60000000000001s)]
*  The Yale campus newspaper censored this. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=86.12s)]
*  This is what the op-ed said. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=89.4s)]
*  Is Yalees for Palestine a hate group? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=91.2s)]
*  And they talk about that this is a sophomore who wrote this. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=95.38000000000001s)]
*  And Sahara Tardak. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=99.08000000000001s)]
*  Okay, so she says they censored it and they said it's unsubstantiated claims that Hamas [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=102.08000000000001s)]
*  raped women and beheaded men. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=110.68s)]
*  And then she says, I'm still collecting my thoughts on this newspaper, this egregious [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=113.24s)]
*  collection. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=118.44s)]
*  Right, she was talking about all the horrors of October 7th. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=119.44s)]
*  And then the paper went in and said, they changed it. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=122.24000000000001s)]
*  They said, quote, this column has been edited to remove unsubstantiated claims that Hamas [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=125.64s)]
*  raped women and beheaded men. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=131.46s)]
*  It's not unsubstantiated. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=133.68s)]
*  We know that it happened. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=135.22s)]
*  There's video that it happened. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=137.56s)]
*  We just got the report yesterday. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=139.3s)]
*  I know they're probably too sophisticated to read the New York Post, but it's on the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=141.18s)]
*  cover. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=145.14000000000001s)]
*  That's a woman that was beheaded. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=146.38000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if that should change it if you want to adjust your editor. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=147.38000000000002s)]
*  But this is Yale University. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=150.46s)]
*  You know what they're trying to do? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=151.46s)]
*  The overall sentiment is soften the whole thing. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=152.86s)]
*  Forget about October 7th and talk about the retribution that happened because of October [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=155.3s)]
*  7th. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=159.74s)]
*  There is a concerted effort to dismiss what's happening with Jews, not only in this country, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=160.74s)]
*  but what just happened in the war because of the color of their skin. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=168.06s)]
*  And that's just not right. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=172.98s)]
*  You don't get to tell another minority group because of the color of their skin that something [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=174.48s)]
*  did not happen. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=179.34s)]
*  These are the same people, Steve, that are denying the Holocaust as well. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=180.34s)]
*  I know it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=184.62s)]
*  I know it. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=185.62s)]
*  We are here in New York City. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=186.62s)]
*  In New York City, 100 Columbia University professors signed a letter defending the students [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=187.62s)]
*  who supported Hamas's military action. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=193.84s)]
*  They weren't supporting the Palestinian people per se. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=198.54000000000002s)]
*  They were supporting the military action on October 7th, which as we know beheaded babies [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=202.38000000000002s)]
*  and women and killed all sorts of people. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=208.24s)]
*  Cornell, there were comments to go to the Jewish Center and slit their throats. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=211.02s)]
*  For all the liberals out here that have been waiting to defund something, this is your [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=218.26000000000002s)]
*  chance. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=222.34s)]
*  Defund these campuses. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=223.98000000000002s)]
*  They should not be getting your money. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=225.34s)]
*  They're educating your kids. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=227.06s)]
*  Misinformation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=228.94s)]
*  They're spewing Hamas talking points. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=229.94s)]
*  They're open propagandists for Hamas. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=232.22s)]
*  Do you want to give your money there? [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=235.22s)]
*  I mean, it's sick. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=237.18s)]
*  And a lot of donors are pulling the plug. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=240.06s)]
*  They are, as they should. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=242.98s)]
*  They rally to stop Bud Light, but not to stop this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=245.38s)]
*  It's unreal. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkdPBWrPQgc&t=248.26s)]
