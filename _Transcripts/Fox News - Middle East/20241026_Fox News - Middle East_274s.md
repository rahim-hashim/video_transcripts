# Israel unleashes retaliatory strikes on Iran overnight
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk)
*  Let's bring in Morgan Ortegas. She's former State Department spokesperson to help us understand what happened overnight. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=0.0s)]
*  Morgan, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=5.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=7.2s)]
*  What's going on right now between Israel and Iran? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=7.7s)]
*  While it is described as the largest ever attack on Iran, it's a little bit like two fighters who keep punching each other, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=11.0s)]
*  but saying, okay, let's leave it there before they go into an all-out fight. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=18.5s)]
*  They're trying to seemingly hit each other without it escalating into an all-out war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=22.6s)]
*  How significant, strategically and militarily, was this hit on Iran? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=28.599999999999998s)]
*  Well, first of all, I think that we have been in an all-out war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=36.0s)]
*  We're still assessing what has happened overnight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=38.5s)]
*  I think the key thing to note is that there were not any attacks against Iran, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=41.4s)]
*  and oil infrastructure or the nuclear facility strikes, those are things that people were talking about for the past month, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=45.9s)]
*  were judging if Israel would hit them. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=52.599999999999994s)]
*  I thought all along it made sense to go after a key IRGC, Iranian military targets, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=55.0s)]
*  but if we step back for a second, remember, this was the second time that Iran had attacked Israel [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=61.0s)]
*  with ballistic missiles and drones and other sophisticated projectiles. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=66.6s)]
*  It happened in April. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=70.9s)]
*  Biden then told Netanyahu, whenever the U.S. and Israel together were able to shoot down those projectiles, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=72.9s)]
*  Biden told Netanyahu, basically, take a knee, consider it a win, don't punch back. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=79.0s)]
*  And Israel listened at the time, and they didn't. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=83.6s)]
*  When it happened almost a month ago, it was so flagrant at that point, Israel had to respond. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=86.1s)]
*  A big key difference over almost a month ago, when Iran tried to attack Israel, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=91.6s)]
*  and again, we were able, with the United States and Israel, able to shoot everything down, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=96.6s)]
*  when that happened, Iran's intent was to hit civilian infrastructure within Israel. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  They wanted to harm civilians. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=106.69999999999999s)]
*  The attack, the counterattack that you saw Israel do last night, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=108.6s)]
*  was aimed specifically at Iranian military facilities. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=112.0s)]
*  It was done early Saturday morning in the Middle East. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=115.3s)]
*  This was, there was no intent at all to try and harm any civilians. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=119.19999999999999s)]
*  That's the big difference between what Iran's terror proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah, do, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=123.0s)]
*  where their specific aim is to hurt civilians. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=128.29999999999998s)]
*  Big difference between these two attacks. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=131.1s)]
*  And more going to happen Saturday night local, but it was Friday night here. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=133.29999999999998s)]
*  We all learned about it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=136.0s)]
*  Which means Donald Trump heard about it as well, and at his rally in Michigan, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=137.6s)]
*  he made these comments about Kamala Harris. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=140.79999999999998s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=143.2s)]
*  So, Israel is attacking. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  We got a war going on, and she's out partying. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=149.6s)]
*  At least we're working to make America great again. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=152.4s)]
*  That's what we're doing. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=155.2s)]
*  Kamala. Kamala. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=158.29999999999998s)]
*  He's the worst president in the history of our country. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=161.79999999999998s)]
*  She's the worst vice president in the history of our country. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=165.2s)]
*  And Morgan, it is staggering how little we know about what a Kamala Harris foreign policy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=169.6s)]
*  would actually be. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=175.6s)]
*  I mean, she was a senator, she was a vice president, yet talks almost never about it. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=176.79999999999998s)]
*  Well, we'd have some key insights. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=183.0s)]
*  The person that's her key foreign policy advisor, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=184.79999999999998s)]
*  one of the proponents, authors of the JCPOA, which is the failed Iran nuclear deal. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  So, we can anticipate, at least from the advisors that she puts around her, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=193.0s)]
*  that she'd be very dovish towards Iran. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=196.6s)]
*  It's important to remember that Biden and Harris have been wrong at almost every turn [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=198.8s)]
*  with Israel over the past year. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=203.2s)]
*  They told Israel repeatedly, do not go into Ra'afah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=205.2s)]
*  Where did Israel ultimately rescue hostages in Ra'afah? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=208.8s)]
*  Where did they ultimately kill Samoar in Ra'afah? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=213.0s)]
*  So, Israel, for over a year, have had their hands tied behind their back, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=215.6s)]
*  because the United States, don't forget, just a few weeks ago, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=219.79999999999998s)]
*  we had a massive intelligence leak that probably delayed the strikes that Israel did last night. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=223.2s)]
*  I mean, that is, it's such a bad precedent, not only for our relationship with Israel, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=228.6s)]
*  but for allies around the world. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=233.6s)]
*  It's why I think, not only is there the Israelis, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=235.4s)]
*  the Ukrainians, before their offensive and curse, didn't tell this administration. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=238.2s)]
*  So, you repeatedly see around the world, while the Israelis gave the administration [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=243.0s)]
*  a heads up last night, before the pager and walkie-talkie attacks, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=247.39999999999998s)]
*  and before some of Israel's most significant attacks against Hezbollah, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=251.6s)]
*  they didn't tell this administration. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=255.39999999999998s)]
*  So, key allies feel like they can't coordinate with Biden and Harris, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  because they can't trust them, Pete. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=261.2s)]
*  Morgan Artegas, thank you for getting up early. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=264.0s)]
*  Thank you, Morgan. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=266.2s)]
*  Giving us your point of view. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=266.8s)]
*  Anytime. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=268.59999999999997s)]
*  As this happened really, you know, so late last night. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=269.2s)]
*  So, thank you so much. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=271.59999999999997s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MmeiQMecMCk&t=272.59999999999997s)]
