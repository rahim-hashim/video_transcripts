# US cozying up to Iran has created ‘enormous risk’: Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE)
*  Joining us now, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary, I want to start there. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=0.0s)]
*  You're very familiar with the tensions of this region. And to this point about these ongoing [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  conversations, Politico said this, interventions by Rahim Safavid, which is a top Iranian official, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=10.64s)]
*  and other senior Iranian policymakers will be seen by Iran's long-running regional rival, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=16.48s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, as a threatening signal that Tehran is willing to stir up regional conflict [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=20.8s)]
*  to prevent Riyadh from normalizing ties with Israel as the U.S. wants. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=25.68s)]
*  Do you think that's what this is about? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=29.84s)]
*  Well, Shannon, good morning. This is at its core about historic efforts by Iran to wipe Israel off [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=33.44s)]
*  the face of the earth. Make no mistake about it. These were barbaric attacks. They are continuing. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=40.72s)]
*  Women and children, there's no hostages being held. You know, I was on this very show a few [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  weeks back talking about the fact that when the United States pays a billion dollars per hostage, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=50.56s)]
*  there'll be more hostage-taking. Look what happened yesterday. More hostages taken by [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=54.48s)]
*  the Iranian regime's proxy, Hamas, in Gaza. This is a bad set of policies. When I hit Mr. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=59.04s)]
*  Feiner talk about the fact that that decision to give them $6 billion didn't matter, we can't [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=64.47999999999999s)]
*  forget, too. We gave Palestinians $230 million on nearly day one of the Biden administration. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=69.36s)]
*  No, the responsible party here are the leadership, the terrorists in Gaza Strip, Hamas. They are [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=75.36s)]
*  funded by Iran. And the United States policy to cozy up to Iran has created enormous risk for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=82.16s)]
*  Israel, which we are seeing play out today. And you should know, too, the Gulf states all are [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=88.0s)]
*  watching what Iran is doing here. They can see this was a moment of clarity for the world. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  Do not avert your eyes. I hope the world will continue to watch what's taking place here, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  because this is precisely why we built out a structure which isolated Iran, caused at least [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  four countries to normalize relationships with Israel, and why when the Biden administration [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=107.84s)]
*  disrupted that, there's so much risk for the American people as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=112.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, and to the broader impact, National Review has this headline, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=115.52000000000001s)]
*  The World is About to Change and Likely for the Worst. They say that this presumably [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=118.56s)]
*  scotches years of diplomacy quietly shepherded by both the Trump and Biden administrations. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=123.28s)]
*  Trying to get Saudi Arabia to officially recognize Israel, Iran's self-interest here is thus [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=128.32s)]
*  transparently obvious. But think further afield to places like China, Russia, Ukraine, and America. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=132.56s)]
*  What do you make of the potential for broader impact, as you just sort of touched on? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=139.76s)]
*  Shannon, I think there's a lot of truth to that. Look, we have to focus on what's on the, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=144.8s)]
*  what's going on on the ground there today. There is an immediate crisis there. This was a massacre [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=148.88s)]
*  of innocents and civilians, and the Israelis must be provided everything they need to respond to [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=152.88s)]
*  this in a way that deters this from ever happening again. That was the mistake. You know, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=158.48s)]
*  then the opening moments after this attack, the Biden administration's team on the ground in Israel [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=163.28s)]
*  said, gosh, can't we all just get along? They issued a statement demanding that the Israelis [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=169.35999999999999s)]
*  essentially fold their tent and allow this massacre to continue. That was indecent. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=174.0s)]
*  That was retracted. Just so folks know. But yeah, it was a first response. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=177.67999999999998s)]
*  It was retracted because that's right, it was their first response. It was their instinct, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=181.6s)]
*  Shannon. That's exactly right. This is the Biden administration's instinct, appease at every turn, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=185.44s)]
*  and it's how you get precisely what you described. You described the fact we had 13 Americans killed [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=190.64s)]
*  in Afghanistan. We've seen coups in Africa. We have a ground war in Europe. We have a Chinese [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=195.2s)]
*  Communist Party that is threatening every one of its land-based neighbors and sea-based neighbors. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=200.8s)]
*  When America refuses to do the right thing and lead and use American power in ways that deter [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=206.32s)]
*  adversaries, like the old Southwest Airlines line, they feel free to move about the cabin, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=211.68s)]
*  Shannon. And that's bad for the United States of America. We now have a strategic petroleum reserve [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  with just 17 days of oil amongst the lowest in our American history. We've put America on its back [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=221.52s)]
*  foot, and when you do that, the Iranians will run rough shot over us. And I worry greatly that [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=227.12s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Iranians on the ground in Syria today will seize this moment to do even [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=232.56s)]
*  more harm to the peace that we had built out in the Middle East over our four years in office. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=238.48s)]
*  Yeah, the exchanges with Hezbollah to the north, very concerning as well. Mr. Secretary, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=243.04s)]
*  thank you very much. We always appreciate your insights. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=247.44s)]
*  Thank you, Shannon. Have a great day, ma'am. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=250.39999999999998s)]
*  You too. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bohG8fT_qkE&t=251.83999999999997s)]
