# Biden has reached decision on Iranian response after killing of US soldiers
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI)
*  President Biden says he's decided how America will respond to Iran and its proxy forces [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=0.0s)]
*  after three U.S. soldiers were killed in a drone attack. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=5.64s)]
*  Do you think it's a responsible attack? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=8.64s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=13.64s)]
*  Do you hold Iran responsible for the death of those three Americans? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=14.64s)]
*  I do hold them responsible in the sense that they're supplying the weapons to the people [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=19.64s)]
*  who did it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=25.64s)]
*  OK, North Carolina Senator Ted Budd joins me now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=26.64s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=29.880000000000003s)]
*  The Biden administration was out there a lot yesterday talking about their response. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=31.1s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=36.28s)]
*  Wouldn't it have been better just to do it rather than foreshadow it this? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=37.28s)]
*  This has been an administration of hesitation and half measures. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=42.72s)]
*  It's been about weakness, which has provoked Iran and their proxies. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=46.16s)]
*  It's cost American lives now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=51.44s)]
*  We've had over 160, maybe up to 200 different attacks through the proxies. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=53.56s)]
*  And again, we've lost American lives through his hesitation and half measures and his weakness. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=58.24s)]
*  If you go back to what Trump did in 2020, he was strong when a single contractor was [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=62.54s)]
*  killed. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=67.0s)]
*  He went after Soleimani, made him a martyr. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=68.0s)]
*  We need to do more of that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=69.88s)]
*  We need to be clear. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=70.88s)]
*  We need to be strong. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=71.88s)]
*  That's deterrence. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=73.16s)]
*  National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that the response will likely [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=74.16s)]
*  come in phases. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  He says it's very possible that when you'll see it, it's going to be a tiered approach, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=78.56s)]
*  not just a single action, but potentially multiple actions over a period of time. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=83.16s)]
*  John Kirby knows that when he says things like that, he's not just talking to the American [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=87.96s)]
*  people. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=91.0s)]
*  He's also speaking to Iran, who's listening very closely to what he and the president [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=92.0s)]
*  says. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=96.03999999999999s)]
*  What do you think they're signaling there? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Read between the lines. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=98.03999999999999s)]
*  That they don't want to go overboard. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=100.08s)]
*  What we need to do is have a strong reaction. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=101.44s)]
*  I've been with the Fifth Fleet before. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=103.16s)]
*  We have everything that we need in the region if we just give them the permission to do [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=105.3s)]
*  what they need to do to stop Iran in its tracks. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=110.33999999999999s)]
*  Do you think the Biden administration should attack Iran directly? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=112.6s)]
*  Do you support that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=118.08s)]
*  Look, we don't want a war with Iran, but what we want to do is we want to stop the [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=119.08s)]
*  attacks that we've had. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=123.91999999999999s)]
*  Again, 160 of these minor attacks that have escalated over and over and over again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=125.64s)]
*  If we don't attack clearly and strongly, we know exactly what to do. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  We don't want a war, but again, we have everything we need to stop this aggression from Iran. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=137.88s)]
*  Also, sanctions as well is a big element to this. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=142.23999999999998s)]
*  To pull funding from Iran so that they can't supply this money to these Iranian proxy forces [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=147.0s)]
*  who are now attacking our service members and three unfortunately have died. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  We've also lost two Navy SEALs and we still have Americans that are hostages in Gaza. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  Something needs to change and it needs to change quickly. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=163.44s)]
*  On the Gaza front, Senator, your colleague Bernie Sanders, he made a comment yesterday [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=166.27999999999997s)]
*  that's getting a lot of attention. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=170.64s)]
*  He was talking about this UN Palestinian relief organization called UNRWA. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=172.35999999999999s)]
*  According to the Israelis, 12 of their employees took part in the October 7th terror attack [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=176.64s)]
*  in really brutal ways, including kidnapping, raiding a kibbutz, doling out ammunition. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  A new report says that 10% of this UN organization's staff has ties to terrorist organizations. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  Bernie Sanders now says that the US should restore funding to this group. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=196.56s)]
*  He says obviously it's not acceptable for any of the 13,000 UNRWA employees in Gaza [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=201.2s)]
*  to be involved with Hamas and allegations against the 12 people charged must be investigated. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=205.95999999999998s)]
*  However, we cannot allow millions to suffer because of the actions of 12. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=210.92s)]
*  The US and other countries must restore funding to stave off this humanitarian catastrophe. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=215.88s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=221.01999999999998s)]
*  Well, we need to know with a full investigation and exposure of those that were involved with [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=222.51999999999998s)]
*  the attacks, who was involved, who were enabling it, what's the ideology there. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=228.12s)]
*  All the dollars that we've seen so far, it's led to the purchase of rockets, it's led [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=232.0s)]
*  to the digging of tunnels, it's led to the radicalization of the people. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  So again, we need to really dig in, see what this is. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=240.08s)]
*  Obviously we need to stop it right now and perhaps permanently. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=243.38000000000002s)]
*  Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Rashida Tlaib also think that we should turn [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=246.88s)]
*  the money back on to this organization, this UN organization. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=251.44s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=254.88s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anm8Edd-yGI&t=255.88s)]
