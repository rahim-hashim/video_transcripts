# Dems seem to really like to lose: Meghan McCain
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY)
*  Citizen McCain on Two Way, who recently sat down, by the way, with the second lady, Usha [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=0.0s)]
*  Vance, for a wide-ranging interview. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=7.0s)]
*  Meghan McCain is back. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=9.4s)]
*  Meghan, great to have you back. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=10.4s)]
*  How are you? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=11.4s)]
*  I'm good. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=12.4s)]
*  I hear you have good news. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=13.4s)]
*  Thank you so much for having me, Sean. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=14.4s)]
*  Congratulations are in order. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=15.4s)]
*  I heard about it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=16.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=17.88s)]
*  Yes, I'm pregnant with my third child. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=18.88s)]
*  Ben and I are so excited. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=21.48s)]
*  And it probably feels a little weird for you. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=23.2s)]
*  You've known me since I was very young. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=25.36s)]
*  And we're just really thrilled. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=27.04s)]
*  You know, it's such a blessing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=28.52s)]
*  And I'm just, I'm, we're going to have three kids and I'm about to be a boy mom. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=29.52s)]
*  So anybody that has any advice about going from two to three or having boys, please send [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=33.72s)]
*  me as much advice as possible. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=38.28s)]
*  If you want my advice, I'll give it to you offline. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=41.56s)]
*  You go through this beautiful period when they're little, then you lose them for a few [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=44.84s)]
*  years and then eventually they come back. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=48.24s)]
*  It's those interim years that are the hard ones. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=50.6s)]
*  Congratulations. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=54.040000000000006s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=55.040000000000006s)]
*  You know, I watched the Democrats and listened to them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=56.08s)]
*  Stephen A. Smith gives me a hard time. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=59.6s)]
*  He's my buddy. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=61.2s)]
*  And he says, you know, you love to play AOC and Jasmine Crockett and Al Green and crazy, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=62.2s)]
*  you know, Grandpa Bernie, because you want the world to realize they're the Democratic [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=70.08s)]
*  Party, but they do control the Democratic Party. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=75.12s)]
*  We haven't, that I've seen, I haven't heard from Chuck Schumer or Hakeem Jeffries about [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=78.48s)]
*  taking out Iran's nuclear facility because they're afraid of the radicals that do run [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=83.08s)]
*  that party. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=88.4s)]
*  Am I wrong? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=89.4s)]
*  No, you're completely right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=90.4s)]
*  And I think, you know, I respect Stephen A. Smith, but these are the people the Democrats [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=92.32s)]
*  are putting front and center. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=95.88s)]
*  And Jasmine Crockett is a deeply unserious person who I think only got elected to enhance [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=97.36s)]
*  her social media presence. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=103.98s)]
*  And you know, she goes on her social media and makes these ridiculously absurd outlandish [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=105.84s)]
*  videos. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=110.12s)]
*  She has no background at all in national security, in the military, in anything that in any reason [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=111.16000000000001s)]
*  should give her an opinion on what's happening in Iran, and is, quite frankly, pretty, you [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=117.76s)]
*  know, angry and histrionic in these videos. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=122.76s)]
*  And I think it's for the sole purpose, honestly, is to get people talking on shows like this [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=125.72s)]
*  and to get attention. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  I don't think she's going to pass a bill. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=132.04000000000002s)]
*  I don't think she has any kind of real future. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=133.6s)]
*  I think, unfortunately for the Democrats, the problem is they have this whole group [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=135.24s)]
*  of young talent coming up in their party who only care about being famous. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=139.60000000000002s)]
*  They don't care about helping the American people and they don't care about helping [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  passing bills or actually getting anything done. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=147.44s)]
*  And I think she's patient zero in that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  The thing that I have seen happen, and I don't think the Democratic Party is the party of [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=152.56s)]
*  working men and women. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  They used to claim to have that mantle and they had all the union support. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=159.48000000000002s)]
*  That support is now evaporated. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  For example, why would they be against the one big beautiful bill that cuts taxes for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=165.9s)]
*  working Americans? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=171.9s)]
*  Why would they be against or vote against, you know, no tax on tips, no tax on overtime? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=173.5s)]
*  Why would they be against secure borders? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=179.74s)]
*  Why are they for or championing the rights of men to play women's sports? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=182.02s)]
*  Why are they fighting for the Abrego Garcías of the world or, you know, torturing Donald [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=186.46s)]
*  Trump and ICE for doing their job and arresting murderers and child molesters and other violent [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=191.18s)]
*  criminals and cartel members out in California? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=197.38s)]
*  That's what the parties evolved into. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=200.3s)]
*  Well, and when you look at the data that came out from the last election on how much President [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=203.1s)]
*  Trump was able to expand his coalition in every minority group, in every segment of [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=207.42000000000002s)]
*  the population, except white college educated women, he has completely remade the Republican [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=212.22s)]
*  Party and the Democrat Party has become a minority party. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=217.54000000000002s)]
*  There are fewer people registered, fewer people voting. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=221.02s)]
*  It's why they're having so many problems. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=223.86s)]
*  And the thing I don't understand is when Republicans have lost elections, we have taken time to [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=225.58s)]
*  assess why and thought about new leadership and thought about what we're doing wrong. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=230.86s)]
*  Democrats just seem to like to lose. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  I mean, you brought up the biological men and women's sports issue. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=237.70000000000002s)]
*  That's an 80 percent of the American public disagrees with that. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=241.62s)]
*  Twenty percent of the American public agree. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=246.06s)]
*  And that's an issue that they're going to double, triple down until the end of time. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  I actually think Democrats at this point would prefer to lose and keep their radical stances [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=253.14000000000001s)]
*  than ever win any election. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=258.26s)]
*  And you brought up the fact I just had the privilege to interview our second lady, Mrs. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=260.18s)]
*  Vance, and I actually believe there is a very strong potential. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=265.90000000000003s)]
*  I would put a lot of money in Las Vegas that our vice president is going to be president [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=270.86s)]
*  not only because he's extremely talented and popular, but because Democrats have nothing [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=276.65999999999997s)]
*  and they have learned no lessons. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=280.46s)]
*  They fight and champion the right of men to play women's sports. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=282.86s)]
*  They champion the rights of people that did not respect our laws, our borders and our [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=286.46s)]
*  sovereignty over the safety of Americans. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=291.54s)]
*  They couldn't stand for mothers that lost their children to Biden-Harris unvetted illegals [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=294.14s)]
*  at the joint session speech. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=299.94s)]
*  They're not standing for working men and women when it comes to the economy. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=303.34s)]
*  And you know, if you go back to Trump's first term, for example, demographically, you mentioned [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=307.65999999999997s)]
*  demographics, African Americans, Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, women in the workplace, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=311.26s)]
*  African American youth unemployment prior to COVID, record low after record low after [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=317.5s)]
*  record low. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=322.14s)]
*  And that to me shows in the 10 trillion investments, automobile manufacturing, semiconductor manufacturing, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=323.62s)]
*  pharmaceutical manufacturing, 10 trillion dollars Donald Trump has in commitments the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=330.18s)]
*  next four years. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=334.86s)]
*  Working men and women are going to get high paying career jobs. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=336.42s)]
*  And that's great for the economy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=339.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=341.3s)]
*  And what are Democrats doing right now? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=342.3s)]
*  As you showed in the clip a minute ago, Congressman Al Green is putting up impeachment proceedings [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=344.42s)]
*  that got almost no votes. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=349.06s)]
*  Their answer is not coming up with solutions or policy changes or trying to find any kind [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=350.96000000000004s)]
*  of synergy where we can possibly agree on issues. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=355.36s)]
*  Their answer is just this bizarre obsession with impeachment and trying to take President [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=358.76s)]
*  Trump out. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=363.65999999999997s)]
*  President Trump is one of the most paradigm shifting presidents of any generation. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=364.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't care if you support him or don't support him. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=371.12s)]
*  You cannot negate that. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=373.2s)]
*  He is one of the most popular presidents that we've had in the past four decades. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=374.58s)]
*  And the idea that you are going to somehow take out his popularity by trying to impeach [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=378.44s)]
*  him again, you arrested him, you raided his home, you tried everything you could possibly [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=382.48s)]
*  do in every way to take him out using, in my opinion, you know, unjust legal ways. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=387.76s)]
*  And your answer right now is trying to impeach him again after he justly, fairly, within [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=394.32s)]
*  all his rights and powers as our commander in chief, got rid of nuclear places in Iran, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=399.48s)]
*  which is making the world a better place and a safer place. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=406.6s)]
*  I just look, I don't understand it. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A_gT9bUNTLY&t=409.16s)]
