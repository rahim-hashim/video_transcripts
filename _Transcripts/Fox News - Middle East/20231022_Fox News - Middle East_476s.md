# ‘DISTURBING TREND’: Biden admin ignores intelligence, says John Ratcliffe
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms)
*  Now here is a flashback from this program back in 2021. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=0.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=4.0s)]
*  The path that the Biden administration has chosen [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=5.64s)]
*  with respect to Iran means that there's going to be chaos [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=8.040000000000001s)]
*  and war in other places in the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=11.16s)]
*  If you give Iran more money to fund terrorism [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=13.24s)]
*  like they've done in the past with the $100 billion [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=17.0s)]
*  that the Obama-Biden administration gave them [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=19.92s)]
*  in the first failed JCPOA agreement, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  they're only going to do that again. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  I think it's really troubling, Maria, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=26.84s)]
*  that the approach that the Biden administration has taken [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=29.0s)]
*  is to take our sovereign ally in the Middle East, Israel, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  and bring them down to the same level [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  where they've raised Hamas, a terrorist organization, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=37.56s)]
*  and said both parties are at fault. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=40.24s)]
*  I think that's really a tragic [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=42.24s)]
*  and troubling foreign policy approach. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=44.04s)]
*  And we welcome back to the program [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=48.28s)]
*  the former director of national intelligence, John Ratcliffe. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  John, you could not have been more spot on [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=52.08s)]
*  in that interview back in May of 2021. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=54.58s)]
*  Your reaction to what has played out? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=57.4s)]
*  Well, Maria, it's not that I was good [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=61.4s)]
*  at predicting the future. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=63.6s)]
*  It was that I was good at reading our intelligence reports. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  Look, throughout 2020, the Iranian military leaders [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=68.2s)]
*  and political leaders were telling us [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=74.16s)]
*  as we listened in on their conversations, we're broke. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=76.52s)]
*  We can't afford to fund Hamas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=79.64s)]
*  We can't afford to fund Hezbollah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=81.16s)]
*  We can't afford to pay our proxies to engage in this mayhem. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=83.52s)]
*  Essentially saying the maximum pressure campaign [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=87.92s)]
*  of the Trump administration was working [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=90.84s)]
*  and Iran was less dangerous [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=93.47999999999999s)]
*  than they had been at any point in time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=97.67999999999999s)]
*  And I think what's unfortunate, Maria, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  is all of that intelligence, which spoke so clearly, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=101.39999999999999s)]
*  was shared with the Biden administration. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=105.39999999999999s)]
*  As they came in, they were very much aware of that. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=107.44s)]
*  And unfortunately, it's this disturbing trend [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=110.36s)]
*  that we saw over and over again [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=113.88000000000001s)]
*  where they simply just ignored the intelligence. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=114.72s)]
*  They ignored it in Afghanistan and it led to disaster there. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=117.12s)]
*  They ignored the intelligence at our southern border. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=120.44s)]
*  It led to disaster there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=122.60000000000001s)]
*  And they ignored the intelligence in the Middle East. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=124.08s)]
*  And now we're on, it's not being hyperbolic to say [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=126.04s)]
*  we're on the verge of a war in the Middle East. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=129.04s)]
*  And to underscore just how, what a colossal failure [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=132.52s)]
*  the Biden administration policy on Iran is, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=138.2s)]
*  literally two weeks before this atrocity [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=142.24s)]
*  against both Israelis and Americans took place, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=145.56s)]
*  you had President Biden's national security advisor, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=148.88s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, bragging about how great things were [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=152.44s)]
*  in the Middle East, saying it had never been quieter [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=156.44s)]
*  and he wasn't having to spend any time in the Middle East. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=158.68s)]
*  And so, it really underscores the failure [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=162.32s)]
*  of the Biden policy in Iran. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=165.88s)]
*  And it's actually worse than what they did in Afghanistan. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=167.56s)]
*  Look, 13 Americans died needlessly [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=170.72s)]
*  because they didn't follow what our intelligence told us [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=173.32s)]
*  about a conditions-based withdrawal in Afghanistan. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=175.96s)]
*  30 Americans were butchered by Hamas [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=178.96s)]
*  in these attacks two weeks ago. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=183.0s)]
*  And I just, again, it's just unfortunate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=185.36s)]
*  and a disturbing trend from this administration [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=188.76s)]
*  not to listen to the intelligence that was so clear. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=192.2s)]
*  And you gave them that intelligence on the way out, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=195.68s)]
*  didn't you? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=198.76s)]
*  You explained all of this to your successor. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=199.6s)]
*  Very clearly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=204.84s)]
*  I mean, the intelligence on this was unequivocal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=206.2s)]
*  and that was that Iran was essentially broke. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=210.79999999999998s)]
*  They were saying that themselves in the communications [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=216.76s)]
*  that we are able to listen to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  and the Biden administration was very aware of that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=222.0s)]
*  and yet they reversed course. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=224.76s)]
*  And you wonder why, Maria? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=226.44s)]
*  Well, what Senator Cruz just told you [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  is now the inescapable truth. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=233.16s)]
*  It turns out that Iran was negotiating with Iran, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=235.32s)]
*  that in talking with the Biden administration, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=240.16s)]
*  it was pro-Iranian, anti-Israeli negotiators [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=242.68s)]
*  on everything from nuclear negotiations [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=247.32s)]
*  to hostage negotiations. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=250.64s)]
*  And as we all sat there and wondered why such a bad deal, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=252.32s)]
*  why would the Biden administration enter into such a bad deal [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=256.36s)]
*  with Iran time and time again, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=260.36s)]
*  we now know that there was [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=261.96000000000004s)]
*  a successful Iranian influence campaign [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=263.8s)]
*  and that as the Senator talked about, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=267.84000000000003s)]
*  not one, not two, not three, but four different, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=270.88s)]
*  at least Iranian operatives essentially working [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=273.64s)]
*  within the Biden administration, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=276.92s)]
*  even on things like our special operations against Iran [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=278.68s)]
*  at the same time that they're communicating [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  with the Iranian foreign minister. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=284.36s)]
*  It's really appalling and it's one of the reasons, Maria, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=286.96s)]
*  that Secretary Pompeo and others and myself [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=289.4s)]
*  have urged in a letter to this administration [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=294.76s)]
*  to put our national security [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=297.28s)]
*  in front of their political interests [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=298.76s)]
*  to address that problem. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=300.44s)]
*  Well, we've been trying to get this administration [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=302.56s)]
*  to put national security as the priority [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=305.08s)]
*  since he walked into the Oval Office, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  but to no avail, look at the wide open border. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=309.68s)]
*  We've got terrorists coming in. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=312.96s)]
*  But John, I wanna get your take on the ammunition here [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=314.76000000000005s)]
*  and who has the capacity to empower Hamas [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=317.68s)]
*  with these weapons? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  You know this, you've seen the data, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=323.44000000000005s)]
*  you've seen the classified information [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=326.32000000000005s)]
*  in terms of who specifically has these weapons. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=328.48s)]
*  We're talking about a new axis of evil, aren't we? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=331.44000000000005s)]
*  We're talking about Iran, Russia, China, North Korea. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=334.0s)]
*  And I also wanted to get your take [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=338.52000000000004s)]
*  in terms of the people working [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  within the administration right now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=344.2s)]
*  You said Iran negotiating with Iran. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=347.12s)]
*  Absolutely, and that's what's troubling [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=351.48s)]
*  is that some of those folks with top secret clearances [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=353.88s)]
*  are aware of, they should not have access [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=357.32s)]
*  to the decisions that we're making against Iran right now [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=360.0s)]
*  when they're sympathizing with Iran. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=363.72s)]
*  But to the issue of weapons, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=366.24s)]
*  part of what makes this, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=367.72s)]
*  we're in uncharted waters, Maria, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=369.12s)]
*  and Israel is facing something [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=372.0s)]
*  that no one really can tell you [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=374.12s)]
*  how this is going to play out [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=376.2s)]
*  because we're all aware of the fact [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=377.72s)]
*  that Israel's gonna go in [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=380.4s)]
*  with some sort of ground invasion into Gaza. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=381.6s)]
*  But the greater threat is to the north with Hezbollah. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=384.68s)]
*  Instead of homemade rockets, which is what Hamas has, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=388.84000000000003s)]
*  Hezbollah has a fighting force of 100,000. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=392.04s)]
*  They have somewhere between 75,000 [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=395.52s)]
*  and 130,000 precision guided missiles. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=397.79999999999995s)]
*  And here's why that's important, Maria. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=400.56s)]
*  Unlike the Hamas rocket that just went astray [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=402.24s)]
*  and took out a hospital, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=405.03999999999996s)]
*  a precision guided missile or drone [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  can hit a target from hundreds of miles away [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=409.35999999999996s)]
*  within five to 10 meters. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=411.84s)]
*  And that is what Hezbollah has the capacity [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=414.08s)]
*  to rain on Israel's Iron Dome. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=417.56s)]
*  And we just don't know whether that defense system [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=420.08s)]
*  will hold up against that. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=422.08s)]
*  That's before we even get into [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=423.59999999999997s)]
*  the potential of ballistic missiles from Iran. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=426.36s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna be talking about the Abraham Accords [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=428.64s)]
*  coming up in the program. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=431.24s)]
*  This was peace. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=432.71999999999997s)]
*  And we were hoping for peace throughout the Middle East [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=434.0s)]
*  with the Abraham Accords, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=436.92s)]
*  which was engineered by the Trump administration. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=438.24s)]
*  We should point out that while all of this was going on, [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=440.92s)]
*  what was happening in China, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=443.52s)]
*  the Communist Party of China [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=445.52s)]
*  was meeting with Vladimir Putin. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=446.84s)]
*  This is without a doubt helped China militarily, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=450.28s)]
*  economically, diplomatically, absolutely. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=454.8s)]
*  John, thank you. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=459.04s)]
*  The Chinese are very happy [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=459.88s)]
*  about the developments in the Middle East. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=460.72s)]
*  You bet, Maria, thank you. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=462.24s)]
*  John Radcliffe, good to see you, sir, thank you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oQFLqCzcLms&t=463.48s)]
