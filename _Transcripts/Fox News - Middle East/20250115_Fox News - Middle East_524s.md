# Trump's 'hell to pay' threat looms over Israel-Hamas cease-fire deal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ)
*  But I want to bring in Colonel Darren Gobb. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  And Colonel, you and I have talked all along about this [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=3.08s)]
*  and how we might reach this moment, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=6.44s)]
*  but they're calling it phase one. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=8.32s)]
*  And there's celebration in the streets. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=10.4s)]
*  There's hope in the streets in Tel Aviv [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=12.16s)]
*  and other places across the country of Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  But this is also not a done deal. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=17.04s)]
*  These hostages have not yet been released. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=19.22s)]
*  And so we hope and we pray. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=21.84s)]
*  But what's going on, do you suspect, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=24.12s)]
*  behind the scenes diplomatically [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=25.76s)]
*  and our role as the United States? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=27.16s)]
*  Yeah, Harris, and good afternoon. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=30.96s)]
*  Good to see you again. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=33.04s)]
*  I suspect behind the scenes, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=34.28s)]
*  the debates will continue for quite a while to see, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=36.44s)]
*  what has Israel given up in terms of their national security, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=41.24s)]
*  in terms of the ground they've gained in Gaza, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=45.76s)]
*  and by the way, also in Lebanon. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  And they're going to monitor very closely [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=50.64s)]
*  the specific terms of the deal [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=53.16s)]
*  and whether or not they're being adhered to by both sides. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=55.24s)]
*  As if we've learned anything from history, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=58.5s)]
*  specifically with Hamas and the way Yasser Arafat [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=60.22s)]
*  trained Hamas to deal with foreign entities, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=63.7s)]
*  like the United States and other nations, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=66.78s)]
*  was that war is deceit. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=68.34s)]
*  And any deal that they strike is usually done only [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=69.86s)]
*  to give themselves some sort of an advantage [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=73.94s)]
*  for a period of time. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=76.3s)]
*  Time. To where they can re-engage [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=77.74000000000001s)]
*  what they were doing before. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=81.38s)]
*  Hopefully not. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=82.62s)]
*  Obviously we would love to see hostages return to families [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=83.53999999999999s)]
*  and that will be a scene that will be wonderful to see. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=86.42s)]
*  But how long will it actually last? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=89.74000000000001s)]
*  Can you give us some perspective on why there are 16 days? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=94.22s)]
*  Does that amount of time have some significance? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=97.62s)]
*  Like I'm trying to figure out, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=99.74000000000001s)]
*  so you're going to hold the male soldiers and men back [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=101.1s)]
*  for 16 days until the next phase. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=104.5s)]
*  I mean, this is a situation where so many of their worst [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=106.62s)]
*  who were imprisoned in Israel [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=111.02000000000001s)]
*  get to go home now back to Gaza or anywhere [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=112.66s)]
*  in any country I would imagine who would take them. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=116.38s)]
*  It doesn't just have to be across the border from Israel. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=119.74s)]
*  So why 16 days? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=124.53999999999999s)]
*  And do you think that that is a stall? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=126.78s)]
*  Well, yeah, 16 days could certainly be a stall. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=130.9s)]
*  And when I see that number, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=133.57999999999998s)]
*  I make a lot of assumptions and possibilities [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=135.18s)]
*  about what that could mean. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=139.9s)]
*  One is, does it give time for Israel [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=142.1s)]
*  to actually reposition forces [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=144.57999999999998s)]
*  in accordance with the deal that is signed? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=146.22s)]
*  Do they have to move the city to get more people? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=148.66s)]
*  Second of all, where are the hostages? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=151.7s)]
*  Do they actually have to be returned [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=153.89999999999998s)]
*  from somewhere further than the Gaza Strip? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=155.54s)]
*  We don't really know where they are [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=157.82s)]
*  or how many they are in Hamas themselves. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=159.62s)]
*  May not really even know themselves either [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=162.94s)]
*  because Hamas does not operate [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=165.14s)]
*  like we understand a true military force [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=167.45999999999998s)]
*  where there is a single person in charge [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=170.85999999999999s)]
*  and everybody just simply obeys them. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=173.22s)]
*  They could have taken a hostage [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=175.66s)]
*  and moved them somewhere else [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=176.94s)]
*  and the Hamas leadership who are not in Gaza [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=178.06s)]
*  may not know where they are. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=181.5s)]
*  So they're trying to give themselves sometimes [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=182.74s)]
*  to do some of these things. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=184.94s)]
*  Hopefully there's some positive stuff [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=186.5s)]
*  built into that timeline, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=188.18s)]
*  the details we haven't seen yet. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=189.26000000000002s)]
*  But I guess we'll know whether or not this deal holds. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=192.02s)]
*  My guess would be that within a week, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  we'll know whether it's gonna stick at all. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=197.38s)]
*  So Colonel, I really wanna try to get an understanding [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=199.5s)]
*  of America's role at this point [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=202.14s)]
*  because we're about to have a new president come in. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=203.89999999999998s)]
*  And as my co-host, Kayleigh McEnany pointed out, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=207.29999999999998s)]
*  you may be seeing some of this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=209.7s)]
*  because of what incoming president Donald Trump [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=211.22s)]
*  said directly to Hamas, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=214.01999999999998s)]
*  all hell will break out if you don't let those hostages go [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=216.38s)]
*  before he takes office next Monday at noon. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=219.94s)]
*  So you can't ignore that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=223.66s)]
*  He said it more than once. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=225.42s)]
*  The world takes him seriously. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=227.22s)]
*  I would imagine within the world, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=228.89999999999998s)]
*  so do the bloodthirsty killers of Hamas. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=230.3s)]
*  So what is our role at this point? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=233.3s)]
*  And as Biden leaves the current president, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=235.38000000000002s)]
*  are you concerned at all about any sort of promises [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=239.10000000000002s)]
*  or dealings that have gone on? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=241.74s)]
*  I mean, it's been very, very much like quicksand [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=243.22s)]
*  in the United States with regard to the border, for example. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=246.06s)]
*  Him taking out of play more than 600 million acres [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=249.3s)]
*  for oil production in this country. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=254.86s)]
*  Are you worried that he would make one of those [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=256.98s)]
*  legacy point deals in this and what might it look like? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=259.18s)]
*  I absolutely am worried. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=264.5s)]
*  And in fact, I wrote a long piece about this [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=265.94s)]
*  describing the fact that I thought [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=267.9s)]
*  that America's point of greatest risk [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=269.46s)]
*  was actually between a Trump victory in November [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=270.9s)]
*  and the inauguration and the kind of deals [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=273.29999999999995s)]
*  that Joe Biden would put on the table or sign [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  that seemed to be designed specifically [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=279.02s)]
*  to do as much damage as he can [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=281.46s)]
*  in the remaining days of his administration. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=283.94s)]
*  And you mentioned some of those already. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=286.38s)]
*  Could this be another one? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=288.38s)]
*  That remains to be seen. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=290.34s)]
*  But like you said, Trump said, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=291.58s)]
*  there will be hell on earth to pay [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=293.61999999999995s)]
*  for not having a hostage deal in place before he comes in. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=295.85999999999996s)]
*  And what's a big difference between [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=299.41999999999996s)]
*  a typical incoming president and this one? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=301.21999999999997s)]
*  Well, this one has a track record [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  and he's proven the fact that he's willing [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=305.94s)]
*  to be very aggressive and he's going to fulfill [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=307.41999999999996s)]
*  what he says he's going to do. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=310.05999999999995s)]
*  And Hamas leadership does not want [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=312.05999999999995s)]
*  to find out what that is. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=314.21999999999997s)]
*  We know one thing about Hamas leadership. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=315.78s)]
*  They're not in Gaza taking the risk of the people there [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=317.94s)]
*  and the rest of the people that they hire [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=321.09999999999997s)]
*  on the Hamas actual quasi-military side. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=323.26s)]
*  They don't want to find out what it's like [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=327.21999999999997s)]
*  to be a direct target potentially [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=329.41999999999996s)]
*  of a Trump fulfilled promise [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=332.85999999999996s)]
*  just like he did with Soleimani. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=335.5s)]
*  Exactly, I was just going to say, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=337.85999999999996s)]
*  you want to know what he'll do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=339.14s)]
*  You can't ask the Iran-driven terrorist Soleimani [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=340.53999999999996s)]
*  because he's gone. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=344.26s)]
*  You can't look at a situation [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=345.62s)]
*  and remember back to when he was president [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=347.66s)]
*  a few years ago and the war in Syria. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=350.1s)]
*  And when Kim weapons were used, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=354.06s)]
*  he sent those Tomahawk missiles in there. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=355.58000000000004s)]
*  So some of the leadership even then [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=357.70000000000005s)]
*  and their military on the ground working against us [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=359.98s)]
*  and trying to kill the people in Syria [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  who would fight back, you can't ask them either [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=364.94000000000005s)]
*  because he took some things out of play, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=367.66s)]
*  not just weaponry, but some killers too. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=370.02000000000004s)]
*  Kennedy has a question for you, Colonel. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=372.14000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for being with us. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=374.14000000000004s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, thank you so much for taking the time. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=376.06s)]
*  And as we talk about American politics and foreign policy [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=378.5s)]
*  and the overlap between two administrations, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=382.42s)]
*  we also think about the threat here and the homeland. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=385.46s)]
*  And just a few short weeks ago, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=389.18s)]
*  murderous American citizen radicalized [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=392.9s)]
*  and mowed down dozens of people in New Orleans [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=396.06s)]
*  as they were celebrating New Year's Eve. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=399.74s)]
*  This person pledged allegiance to ISIS. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=402.38s)]
*  And I'm wondering as we've focused so much on Hamas, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=405.02s)]
*  is there a correlation here between the potential strength [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=408.94s)]
*  and ISIS growing while we did not have our eye on them? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=412.97999999999996s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=419.85999999999996s)]
*  I mean, if you back out of this [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=420.74s)]
*  and look not only at Israel and Gaza, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=423.65999999999997s)]
*  but you start bringing in Russia, Ukraine, [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  China and the Sentinel, what's happening in Syria [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=430.26s)]
*  and all the different pieces and parts around the world [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=434.58s)]
*  and you build a bigger picture, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=436.73999999999995s)]
*  what you see is that they all know [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=438.78s)]
*  that our greatest weakness in America right now [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=440.97999999999996s)]
*  is our border and the lack of control over it. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=443.41999999999996s)]
*  And I know for a fact that there are people [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=446.62s)]
*  coming across the Southern border that are here [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=448.58s)]
*  for purposes that terrorist groups would be here for, [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=451.94s)]
*  whether they be ISIS or Al Qaeda or sympathizers, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=454.82s)]
*  whether they be drug gangs. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=457.82s)]
*  That's a significant risk to the homeland [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=459.38s)]
*  because what's the greatest way a nation overseas [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=461.54s)]
*  could distract America from being able to respond in force [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=465.3s)]
*  to a true threat somewhere in the Pacific, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=468.94s)]
*  Middle East, Europe, doesn't matter, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=472.78000000000003s)]
*  is to create significant crises in our own homeland [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=474.66s)]
*  with our own infrastructure. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=478.18s)]
*  And one guy driving a truck is one example. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=480.22s)]
*  There are thousands more possibilities there. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=482.98s)]
*  Right, and the backdrop of course is the border situation, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=484.78000000000003s)]
*  which we can never avoid talking about [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=487.5s)]
*  because we have so many people we don't know [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=489.94s)]
*  who's really here who've come across [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=491.66s)]
*  and the eight plus million people [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=493.78s)]
*  who've come during Biden's time. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=495.9s)]
*  The vetting processes we know were so poor [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=497.66s)]
*  or non-existent among those who came here [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=499.98s)]
*  illegally in particular. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=503.38s)]
*  Colonel Dopp, thank you very much. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WEj7r0z9fHQ&t=505.22s)]
