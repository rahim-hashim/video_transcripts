# Biden admin reportedly encouraging Israel to end 'high intensity' phase of war
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo)
*  Right now, National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan is in Israel meeting with Israeli [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Isaac Herzog this morning after talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=6.84s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=12.08s)]
*  And just a short time ago, Jake Sullivan addressed reports that the Biden administration wants [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=13.08s)]
*  Israel to end the quote, high intensity phase of its war against Hamas. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  We are now in the middle of a high intensity phase with ongoing ground operations, military [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=25.48s)]
*  operations in both the northern half and the southern half of Gaza. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=30.36s)]
*  But there will be a transition to another phase of this war, one that is focused in [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=34.76s)]
*  more precise ways on targeting the leadership and on intelligence driven operations that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=41.04s)]
*  continues to deal with the ongoing threat that Hamas poses. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=47.2s)]
*  Controversial report that he is aiming to clarify there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=51.08s)]
*  You're watching Fox and Friends First on this Friday morning. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=53.68s)]
*  I'm Carly Schimkes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=55.64s)]
*  And I'm Todd Pyro. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=56.64s)]
*  But the controversy grows, Carly, because while Sullivan leads talks on the ground back [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=57.64s)]
*  at home, Vice President Harris is reportedly at odds with her boss, President Biden, over [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  a lack of White House support for the Palestinian people. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  Greg Palcutt live in southern Israel with the very latest. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=70.0s)]
*  Greg. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=72.44s)]
*  Hey, Todd, Carly, we are about a mile away from the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=73.44s)]
*  We are hearing outgoing artillery hitting Hamas locations over in that location. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=78.88s)]
*  And that is exactly what National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan has been talking about [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  for two days here in Israel. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=89.64s)]
*  He met with more officials today. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=92.84s)]
*  Yesterday, there were some pretty intense sessions between him, Israeli Prime Minister [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=94.67999999999999s)]
*  Netanyahu and other officials. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=99.52s)]
*  He was putting forth a line coming from President Biden and nudge, as you noted even further [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=102.24s)]
*  by Vice President Harris, that the war has to shift from a less intense, brutal phase [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  to a more targeted approach. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=114.55999999999999s)]
*  Here's a bit more of what he just had to say. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  We had a very constructive conversation yesterday about the transition from the high intensity [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=120.36s)]
*  phase forward. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=125.97999999999999s)]
*  And we expect that that will occur in the future. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=127.39999999999999s)]
*  When exactly that happens and under exactly what conditions will be continuing intensive [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=130.48s)]
*  discussion between the United States and Israel. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=135.28s)]
*  A little bit big, big there, but indeed talking about the talks that Jake Sullivan has been [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=139.52s)]
*  having as the war here on the ground up close continues to be intense. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=145.0s)]
*  The idea of hitting Hamas strongholds up and down the Gaza Strip. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=150.52s)]
*  There are still areas of resistance up north. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=154.3s)]
*  They thought that they had finished them off. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=156.8s)]
*  They haven't. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=158.68s)]
*  And they're aiming towards the strongholds down south as the humanitarian situation in [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=159.68s)]
*  Gaza gets worse and worse. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=164.98s)]
*  Relief trucks are being ransacked as soon as they get into Gaza by desperately hungry [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=167.17999999999998s)]
*  people. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=173.22s)]
*  There's very little shelter, food, medicine. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=174.22s)]
*  The UN described it now as a living hell, as more sadness on the hostage front. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=176.89999999999998s)]
*  We've learned this morning the three more Hamas captives who we thought were alive have [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=183.5s)]
*  now been confirmed to be dead. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  They include two 19 year old soldiers, one Sergeant Ron Sherman, another Corporal Nick [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=191.5s)]
*  Beiser. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=199.34s)]
*  They were both kidnapped from a base not far from the Gaza Strip, as well as a civilian [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=200.34s)]
*  28 year old Elliot Taldano. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=206.14s)]
*  He was seized from that music festival that was targeted by the brutal Hamas terrorists. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  All today and yesterday, too, it must be said that Sullivan and the Israeli officials brought [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=215.86s)]
*  up these hostages as they talked about the ongoing tough war to get rid of Hamas. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=221.28s)]
*  Back to you. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=228.0s)]
*  Great Pal Cut live for us in Israel. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=229.0s)]
*  Greg, thank you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJ-y_fxJ4Vo&t=230.0s)]
