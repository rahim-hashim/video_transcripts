# Rep. Mike Waltz on Afghanistan: This is ‘worse than we think’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ)
*  It is critical that our assistance not be diverted by the Taliban. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, as I sit here today, I cannot assure this committee or the American taxpayer [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=8.76s)]
*  we are not currently funding the Taliban. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=17.6s)]
*  There is a new chapter in the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=21.16s)]
*  A top inspector general warning a house panel that your taxpayer dollars may be ending up [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=25.6s)]
*  in the hands of the Taliban. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=30.32s)]
*  Former Green Beret Republican from Florida, Michael Waltz, member of the House Foreign [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=32.44s)]
*  Affairs Committee. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=35.64s)]
*  Sir, good morning to you. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=36.64s)]
*  Listen, it's been tough to get answers on this. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=37.64s)]
*  Do you think they move the ball at all? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=39.84s)]
*  Or is the news that's coming out of there worse than we think? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=43.68000000000001s)]
*  Bill, I think it's worse than we think. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=48.32s)]
*  And right now everyone's in the dark. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=51.88s)]
*  Anthony Blinken, the secretary of state, has ignored multiple subpoenas from the head of [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=54.96s)]
*  foreign affairs, Mike McCaul. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=61.32s)]
*  He just missed a deadline this week and in fact ignored outreach from the Democrat chair [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=62.96s)]
*  last year on this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=69.76s)]
*  And all we're asking for is a dissent cable and a few other documents. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=71.36s)]
*  Diplomats in Kabul in July of 20 in 2021 said the government is falling. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=77.2s)]
*  This thing is coming unraveled, yet the State Department won't let us see it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=83.36s)]
*  They're saying that, well, no, we have to protect the signers of this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=88.63999999999999s)]
*  We can redact the signers. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=91.91999999999999s)]
*  So we need transparency. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=94.36s)]
*  And my question is, what do they have to hide? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=96.44s)]
*  The president and everyone else in his administration has said this was an outstanding success. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=99.28s)]
*  And on the aid, Bill, let me tell you what, this is billions of dollars. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=104.75999999999999s)]
*  Going through the hands of third parties, including the UN and then to NGOs in Afghanistan. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=109.16000000000001s)]
*  Guess what the Taliban's doing? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=115.68s)]
*  They're registering themselves as international NGOs and they take that money and they literally [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=117.24000000000001s)]
*  make life and death decisions. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=122.96000000000001s)]
*  You're with us. You might get a little bit. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=124.4s)]
*  You're not with us. You die. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  And meanwhile, Al Qaeda is in bed with the Taliban. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=128.6s)]
*  And I guarantee you that money is getting diverted. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=131.76s)]
*  I'm hearing from people still over there. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=134.96s)]
*  Listen, I think it's all maddening to hear about it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=136.92s)]
*  You mentioned this cable. All right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=139.44s)]
*  The State Department is not providing it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=140.72s)]
*  Why? I don't know. I don't know how they operate. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=142.16s)]
*  This is the statement that came out discussions with the committee about next steps are ongoing. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=144.68s)]
*  But the department has again offered a briefing call for number two, guys. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=149.4s)]
*  Thank you. We continue to believe that our offers can satisfactorily provide the committee [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=153.32s)]
*  with the information it needs to conduct its oversight function while still protecting the descent channel. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=157.48s)]
*  Why would they give a briefing and not put something in writing? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=162.64s)]
*  Why would that be? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=166.48s)]
*  You don't have a whistleblower or dissent against an agency. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=167.92s)]
*  And then the agency gets to kind of distill that and tell you and brief you what was in there. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=171.72s)]
*  We want to see the actual document. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=178.2s)]
*  And again, why the lack of transparency if the president standing before the world saying [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=180.23999999999998s)]
*  this is the right thing to do and doubling down, saying it was an outstanding success? [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Well, let us see what these brave diplomats who had the courage to stand up and say this is going to be a [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=189.32s)]
*  disaster. Let us see the Gold Star families deserve transparency. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=195.44s)]
*  The diplomats themselves deserve transparency and the American people do, too. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=200.72s)]
*  And the last thing we should be doing is funding is funding the Taliban on this notion that we can work [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  with the good terrorists against the bad terrorists. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=211.48s)]
*  We made a deal with the devil and it is going to be a disaster. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=213.88s)]
*  I apologize. Talking over you. I'm sorry. I'm just I'm squeezed for time here. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=217.44s)]
*  So I just want to play the sound by from John Stopko. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=220.88s)]
*  He's the special inspector general for Afghanistan reconstruction. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=223.4s)]
*  Just listen to the line he said about what's happening now. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=227.76000000000002s)]
*  I don't trust the Taliban as far as you can throw them. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=232.0s)]
*  I would just say I haven't seen a starving Taliban fighter on TV. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=234.92000000000002s)]
*  They all seem to be fat, dumb and happy. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=239.8s)]
*  I see a lot of starving Afghan children on TV. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=241.92000000000002s)]
*  So I'm wondering where all this funding is going to listen to that. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  You wonder, too. He said since the administration came in, it's been radio silence. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=249.24s)]
*  Last comment on Bill, I think at this point we have to go after the State Department's budget. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=253.52s)]
*  I'm talking to appropriators about it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=258.28000000000003s)]
*  We have to zero this funding out until we can certify it's going to the right people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=260.68s)]
*  And even then, I don't know if that's even possible. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=265.32s)]
*  And, oh, by the way, the other thing he testified, the inspector general yesterday at the current rate, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=268.2s)]
*  it'll take 31 years to get out the people that we left behind. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=273.2s)]
*  And that makes me want to take this podium and throw it through a window. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=277.92s)]
*  It's wrong. It's infuriating. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=281.36s)]
*  And I don't know how Blinken can collect a paycheck with a straight face every day [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=284.88s)]
*  and why he hasn't resigned for leaving these people behind and leaving Americans behind. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=289.48s)]
*  Wow. Michael Waltz will stay on it. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=294.44s)]
*  Thank you for your time today. Appreciate it. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=296.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s34v98SobQ&t=298.4s)]
