# 'GOOD NEWS': Trump makes trade deal with China
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8)
*  Hello everyone, I am Tom Shalhou, along with Molly Line, Lydia Hu and David Webb. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=0.0s)]
*  And welcome to a special edition of The Big Weekend Show. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  Tonight's story. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=11.32s)]
*  It's all about the art of the deal. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=13.64s)]
*  The Trump administration has announced a trade deal has been reached with China. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=15.08s)]
*  This comes after the president hailed the great progress made during yesterday and today's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=19.44s)]
*  meetings in Switzerland. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=22.84s)]
*  Treasury Secretary Scott Besson and Trade Representative Jameson Greer detailed the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=24.64s)]
*  negotiations earlier today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=29.66s)]
*  We made substantial progress between the United States and China in the very important trade [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=32.86s)]
*  talks. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=38.660000000000004s)]
*  We will be giving details tomorrow. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=39.660000000000004s)]
*  But I can tell you that the talks were productive. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=43.7s)]
*  The president declared a national emergency and imposed tariffs. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=46.7s)]
*  And we're confident that the deal we struck with our Chinese partners will help us to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=49.980000000000004s)]
*  resolve work toward resolving that national emergency. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=54.38s)]
*  This all comes as President Trump is set to take his first trip to the Middle East during [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=59.22s)]
*  his second term. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=62.78s)]
*  The president is set to visit with leaders from Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the United Arab [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=63.9s)]
*  Emirates starting Tuesday as the U.S. held another round of nuclear negotiations today [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=67.98s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=74.02s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson is live in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with all the latest. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=75.02s)]
*  Hi Lucas. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=79.02s)]
*  Well, good evening Tom. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=80.02s)]
*  When President Trump first returned to the White House, his first call with a foreign [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=83.3s)]
*  leader was here to Saudi's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=86.84s)]
*  And like his first term, President Trump is taking his first official overseas trip here [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=91.28s)]
*  to Saudi Arabia. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=96.60000000000001s)]
*  As you mentioned, he's also going to continue on to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates as [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=97.60000000000001s)]
*  well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=101.64s)]
*  You mentioned the negotiations going on overseas, not just in Oman, the talks with the Iranians, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=102.64s)]
*  but in Geneva, where Treasury Secretary Scott Besson and Trump's top trade representative [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=106.92s)]
*  Jameson Greer spoke to their Chinese counterparts earlier. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=111.56s)]
*  North Dakota Senator John Hoeven said this is an important first step. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=115.6s)]
*  This is very encouraging. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=121.17999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, they're not going to have a deal fully done. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=122.17999999999999s)]
*  You've got Jameson Greer over there, the U.S. trade representative and the Secretary Besson. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=125.24s)]
*  That's the first string, no doubt about it, but they're still going to come back and talk [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=130.72s)]
*  with President Trump and all those kind of things. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=134.64s)]
*  But the important point is they made real progress and have a framework to get to a [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=137.02s)]
*  deal. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=142.46s)]
*  Besson said in Geneva, details of what the White House called a deal will be released [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=146.62s)]
*  tomorrow. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=150.70000000000002s)]
*  Officials said it's likely to follow the model of the U.S.-U.K. trade agreement, which reduced [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  tariffs on aluminum, steel and cars. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=155.9s)]
*  As I mentioned, there's some other negotiations going on today. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=158.4s)]
*  Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is in neighboring Oman meeting with Iranian officials [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=161.16000000000003s)]
*  over its nuclear program. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=165.68s)]
*  Both sides touted progress and said they will meet again. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=167.4s)]
*  They've already met four times. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=170.14000000000001s)]
*  Now, some good news, Tom. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=171.76000000000002s)]
*  Hamas said late today would release the last living American hostage held in Gaza, 21-year-old [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=173.36s)]
*  Edan Alexander from New Jersey, who served in the Israeli military. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=179.8s)]
*  Israel says there will be no ceasefire during the exchange. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=184.28s)]
*  And Hamas said that release is scheduled for Tuesday. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=187.4s)]
*  And of course, that's the same day President Trump arrives here in Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=189.8s)]
*  So some good news here from the region, Tom. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=194.28s)]
*  Very good news. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=197.56s)]
*  Thank you, Lucas. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=198.56s)]
*  OK, let's do some analysis. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=199.56s)]
*  But Molly, maybe get your take on that news. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=202.08s)]
*  The last living hostage is being released. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=204.56s)]
*  That would be remarkable. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=208.48s)]
*  And I really, truly, deeply hope that that is true. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=209.88s)]
*  Witkoff is expected to go to Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=213.0s)]
*  We hope that Edan Alexander, he's now 21. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=214.88s)]
*  He was 19 when he was taken hostage, the last living American hostage in Hamas' captivity. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=217.2s)]
*  And hopefully that does come to pass. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, big things. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson there at the end of his report said some good news. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=226.48s)]
*  And I think that is the case. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=229.64s)]
*  For the last couple days, the Trump administration on war and peace, on diplomacy, on the economy, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=231.23999999999998s)]
*  teasing ahead to potentially some big headlines to come on trade on Monday. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=236.48s)]
*  Fascinating. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=239.88s)]
*  But we definitely hope that Alexander comes home. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=240.88s)]
*  Yeah, let's get your take on some of this. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=244.32s)]
*  We got some video here. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=246.84s)]
*  Let's do the clip of Howard Lutnick on the China negotiations. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=247.88s)]
*  This is just a China problem right now, right? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=253.48s)]
*  We have 145 percent tariff. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=256.52s)]
*  They have 125 percent tariff. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=258.52s)]
*  Those tariffs are too high to do business. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=260.56s)]
*  But that's why they're talking right now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=262.59999999999997s)]
*  The rest of the world is 10 percent. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=265.12s)]
*  He's there to see if we can reset the conversation. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=267.0s)]
*  And he's at it right now. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=270.32s)]
*  But that's the objective, to de-escalate. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=271.8s)]
*  OK, Lydia, let's get your take on this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=275.24s)]
*  What are they going to be talking about on Fox Business, about these negotiations? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=277.15999999999997s)]
*  They're giving the good news. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=280.12s)]
*  They're saying it's the beginning of a deal. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=281.28000000000003s)]
*  But how much of the deal is it? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's what we're all waiting to see. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=285.2s)]
*  I mean, I think you might hear some surprise, you know, if we really have the framework [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=287.24s)]
*  of a deal and a deal actually penned, penciled, signed on the dotted line by tomorrow. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=291.6s)]
*  That's very fast, I think faster than what a lot of people are expecting. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=296.36s)]
*  I'm not sure that anyone really expected that China would be among the first. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=299.52s)]
*  You know, we had the deal with the UK just last week. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=303.0s)]
*  Now we're having China with just a second. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=306.48s)]
*  I think you can probably expect there to be a reduction in tariffs. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=308.36s)]
*  You know, the president Trump alluded to that. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=312.56s)]
*  The other questions remain, though, what are we going to see in terms of the non-tariff [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=314.88s)]
*  barriers? You know, we import three times as much from China than what they import from us. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=318.92s)]
*  We want more access to their market just as much as they want access to ours. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=325.0s)]
*  And there are things that China has done that has made them not such great and fair [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=328.96s)]
*  players with this, you know, currency manipulation, their use of labor to make their [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=332.68s)]
*  products so much cheaper. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=336.4s)]
*  I think there are a lot of questions about whether or not they're going to respect [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=337.44s)]
*  intellectual property moving forward with American firms that are doing business over there. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=339.96s)]
*  So there are a lot of details to be ironed out. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=345.08s)]
*  I thought it was very interesting that our Treasury Secretary, Scott Besson, who is very [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=346.96s)]
*  smart in the negotiation, kind of said, you know, we've made great progress. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=350.59999999999997s)]
*  He did not say that there's a deal. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=354.56s)]
*  You know, other people are talking about it as if there's already a deal across the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=356.2s)]
*  finish line. So we'll see exactly how this develops. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=358.96s)]
*  He's kind of trying to. This is what they do. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=360.84s)]
*  Trump kind of comes out with the good news and then Besson backs off it a little bit. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=363.12s)]
*  That's kind of the pattern, isn't it? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=366.76s)]
*  I think our secretary, our Treasury Secretary is very smart and respectful of the president [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=368.03999999999996s)]
*  and knows that there's not really a deal until the president says there's a deal. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=371.92s)]
*  So we'll wait and see what happens. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=374.52s)]
*  David wants to get in on China, but I'm going to throw something into the mix here, David. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=375.71999999999997s)]
*  Throw it all together. The the Iran news. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=379.24s)]
*  Let's get Representative Jared Moskovitz on the Iran nuclear talks. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=381.28s)]
*  President Trump has the capability. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=387.48s)]
*  We've seen it many times before. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=389.52s)]
*  Right now, to put maximum pressure on Iran, use that tough language and see if we can [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=390.76s)]
*  get the dismantling of those nuclear facilities. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=395.12s)]
*  If not, I'd like to see President Trump say that he will dismantle it one way or another. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=397.48s)]
*  Let the Iranians know, again, all options are on the table. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=403.2s)]
*  OK, David, let's get in on the Iran talks. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=407.24s)]
*  They're actually all tied together. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=410.04s)]
*  And if you think about even the time difference right now, it's nighttime where Scott and [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=412.36s)]
*  the trade rep are. So whatever has been done has been done already unless they're working [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=417.76s)]
*  up past midnight. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=422.12s)]
*  Iran, China, China, the deal with us. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=423.84000000000003s)]
*  China is the big player in the Middle East. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=427.4s)]
*  They buy their oil from Iran. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=429.36s)]
*  They have a lot of power in the Middle East. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=431.56s)]
*  If you think about it, their military equipment was even used in the Pakistani attack in India. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=435.2s)]
*  At the center of a lot of this is Chinese, Chinese goods, Chinese cheap goods. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=440.44s)]
*  And this deficit has to be dealt with because China gets the benefit and the world [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=446.84000000000003s)]
*  gets the deficit, frankly, to put it in those terms. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=452.0s)]
*  We have got to get China back on track as best we can. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=455.56s)]
*  And Trump uses one thing which we haven't seen played yet to the point of whether [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=459.0s)]
*  Besant is correcting or cleaning up. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=463.16s)]
*  He's really not. It's Trump's way of operating because Trump has told him before. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=464.92s)]
*  And we've seen this. I'll go back to the table. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=469.24s)]
*  And in the case of UK, got another billion dollars on the table. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=471.36s)]
*  In the end, he is the president. He will make the decision. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=474.84s)]
*  So they're working as a one to punch. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=477.68s)]
*  And with China at the middle of this, and think about the Swiss, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=480.12s)]
*  they have an embassy with Iran. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=484.03999999999996s)]
*  They're a lynchpin to that. They, China. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=485.88s)]
*  There's a reason we're there. It's not just because that's the place to do the deal. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=488.32s)]
*  It's where there are multiple people that can be involved and a lot of signals to be sent. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=493.24s)]
*  Yeah. Molly, what do you think is going to be... [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=497.15999999999997s)]
*  There's so much news today, right? I know. I know. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=498.56s)]
*  What do you think is going to be Monday's number one thing that the White House is pushing? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=500.4s)]
*  I think they're pushing whatever it is that they've got on the table for China. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=503.96s)]
*  They're kind of teasing that ahead and saying, we're going to have the big news tomorrow. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=507.56s)]
*  And what it is, hopefully we'll find out then. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=510.2s)]
*  And as you mentioned, the best sit forward and backward, and maybe the president has some big news. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=512.0799999999999s)]
*  So I think that's the big one ahead. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=515.76s)]
*  But there's another headline here. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says he's ready to meet personally with Vladimir Putin. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=517.1999999999999s)]
*  And that's a whole other part of this. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=523.68s)]
*  And this might be the most challenging part of the diplomacy that's going on right now, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=525.6s)]
*  where we're seeing some successes potentially in Israel with the potential release of this final American that they're still holding. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=528.96s)]
*  And in China, we're seeing the economic success. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=535.84s)]
*  But the Ukraine and Russia challenge seems to still be one of the toughest ones. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=538.72s)]
*  Maybe this is where Molly is. She's forcing me to change the subject to that very thing. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=543.84s)]
*  China isn't the only adversary making news today. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=549.2800000000001s)]
*  Russian President, President Vladimir Putin is proposing direct peace talks with Ukraine this week in Turkey to try to end the three plus years of fighting. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=551.32s)]
*  President Trump posted today on Truth Social urging Ukraine to agree to this meeting immediately to end the bloodbath, [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=560.32s)]
*  seemingly backing off his demands for a 30 day ceasefire before talks could start. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=567.5600000000001s)]
*  But Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is doubling down on the calls for a ceasefire. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=572.72s)]
*  He says he will be waiting for Putin in Turkey on Thursday. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=578.6400000000001s)]
*  OK, David, I bet you have an opinion about this. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=583.7600000000001s)]
*  So Putin is saying maybe no ceasefire. He wants to start talks while the bullets are still flying. Why is that? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=588.4000000000001s)]
*  You know, with Vladimir Putin, it's beyond chess. And you're not sure. The uncertainty. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=596.8000000000001s)]
*  Russia has a lot of influence in Turkey, right down to the rail lines. The rail widths are Russian widths. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=602.4000000000001s)]
*  Their influence there is important. Also, it's a place for them to hedge against NATO, [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=608.0s)]
*  of which Turkey is a member by staying in a strong relationship with Erdogan. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=612.72s)]
*  So from that point, Putin may be willing to go and have a talk, but you can never read ahead in what he's going to do. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=618.8s)]
*  Zelensky has his own problems internally in the Ukraine. One, he's got no infrastructure of any sort. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=625.1999999999999s)]
*  You've got people who may return from the battlefield. There's not a medical infrastructure. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=631.76s)]
*  There are a lot of other social services, a government that's fractured. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=635.92s)]
*  And he's got his hard right flank that he has to figure a way to get out of this, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=639.6s)]
*  stop the bloodshed if he wants to, and find a way to keep himself out of the sights of his hard right flank in the Ukraine. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=644.3199999999999s)]
*  So going to Turkey, waiting for Putin, puts the onus on Putin, who's coming off his victory day and a good feeling in Russia, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=651.28s)]
*  and might make it more, I don't know, palpable, maybe more easy to find an off-ramp, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=659.04s)]
*  which the off-ramp's been off the table for a long time. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=664.48s)]
*  Yeah, well, Lydia, we're certainly in better shape than we were when Zelensky was, you know, [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=667.36s)]
*  having a tense meeting in the White House not long ago. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=673.6800000000001s)]
*  That's right. We've got a mineral deal signed. It seems like the relationships are patched up. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=677.12s)]
*  You know, I was just thinking that, you know, even as it stands right now, I think that the way talks are progressing [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=681.12s)]
*  is evidence that the American first policy and agenda is working. You had European leaders over the weekend [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=686.88s)]
*  gathering with Zelensky to talk about his support of him, and they're phoning it into Trump to say, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=693.1999999999999s)]
*  this is what we propose, this is how we're going to support a ceasefire, this is how we're going to support a peace brokering. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=697.8399999999999s)]
*  That is what President Trump has wanted. He's wanted European nations to step forward and take more responsibility [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=702.56s)]
*  for securing peace in their own region rather than relying on the United States to fight all of their battles. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=707.68s)]
*  That's been a priority. It's something that he's been saying needs to happen. I think we're seeing it happening in real time. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=712.64s)]
*  Yeah, Molly, it's almost, there's almost too many headlines to deal with at this point, right? [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=717.4399999999999s)]
*  There really are, and interestingly enough, Zelensky is calling Putin out directly as well. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=721.84s)]
*  He says personally, I hope this time Putin won't be looking for an excuse as to why he can't make it. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=727.0400000000001s)]
*  So we'll see. We'll see what happens. Hopefully there's some big progress there as well, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=733.6s)]
*  but there are a lot of balls up and being juggled all over the globe right now. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=737.76s)]
*  All right, coming up on a brand new hour of the big weekend show. New details revealed on the [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=742.88s)]
*  pro-Hamas thugs who stormed Columbia University's campus. But first, chaos at America's busiest [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=747.28s)]
*  airport. Details of another terrifying outage next. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMe6JGJtAb8&t=753.36s)]
