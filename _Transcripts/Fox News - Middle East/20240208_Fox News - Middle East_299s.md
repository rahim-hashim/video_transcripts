# US strike kills Iran-backed Hezbollah commander
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 08, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k)
*  A drone strike in Iraq has killed a high ranking militia leader with connections to the attack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=0.0s)]
*  on the US base that killed three service members in Jordan. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=6.26s)]
*  Florida Congressman Mike Walt joins us now. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=9.44s)]
*  Congressman, good morning to you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=11.6s)]
*  What do you think about this strike and where we are in our fight against Iran? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Well, I'm glad to see the strike happen. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=18.0s)]
*  I wish this strike had happened some time ago, somewhere in between the dozens and dozens [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=22.56s)]
*  of attacks on our forces. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=29.04s)]
*  But again, it is still coming from a flawed approach from the administration that we can [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=31.24s)]
*  strike the militias in Iraq and not Iranian assets in Iraq. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=38.6s)]
*  We are still not going after the IRGC operatives and commanders who resource these militias. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=45.34s)]
*  They train them. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=53.3s)]
*  They operate alongside with them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=54.519999999999996s)]
*  They guide them. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=56.56s)]
*  They advise them. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=57.74s)]
*  Those are the ones that we have to be taking down, including Soleimani's successor, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=59.38s)]
*  Kani, is the leader of the Quds Force, the IRGC Quds Force. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=65.14s)]
*  He is operating all over the Middle East doing what Soleimani did in orchestrating all of [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=71.76s)]
*  these attacks. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=77.34s)]
*  Those are the things, those are the operatives that Iran cares about, and that's what will [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=79.08s)]
*  restore deterrence. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=82.9s)]
*  Taking out the expendable militias, Iran will trade them all day long for American casualties. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=84.66s)]
*  I just don't think it's going to work. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=91.17999999999999s)]
*  To that point, Congressman, you focused on the who. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=93.22s)]
*  I want to focus on the when. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=95.3s)]
*  If we know who these people are, whether they're the individuals you're speaking about or [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=97.58s)]
*  the individuals we killed, why don't we go after them before they kill Americans? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=101.78s)]
*  Well, ostensibly, this commander was plotting even more attacks on the United States. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=108.5s)]
*  But yeah, that's my point. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=115.62s)]
*  We should have done this a long time ago before they launched all of these attacks. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=117.02000000000001s)]
*  But at the end of the day, guys, Iran doesn't care about these militias or even their senior [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=122.74000000000001s)]
*  commanders. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=130.54000000000002s)]
*  Now, it may degrade their ability to attack us again for a while, but at the end of the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=131.54000000000002s)]
*  restore some semblance of deterrence, you have to go after things Iran cares about. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=136.46s)]
*  And Iran cares about its intelligence operatives and its IRGC commanders, not these Iraqi militias [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=141.86s)]
*  or Yemeni militias or even the Hezbollah operatives that Israel is attacking. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=150.62s)]
*  That's not what's going to stop Iran. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=158.18s)]
*  And then secondarily, we passed a bill in the House of Representatives that would put [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=160.5s)]
*  secondary sanctions on the Chinese buyers, shippers, refineries that are buying Iranian [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=165.06s)]
*  oil. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=172.94s)]
*  We have to dry up the cash or ultimately they're going to continue not only to flood it towards [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=174.02s)]
*  these terrorist groups, they're sending weapons, missiles, drones into Russia as well. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=179.5s)]
*  So we're fighting against ourselves on all fronts. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=186.74s)]
*  Well, Congressman, on that exact topic, we're just learning that Chinese President Xi Jinping [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=189.77999999999997s)]
*  and Vladimir Putin had a phone call today. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=194.89999999999998s)]
*  No details on what they spoke about have been released just yet. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=198.45999999999998s)]
*  But this is another example of our enemies becoming closer and closer with each passing [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=203.01999999999998s)]
*  month. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=209.5s)]
*  What's your reaction to that, this phone call that just took place? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=210.5s)]
*  Well, this is the No Limits Partnership that we should be incredibly concerned about. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=214.9s)]
*  If you'll remember, when Xi went and met Putin personally, he stated, and I think this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=221.62s)]
*  was for us and the whole world to hear, that this is Xi to Putin, this is a once-in-a-generation [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=227.26000000000002s)]
*  opportunity to turn the current world order, led by Western democracies in the United States, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=233.70000000000002s)]
*  upside down. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=239.82000000000002s)]
*  And I think they met during this Biden administration. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=241.62s)]
*  And it is no surprise that all of our adversaries are on the march. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=245.72s)]
*  And if you just look at the Middle East, you have China buying Iranian oil. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=250.35999999999999s)]
*  Iran is flush with cash. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=255.4s)]
*  Iran floods that cash into its terrorist proxies, attacking us and Israel, and then is sending [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=257.44s)]
*  weapons right into support Russia. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=263.65999999999997s)]
*  So we have to break that cycle and drive wedges between this axis of evil. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=267.35999999999996s)]
*  And I just don't see a strategy from this administration to do that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=274.03999999999996s)]
*  Congressman Mike Waltz, amazing insight. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=277.71999999999997s)]
*  We've got to wake up because we have real threats and it seems like we dance around [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=281.12s)]
*  the real issues. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=284.55999999999995s)]
*  We got to solve them. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=285.88s)]
*  Congressman, thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=286.88s)]
*  Congressman, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bokYYCCSJ1k&t=287.88s)]
