# It might take a catastrophe for this to change: Rep. Waltz
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk)
*  We've got this about a month now for the past seven days. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=0.0s)]
*  Plus, Smoothy rebels attacking several commercial ships [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=4.24s)]
*  in the US destroyer in the Red Sea using drones [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=7.74s)]
*  and ballistic missiles. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=10.56s)]
*  You ask yourself, what will be done in return? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  So far, the Biden administration holding back [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=13.68s)]
*  and retaliating against the Iranian-backed group. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=16.42s)]
*  Republican Congressman Michael Waltz [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  sits on several committees with us now, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=21.42s)]
*  former Green Bay Beret commander. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  How you doing, sir? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=25.1s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=25.94s)]
*  A couple ways to look at this. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=26.76s)]
*  They can't see, Bill. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there's a thought that the Houthis [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=29.2s)]
*  could do a peace deal with the government in Yemen [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=31.4s)]
*  that's backed by Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=33.8s)]
*  In the meantime, you've got Iran that's [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=35.68s)]
*  backing these Houthi rebels. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=37.36s)]
*  Do you believe this administration is [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=39.6s)]
*  concerned with upsetting Iran that may spoil some sort [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=41.6s)]
*  of deal down the road that's still hopeful for it? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=45.28s)]
*  They are. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=47.44s)]
*  Well, yeah, Bill, and I would point out [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=50.0s)]
*  that the Biden administration delisted the Houthi rebels [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=51.72s)]
*  as a terrorist organization. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=56.6s)]
*  It's first month in office. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=58.16s)]
*  And that was part and parcel to what concessions [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=60.0s)]
*  could we make to Iran on this fantasy [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=63.0s)]
*  that we could re-enter a JCPOA or Iran deal. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=66.24s)]
*  The other thing I would point out is, look, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  the rockets that Hamas is firing out of Gaza [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=71.44s)]
*  are relatively dumb, unsophisticated, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  and easy to manufacture and light off. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=78.6s)]
*  These anti-ship cruise missiles, it [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=82.08s)]
*  requires intelligence to know what ship is coming [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=84.72s)]
*  through the strait into the Red Sea, targeting. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=88.36s)]
*  And they're not easy to fire and use effectively. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=91.8s)]
*  So this is absolutely Iranian-resourced, trained, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=95.28s)]
*  provided, and directed, 100%. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=99.56s)]
*  And the Navy calls this environment [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=103.08s)]
*  the archer in the arrow. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=106.52s)]
*  And right now, our ships are authorized [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=108.6s)]
*  to shoot down the arrow, the missile, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=111.44s)]
*  but they are not authorized. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=113.96s)]
*  And this is bad policy coming out [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=115.64s)]
*  of the Pentagon and the White House to go after the archer, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=117.64s)]
*  which are the Houthis and the radars that [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=120.72s)]
*  are shooting these things, much less to go back to Iran [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=122.8s)]
*  and actually impose costs on Iran itself. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=126.72s)]
*  At the end of the day, as long as Iran is flush with caste [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=129.92s)]
*  and they're unmolested, unfettered, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=132.24s)]
*  and we're not imposing costs on Iran itself, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=134.68s)]
*  this is all going to continue. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  I don't know what it's going to take, Bill, us losing a ship [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=138.56s)]
*  or some type of truly catastrophic attack. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=141.68s)]
*  Or the White House changes policy. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  To emphasize your point, here's Admiral Kirby [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=146.84s)]
*  on part of what you just said. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=149.44s)]
*  These attacks represent a direct threat [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=152.16s)]
*  to international commerce and to freedom of navigation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=154.16s)]
*  They've jeopardized the lives of merchant sailors [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  that represent multiple countries all around the world. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=159.8s)]
*  And while they are launched by the Houthis, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=163.36s)]
*  we certainly have every reason to believe [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=166.24s)]
*  that they're being enabled by Iran. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=167.88s)]
*  As the National Security Advisor said just the other day, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=171.0s)]
*  the Houthis are pulling the trigger. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=173.0s)]
*  Iran is providing the guns. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=174.88s)]
*  Okay, so I gave you a couple theories. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=176.52s)]
*  What's yours as to why there is no response? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=179.24s)]
*  Well, at the end of the day, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=186.48s)]
*  I think there is still this fantasy and hope [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=188.08s)]
*  that they could enter into a deal in Iran's nuclear program. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=191.08s)]
*  There's no other explanation for why you would go [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=194.08s)]
*  to the podium, tell the world that Iran is behind this, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=196.84s)]
*  they're doing this, and eventually, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=200.0s)]
*  they're going to get through [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=201.79999999999998s)]
*  and then not change policy on Iran. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=203.04s)]
*  They have to go back to maximum pressure, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=206.04s)]
*  you have to dry up the coffers, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=207.76s)]
*  you have to put the regime on its back foot. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=209.48s)]
*  Right now, when you hear from the administration, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=212.28s)]
*  de-escalation, de-escalation, what Iran hears from that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=214.92s)]
*  is opportunity and space to continue to push. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=219.12s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=222.88s)]
*  Michael Waltz, we'll talk again soon. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gi4kxu98_kk&t=223.72s)]
