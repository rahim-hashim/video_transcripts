# Gabbard: Iran war would make Iraq conflict 'look like a picnic'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs)
*  Here now exclusively, Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a 2020 Democratic presidential [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=0.0s)]
*  candidate, combat veteran, and major in the Army National Guard. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  She is campaigning tonight in New Hampshire. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Thank you very much, Congresswoman Gabbard. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=13.5s)]
*  Good to have you here tonight. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=14.82s)]
*  Thank you, Martha. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=16.96s)]
*  Appreciate the opportunity. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=17.96s)]
*  So, obviously, you think this is heading in a very bad direction. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=18.96s)]
*  What do you think happens next? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=22.38s)]
*  Well, we've got to be clear-eyed about the situation that we are in, that inching closer, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=25.64s)]
*  actually more than inching, speeding towards an all-out war with Iran would make the wars [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=31.96s)]
*  that we've seen in Iraq and in Afghanistan look like a picnic. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=38.0s)]
*  It will be far more costly in lives, American lives, and American taxpayer dollars, and [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=42.28s)]
*  all towards accomplishing what goal, what objective. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=47.96s)]
*  I think that's really at the crux of this decision that President Trump made to take [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=51.68s)]
*  out Soleimani. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=55.44s)]
*  We've got to make sure that our commander-in-chief is making decisions that are based on the [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=56.92s)]
*  best interests of the safety and security of the American people, our own national security. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=60.68s)]
*  And that's not what's happened here. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=66.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=67.44s)]
*  So put yourself for a moment in the White House, in the Oval Office. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=68.44s)]
*  You have a situation where tankers are being hit. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=71.76s)]
*  You have a situation where an American contractor is killed. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=74.76s)]
*  And then you have the embassy that we built. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=78.68s)]
*  It is sovereign United States territory under attack. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=80.8s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=84.24s)]
*  Well, actually work to de-escalate the situation. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=85.24s)]
*  We've got to recognize that these things didn't just happen overnight. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=89.6s)]
*  These things began with Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear agreement, choosing [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=93.0s)]
*  to move away from diplomacy, further escalating tensions between the U.S. and Iran, escalating [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=98.08s)]
*  crippling sanctions, a modern-day siege against Iran, sending more and more troops to the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=103.96s)]
*  region, further escalating tensions, and designating Iran's military as a terrorist organization, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  further escalating this conflict with Iran, something that's never been done by any country [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=115.75999999999999s)]
*  anywhere in the world before. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=121.16s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=122.84s)]
*  But if you haveâ€” [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=123.84s)]
*  And this is where he has not put the national security interests of our country first. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=124.84s)]
*  I just want to finish this, because there's two main points here of how he has undermined [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=128.44s)]
*  our national security. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=132.24s)]
*  Number one, every day that goes on that Iran is not in the nuclear agreement and just, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=133.24s)]
*  I think, yesterday announced that they're no longer abiding by any restrictions that [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=138.24s)]
*  were part of that agreement. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=142.12s)]
*  That means they're closer to developing a nuclear weapon capability, putting us and [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=143.44s)]
*  the world at risk. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=147.36s)]
*  And number two, because our forces in Iraq, for example, are no longer going to be focusing [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  on defeating and ensuring that al-Qaeda and ISIS are not allowed a resurgence, our commander [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=154.60000000000002s)]
*  there yesterday just said, we're not doing that anymore because now our troops have to [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  focus on Iran, allowing ISIS and al-Qaeda to create and mount a resurgence that further [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=166.68s)]
*  puts us and our national security at risk. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=173.52s)]
*  I think there are plenty of people who agree with you, and then there are people on the [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=175.72s)]
*  other side of the equation who say when you are presented with intelligence, and members [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=179.0s)]
*  of Congress are going to hear what that intelligence was, I imagine on Wednesday, or at least a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=183.94s)]
*  little bit more information on these imminent threats, and you don't take the target of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=188.0s)]
*  to take this person out who is behind those threats to American citizens and American [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=194.24s)]
*  military, you take a risk of having people then turn back to you and say, how could you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=198.56s)]
*  have allowed our people, our military, to be made vulnerable by this attack when you [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  knew you had the opportunity to take this guy out? [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  And I want you to listen for just a second to Sergeant Bartlett, who has been a frequent [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=214.36s)]
*  guest on this program. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=217.88s)]
*  And he talked to us the other night about the IED that was Iranian made that blew him [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=220.16s)]
*  up and changed his life and took away his friends. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=227.2s)]
*  It's retribution for guys like this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=228.2s)]
*  Sergeant First Class Brian Mancini, dead at the hands of an Iranian, passed his injuries. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=232.48s)]
*  Sergeant William J. Brooks, Corporal Bishop, Robert Sedum, all these guys are their friends, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=237.96s)]
*  you know, have died at the hands of the Iranians in this current regime and some to the Quds [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=245.96s)]
*  Force and Soleimani at his hands. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=250.96s)]
*  So for us, it's retribution. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=254.84s)]
*  So given the opportunity to take him out and prevent further attacks against men and women [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=258.40000000000003s)]
*  like that, how do you not take it? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=263.0s)]
*  Look, Martha, I'm the only candidate running for president who's actually served in uniform [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=265.8s)]
*  in Iraq during the height of the war. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=273.0s)]
*  I understand very clearly both what happened and the situation, the challenges that we [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=275.36s)]
*  are dealing with there now. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=280.24s)]
*  But here's the key that as commander in chief, the commander in chief should not be making [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=282.08s)]
*  decisions based on who is a bad guy or even who has blood on their hands. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=286.48s)]
*  The commander in chief needs to make a decision about what is in the best national security [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=291.16s)]
*  interests of our country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=295.28000000000003s)]
*  And I just gave you the two biggest examples of how Trump's decision has undermined our [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=297.2s)]
*  national security and made the American people less safe. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=302.28s)]
*  That is at the crux of what is wrong with the decision that Donald Trump made and why [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=306.55999999999995s)]
*  it's so critical that we have a commander in chief who has experience and understanding [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  in both foreign policy and our national security to make and with the foresight to see what [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=316.11999999999995s)]
*  the consequences of those decisions will be. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=321.59999999999997s)]
*  This is why I'm running for president to bring the experience that I have to fulfill that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  responsibility and to serve as commander in chief. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=328.53999999999996s)]
*  Everybody respects your service and your ability to discuss it from your own perspective, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=331.36s)]
*  from your experiences there as well. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=336.52s)]
*  I just want to play this. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=338.52s)]
*  This is a soundbite from the Hezbollah leader Nasrallah threatening Americans and warning [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=339.52s)]
*  U.S. forces. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=344.84s)]
*  When the American soldiers and officers' coffins start moving to the United States, as they [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=348.44s)]
*  came vertically, they will go back horizontally. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=352.88s)]
*  Then Trump and his administration will recognize that they really lost the region and they [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=355.8s)]
*  will lose the election. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=361.04s)]
*  Interpret that threat for us. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=363.04s)]
*  In practical terms, what do you expect to happen now? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=365.04s)]
*  Look, it's hard to say with specifics, but I think that this statement is further affirmation [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=369.32s)]
*  of how this step that Trump took is a serious escalation of this war that further puts the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=375.38s)]
*  American people and our troops in the region at risk. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=384.92s)]
*  This is why I am calling for our troops to get out of Iraq and Syria now. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=389.04s)]
*  Because the longer that they stay there, the more likely it is that we will find ourselves [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=394.04s)]
*  entrenched into another endless quagmire of a war with no one able to define what does [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=398.8s)]
*  winning look like, what does victory look like, what are we actually trying to accomplish, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=406.04s)]
*  and how does it actually serve the best interests of our people and of our safety and security. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  Congresswoman Gabbard, thank you very much. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  Good to speak with you tonight. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=418.15999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for being here. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=419.15999999999997s)]
*  Thank you, Martha. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3slX5p3YAs&t=420.15999999999997s)]
