# Biden has to get this crisis under control: GOP rep
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE)
*  Now for more on the migrant crisis, we're joined now by a Republican congressman from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=0.0s)]
*  Texas, Tony Gonzalez. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=4.4s)]
*  Tony, obviously you heard Matt, he's watching it there in Sunland. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=6.08s)]
*  El Paso is a busy sector. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=10.08s)]
*  But you don't have, and I've been to Mt. Cristo and covered that area, you don't have really [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=12.72s)]
*  much of the efforts that Texas and DPS has tried to harden that area because of the topography [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=18.44s)]
*  is very difficult. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=27.400000000000002s)]
*  In other parts down in El Paso, they are putting up the Constitucional wire. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=28.72s)]
*  They are trying to replicate efforts like they've done in Eagle Pass, which is an area [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=33.12s)]
*  you represent. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=40.08s)]
*  Griff, thank you for having me on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=41.08s)]
*  Every part of the border is different. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=44.28s)]
*  What I am seeing, I represent two thirds of the Texas-Mexico border. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=46.04s)]
*  I've seen this crisis spread. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=49.72s)]
*  We started talking about it in Texas and then we started talking about it in Arizona and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=51.92s)]
*  now we're talking about it in New Mexico. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=56.04s)]
*  There is no end to this. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=58.04s)]
*  Essentially, Americans are less safe than we were four years ago and it starts at the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=59.72s)]
*  top. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=64.4s)]
*  It starts with Biden, it starts with Harris and it starts with Mayorkas. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=65.4s)]
*  We were safe under President Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=69.16s)]
*  The people in my district, we just want to be safe again. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=71.24s)]
*  I don't think that's a unique situation. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=74.32s)]
*  I think across the country, people want to be safe. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=76.32s)]
*  I was just in Del Rio two days ago. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=78.68s)]
*  I was visiting the port of entry with the port director there. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=80.84s)]
*  I was there, there were 20 or so folks that had come over illegally. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=85.36s)]
*  They came up and this is what one of the persons said. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=88.04s)]
*  They said, I was told to come here for a better life. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=90.4s)]
*  Oh, I get that, but that does not mean you qualify for asylum. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=93.24s)]
*  That person or anybody else in that situation should immediately be deported. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=98.12s)]
*  That is not what is occurring. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=102.86s)]
*  That's what President Biden needs to do to get this under control. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=104.76s)]
*  Otherwise it's just going to continue to spread. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=107.88s)]
*  That's why we see Governor Abbott in your state of Texas continuing to fight now in [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=110.32s)]
*  the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans for the enactment and constitutionality [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=116.83999999999999s)]
*  of SB 4, the Texas law that would allow, make it a crime to legally cross and allow your [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=121.28s)]
*  Texas law enforcement to essentially enforce what the border patrol does and arrest people [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=127.32s)]
*  for illegally crossing and ultimately remove them. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=133.24s)]
*  I want to just show you something, Tony. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=136.0s)]
*  On Friday, I had a roundtable with reporters and he basically said what Texas is doing [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=139.83999999999997s)]
*  isn't having an effect. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=145.23999999999998s)]
*  Here's a quote from it. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=146.64s)]
*  He said, we do not consider Constantine a wire to be effective. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=147.64s)]
*  It impairs customs and border protections ability to do its job. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=150.83999999999997s)]
*  And we're also seeing migrants rather easily cutting Constantine a wire. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=154.44s)]
*  Well, we know they're cutting the Obama wall as Matt Finn just showed us, but I want to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=158.39999999999998s)]
*  ask you, what do you make of that statement? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=163.56s)]
*  It tells me that he's given up on the situation and you should never have a secretary give [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=167.48s)]
*  up on Americans' safety. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  And it tells me that Governor Abbott is doing everything he possibly can to keep Texans [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=174.95999999999998s)]
*  and Americans safe. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=179.76s)]
*  And we're grateful for it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=180.83999999999997s)]
*  We're throwing everything we can at the kitchen table, the kitchen sink, other than the kitchen [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=183.07999999999998s)]
*  sink in order to make sure we're safe. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  But this ends, it's very simple, Griffin, you know this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  the federal government, our Border Patrol agents, deport these people that are breaking [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=193.8s)]
*  the law. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  And that is exactly what's happening. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=200.72s)]
*  I get it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=202.0s)]
*  You're fleeing desperate situations. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=203.0s)]
*  But the bottom line is we do not know who you are. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=204.68s)]
*  We don't know if you're a Venezuelan gang member. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=207.4s)]
*  We don't know if you're an impoverished woman traveling from Guatemala. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=209.86s)]
*  And it's just unsafe to Americans. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=214.04000000000002s)]
*  So my hat goes off to the governor for everything he's doing. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=215.92000000000002s)]
*  We need to do more though. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=219.44s)]
*  The people in my district, the people along the border, we want solutions today. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=220.72s)]
*  We want our lives back. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=224.66s)]
*  Tony, I want to shift gears before we run out of time here because you are a member [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=225.92s)]
*  of Congress and we are seeing what seems to be at best some ambiguity on whether or not [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=231.07999999999998s)]
*  this administration is getting soft in their support of Israel. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=237.76s)]
*  Just today we're reading in Axios, I can show you this headline. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=243.52s)]
*  Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi joining a call to halt U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=248.56s)]
*  She signed on to a progressive Democrat letter calling for such and she is one of the long [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=254.92000000000002s)]
*  standing supporters of Israel. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=261.36s)]
*  Now is there a shift going on in the Democrat party in terms of its firm support of Israel [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=263.12s)]
*  in the wake of the World Central Kitchen incident? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=269.04s)]
*  There is and it worries me because now is not the time to waver on supporting Israel [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=273.28s)]
*  when they're in the middle of this conflict. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=278.24s)]
*  And I've been a strong proponent of this war ends when Hamas is eradicated and people in [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=280.04s)]
*  Israel will never forget October 7th, but it seems as if the Democratic party is forgetting [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=286.4s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=292.24s)]
*  So October 7th has to be in everybody's mind and we have to make sure that Israelis can [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=294.56s)]
*  wake up in their own beds and be safe because they're our allies. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=298.6s)]
*  Because guess what? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=302.82s)]
*  That terrorism that starts abroad doesn't end there if we don't stop it where it roots out. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=304.82s)]
*  So I think now is a very important time in history for members of Congress to stand up. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=308.82s)]
*  They always talk about being strong with Israel. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=314.38s)]
*  Well now is the time to stand firm with our allies and make sure they have every tool [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=316.58s)]
*  and every resource they can to fight and win this war on their soil and ideally not on ours. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=322.18s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=328.42s)]
*  Congressman Tony Gonzalez, thank you for taking time today to join us. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=329.42s)]
*  Thanks, Drew. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PwirjJq3YDE&t=333.82s)]
