# Gen. Jack Keane: 'This is a major, major problem'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg)
*  Welcome back, America. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=0.0s)]
*  We're here with our friend, not just a general. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=2.6s)]
*  The man's a retired four-star Army general. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=6.5s)]
*  That's a big deal. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=8.8s)]
*  Jack Keane and Institute for the Study of War. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=9.6s)]
*  He's the chairman, nobody better. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=13.8s)]
*  General Keane. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=16.4s)]
*  Israel is surrounded on all sides and has the Mediterranean Sea [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  on the one side where it's not surrounded. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=23.2s)]
*  It's under attack on all sides. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=25.5s)]
*  Hamas to the south, Hezbollah to the north, the PLO to the east. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=28.2s)]
*  They're all being backed by Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=33.1s)]
*  And I'm sitting here in amazement. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=34.9s)]
*  Do you think Israel's gaining the kind of at least public support [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=36.7s)]
*  from the president, the vice president, the secretary of state, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=40.7s)]
*  the secretary of defense that an ally should be receiving [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=43.5s)]
*  that is taking all this incoming and taking on it appears Iran [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=46.9s)]
*  and its surrogates almost by itself? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=50.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's pretty outrageous. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=52.9s)]
*  I mean, what Israel has done here quite successfully in rather [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=54.300000000000004s)]
*  rapid fashion, killing Mohammed Deif, the military commander [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=59.6s)]
*  of Hamas and also Fuad Sikora, a military commander obviously [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=64.9s)]
*  of Hezbollah and now the chief political negotiator [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=71.9s)]
*  and political spokesperson for Hamas, Hanayeah. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=76.7s)]
*  And the fact that they've accomplished this [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=81.30000000000001s)]
*  and the administration reacts to this, Mark, by wringing their hands [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=84.0s)]
*  and their number one concern is about escalation, which in of itself [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=88.2s)]
*  shows a sign of weakness. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=94.3s)]
*  And this has been the problem, you know, from the outset is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=96.4s)]
*  that the horrific attack on October the 7th, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=100.8s)]
*  Iran operationalized immediately all of the other proxies. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=104.4s)]
*  On October the 8th, Hezbollah began to fire in northern Israel. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=109.2s)]
*  The Iranian-backed Shia militias in Iraq and Syria, prior to October the 7th, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=115.0s)]
*  had already fired at U.S. troops 125 times and they stepped it up [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=120.2s)]
*  from October the 7th on and the Houthis have effectively shut down [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  the Suez Canal. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=131.4s)]
*  And yet, to this day, we still do not hold Iran accountable [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=133.0s)]
*  for anything that I just said. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=138.0s)]
*  And it's absolutely tragic and it's a huge strategic mistake. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=140.1s)]
*  And as a result of it, you're very right to point out [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=144.3s)]
*  it puts Israel on its own in a sense in having to do some of the work. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=147.6s)]
*  This killing of leaders is sending a clear message to the Iranians [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=153.0s)]
*  that we are determined. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=158.2s)]
*  We're staying in this fight to the end. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=159.9s)]
*  We're going to stay here until we achieve victory. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=162.2s)]
*  And leaders, your operational leaders and leaders in Iran are at risk [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=164.9s)]
*  as long as you're continuing this axis of resistance [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=169.6s)]
*  and the ring of fire around Israel. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=172.9s)]
*  And yes, I agree with you. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=175.5s)]
*  Despite the rhetoric of ironclad support that you get for the administration, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=177.4s)]
*  the actions that you get undermine the state of Israel [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  and what they're trying to accomplish. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=185.1s)]
*  You know, General, I've never seen anything like this. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=186.8s)]
*  You are more attuned to this, more focused on this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=189.1s)]
*  This has been your whole life, your whole career. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=192.1s)]
*  I have a list of weapons systems and ammunition and so forth [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=195.2s)]
*  that are being slow-walked to the Israelis, even now, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=198.8s)]
*  that are being withheld from the Israelis, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=202.1s)]
*  even though Congress has approved the funding and delivery of these things. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=204.1s)]
*  At the same time, tens of billions of dollars have flowed into Iran [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=208.9s)]
*  directly and indirectly from our country, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=212.2s)]
*  lack of enforcement of the oil embargo and so forth. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=214.1s)]
*  So Iran is muscling up. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=217.8s)]
*  They're helping to provide support to China, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=220.0s)]
*  which is providing support to Russia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=225.1s)]
*  All three are providing support to the terror states in Iran and the Middle East. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=227.8s)]
*  Is this not insane? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=232.7s)]
*  I mean, I'm watching this now, and I'm saying to myself, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=234.5s)]
*  why are we funding the enemy, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=238.0s)]
*  and why do we have our foot on the throat of our ally? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=240.2s)]
*  Am I missing something here? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=243.5s)]
*  No, you're not missing it at all. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=245.0s)]
*  I mean, this is a major, major problem. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=246.5s)]
*  I've been on a congressional commission for 18 months [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=250.1s)]
*  looking at our defense strategy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=253.0s)]
*  This is bipartisan. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=255.1s)]
*  Our unanimous report just came out, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=256.3s)]
*  and we are saying to the American people through the Congress who we're reporting to, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=258.8s)]
*  is that we are facing the most serious and dangerous challenges [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=263.3s)]
*  as a nation that we have faced since World War II [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=267.2s)]
*  because of China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea all cooperating together, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=270.2s)]
*  and there's been an erosion of our military capability, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=276.0s)]
*  but fundamentally there's been an erosion of our will. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=279.0s)]
*  And our adversaries know it. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=282.4s)]
*  They see opportunity, and they are exploiting our vulnerabilities. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=284.7s)]
*  And you name the country, Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=288.5s)]
*  and we all have vivid examples of what they're doing. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=292.7s)]
*  We're at war in two areas right now supporting allies, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=295.6s)]
*  and President Xi is threatening war in the third. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=300.0s)]
*  And one of the major problems we find with this [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=303.7s)]
*  is we could face a war in the Indo-Pacific region, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=306.4s)]
*  and then war would break out also in Europe and also in the Middle East [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=310.09999999999997s)]
*  that would have to involve us. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=314.9s)]
*  And that's why we think it's the most dangerous threat since World War II. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=317.0s)]
*  And this administration, Mark, will not talk about this issue [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=320.9s)]
*  with the American people. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=325.2s)]
*  And they won't fund our military adequately. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=326.7s)]
*  When we come back, General, here's my question. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=329.0s)]
*  Is this administration provoking war by the way it is not supporting our military, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=331.0s)]
*  by the way it is not properly supporting our allies, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=338.29999999999995s)]
*  and by the public comments they make or their silence, conversely? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=341.29999999999995s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_7UGI_91zg&t=346.09999999999997s)]
