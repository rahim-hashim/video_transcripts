# Watters: Iran is up against the clock
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k)
*  Fox News alert, the Ayatollah has gone into hiding. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=0.0s)]
*  He's believed to be holed up inside an underground bunker northeast of the capital. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=3.72s)]
*  This is a different kind of Iranian hostage crisis. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=8.32s)]
*  Khomeini can hide, but he can't run. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=11.24s)]
*  For the past 24 hours, Israel's been attacking the area around his underground lair. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=14.06s)]
*  But Khomeini, still talking tough, says Iran will not surrender to anyone. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=19.3s)]
*  Khomeini is warning that if America joins the fight and strikes, it'll result in irreparable [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=25.52s)]
*  damage to the United States. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=30.42s)]
*  Is he bluffing? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=32.62s)]
*  We don't know. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=33.94s)]
*  Iranian proxies, which have been severely degraded, are threatening to commit acts of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=35.1s)]
*  terror against American troops and American ships in the region. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=39.8s)]
*  And American businesses are now bracing for cyber attacks. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=44.4s)]
*  Trump says, good luck with that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=47.96s)]
*  We won't be bullied. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=50.06s)]
*  I was the hunted. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=52.28s)]
*  And now I'm the hunter. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=54.28s)]
*  It's a big difference. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=55.28s)]
*  That means I've had it. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=57.04s)]
*  Okay, I've had it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=58.04s)]
*  I give up. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=59.04s)]
*  I'm no more. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=60.04s)]
*  Then we go blow up all the nuclear stuff that's all over the place there. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  Now, they had bad intentions. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=66.24000000000001s)]
*  You know, for 40 years, they've been saying death to America, death to Israel, death to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=68.36s)]
*  anybody else that they didn't like. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=73.2s)]
*  They were bullies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=75.32000000000001s)]
*  They were schoolyard bullies. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=78.12s)]
*  And now they're not bullies anymore. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=81.16s)]
*  Trump's been meeting in the Situation Room with his national security team. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=83.08s)]
*  Head of Central Command, Army General Eric Carrillo, they call him the Gorilla, has been [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=86.64s)]
*  instrumental in the war planning. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=91.8s)]
*  The Pentagon's sending in their new state-of-the-art supercarrier, the USS Gerald Ford, and amassing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=94.0s)]
*  a tremendous amount of assets in the area. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=100.32s)]
*  Today, Trump had lunch with Pakistan's army chief. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=103.0s)]
*  Pakistan borders Iran. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=107.24s)]
*  Seems like something's about to happen. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=108.84s)]
*  Trump's not showing his cards yet. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=111.28s)]
*  Whether you are moving closer or you believe the U.S. is moving closer to striking Iranian [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  nuclear facilities, where's your mindset on that? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=120.36s)]
*  I can't say that, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=122.36s)]
*  You don't seriously think I'm going to answer that question. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=123.36s)]
*  Will you strike the Iranian nuclear component? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=126.84s)]
*  And what time exactly, sir? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=130.56s)]
*  Sir, would you strike it? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=132.44s)]
*  Would you please inform us so we can be there and watch? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=134.44s)]
*  You don't know that I'm going to even do it. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=137.52s)]
*  You don't know. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=139.52s)]
*  I may do it. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=140.52s)]
*  I may not do it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=141.52s)]
*  I mean, nobody knows what I'm going to do. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=142.52s)]
*  And this is just breaking. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=143.52s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal is reporting Trump privately approved attack plans against Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=144.6s)]
*  Now, we don't know what these plans entail, but we're told they include U.S. airstrikes. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Unsure if that includes bunker busters. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=155.52s)]
*  Remember, the latest version of the bunker buster has never been used on the battlefield. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=157.64000000000001s)]
*  It's only been tested. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=163.44s)]
*  Axios reports that Trump has been quizzing his generals. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=165.07999999999998s)]
*  Are they sure if he uses them, they'll be 100% effective? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=168.72s)]
*  The generals say yes, but Trump's not completely convinced. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=172.88s)]
*  Caroline Levitt says all options remain on the table. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  Trump's been waiting on giving the final order, seeing if the Iranians give up and surrender [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  their new program peacefully. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=186.07999999999998s)]
*  Sources in D.C. say Trump's out of patience and Iran's up against the clock. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=188.28s)]
*  I believe that unless Iran surrenders in the next 48 hours, the United States, in conjunction [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=194.44s)]
*  with Israel, will engage in military action. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=199.28s)]
*  Trump says the Iranians want to fly all the way to the White House to negotiate an end [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=202.48s)]
*  to this. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=206.52s)]
*  But he says it's too late. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=207.52s)]
*  He doesn't appear to be open to long, drawn-out negotiations where he gets strung along like [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  last time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=214.12s)]
*  We're not looking for a ceasefire. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=216.52s)]
*  We're looking for a total, complete victory. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=217.88s)]
*  Again, you know what the victory is. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=220.4s)]
*  We're looking for a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=223.12s)]
*  Trump's made a decision. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=225.04s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program is gone. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=226.92000000000002s)]
*  The person who ultimately decides that is the Ayatollah. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=230.36s)]
*  He can either let us do it peacefully or we'll do it violently. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=234.6s)]
*  But either way, the outcome of this war is this. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=238.68s)]
*  The Iranians will never be able to acquire a nuclear weapon, ever. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=241.20000000000002s)]
*  But time's running out for both sides. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=245.68s)]
*  Israel's reportedly running low on defensive interceptors and Iran's reportedly running [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  low on missiles. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=252.84s)]
*  Iran's also running out of allies. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=254.68s)]
*  They don't have any friends left in the region. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=256.96s)]
*  And China, their biggest customer? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=259.42s)]
*  Quiet. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=261.44s)]
*  And Putin? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=262.62s)]
*  He has his own problems. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=263.62s)]
*  I spoke to him yesterday and I said, you know, he actually offered to help mediate. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=265.8s)]
*  I said, do me a favor. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  Mediate your own. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=272.2s)]
*  Let's mediate Russia first, okay? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=273.2s)]
*  I said, Vladimir, let's mediate Russia first. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=275.08s)]
*  You can worry about this later. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=277.92s)]
*  The Persians are pinned up against the wall. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=280.0s)]
*  They've been completely humiliated by a tiny Jewish nation, a fraction of the size of Iran. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=282.16s)]
*  And now The Daily Wire is reporting that the Mossad set up a fake hotline in Iran and ordered [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=288.36s)]
*  top Iranian military officials into an emergency meeting. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=294.52000000000004s)]
*  And the generals were lured into a small bunker in Tehran before Israel wiped them out with [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=298.0s)]
*  a precision airstrike. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  And inside of the country, you're starting to see unrest. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=306.08000000000004s)]
*  Persians have crippled their economy so badly that workers are rioting over delayed payments. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=309.84s)]
*  Manufacturers are striking over high inflation. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=315.4s)]
*  Schools, cement factories, and pharmaceutical plants are shutting down. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=318.67999999999995s)]
*  The Iranian currency is getting shredded. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=323.52s)]
*  And Israel's hitting Iranian energy infrastructure, which is going to create price shocks and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=326.79999999999995s)]
*  shortages. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  So with the streets teetering and its military commanders assassinated, a nuke might be the [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=332.71999999999997s)]
*  Ayatollah's only hope. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=338.64s)]
*  No one really knows how fast they could spin up a device and strap it into a warhead. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=340.91999999999996s)]
*  But Trump says they're only a few weeks away. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  Back in March, Tulsi Gabbard said the Iranians were enriching uranium at record levels. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=350.52s)]
*  In the past year, we've seen an erosion of a decades long taboo in Iran on discussing [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=356.8s)]
*  nuclear weapons in public, likely emboldening nuclear weapons advocates within Iran's decision [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=360.84s)]
*  making apparatus. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=366.4s)]
*  Iran's enriched uranium stockpile is at its highest levels and is unprecedented for a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=368.6s)]
*  state without nuclear weapons. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=373.68s)]
*  So will the United States end Iran's nuclear program with a 30,000 pound bunker buster? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=376.28000000000003s)]
*  Or can Israel end it themselves? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=382.36s)]
*  Israel admits they have options. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=385.04s)]
*  They could knock out the power plants that run the underground nuke facility. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=386.6s)]
*  And since they control the air, Israeli commandos could be inserted and fight their way in and [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=390.90000000000003s)]
*  then detonate the site with dynamite. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=396.32s)]
*  If America does it, there would be consequences, nuclear contamination, and internationally [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qNyebZaXd6k&t=399.04s)]
