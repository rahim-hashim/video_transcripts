# Israel destroys active Iranian nuclear weapons research facility: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc)
*  Here with reaction to Donald Trump's picks so far, now the confirmation process will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=0.0s)]
*  likely go in January, is the incoming Senate conference chair, Senator Tom Cotton. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=4.16s)]
*  Senator, congratulations on the leadership position. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=8.56s)]
*  You're also going to be chairman of intelligence. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=10.32s)]
*  But your thoughts about what we've seen so far and the speed in which we're getting these [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=12.68s)]
*  nominees. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=16.56s)]
*  Well, thank you, Brian. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=17.56s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=20.2s)]
*  We shouldn't be surprised that President Trump is moving quickly. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=21.76s)]
*  He's already been the president. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=25.6s)]
*  He knows how to do the job. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=26.76s)]
*  He knows the kind of people he wants on the job with him. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=28.16s)]
*  And he campaigned on the promise to shake things up in Washington, to not just go with [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=31.36s)]
*  conventional types of selections, people that want to go. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=36.44s)]
*  He wants people that are going to go into these departments and agencies and actually [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=40.42s)]
*  clear out a lot of the excess bureaucratic waste and the rot and make sure that these [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=44.68s)]
*  department and agencies are working on behalf of the American people, not on behalf of their [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=51.2s)]
*  own interests and fiefdom. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=56.28s)]
*  So I don't think anyone should be surprised that President Trump is moving fast or that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=58.16s)]
*  he's making some unconventional nominees. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=62.12s)]
*  They're going to shake things up. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=64.6s)]
*  That's exactly what he campaigned on. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=65.72s)]
*  The main thing is let's let's have it do the nomination process, but do it quickly. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=67.52s)]
*  You point out in 2009, Barack Obama set a land speed record. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=71.8s)]
*  This confirmations. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=75.75999999999999s)]
*  Can you do the same? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=76.96s)]
*  Yeah, Brian expect us to move very promptly. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=80.28s)]
*  The new Senate will be sworn in on January 3rd. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=82.24s)]
*  It's 17 days before Donald Trump is inaugurated on January 20th. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=84.68s)]
*  We can have committee hearings on these nominees before President Trump is formally inaugurated [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=89.56s)]
*  and can submit the nominations. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=94.56s)]
*  And that means that on January 20th, as soon as he finishes what I'm sure will be a great [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=96.12s)]
*  inaugural address and turns around and walks inside the Capitol, he can sit down and sign [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=101.56s)]
*  the papers that submit those nominations formally. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=106.24000000000001s)]
*  That means the committees can immediately vote on them and we can move them to the floor. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=108.76s)]
*  In 2009, the Senate confirmed nine of Barack Obama's cabinet nominees in just the first [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=112.64s)]
*  48 hours. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=118.16s)]
*  They refused. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=119.44s)]
*  The Democrats refused to do that in 2017. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=120.44s)]
*  But I think that should be the floor that we expect in terms of cooperation from Democrats [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=122.91999999999999s)]
*  this time. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=128.0s)]
*  And there's not going to be the kind of leisurely pace the Senate has sometimes taken in the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=129.0s)]
*  past. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=133.24s)]
*  I expect that we're going to stay in session. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=134.24s)]
*  We're going to work around the clock to process these nominations to make sure Donald Trump [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=136.4s)]
*  gets his appointees into place promptly. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=140.36s)]
*  You're in armed services as well as intelligence. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=143.84s)]
*  I'm sure you probably know to a degree that Israel looks like they have destroyed the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=145.60000000000002s)]
*  active nuclear weapons research facility in Iran with their last with their last hit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=149.76000000000002s)]
*  I did not know they even targeted that. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=155.88000000000002s)]
*  But it looks as though they also wiped out Iran's missile defense. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=158.24s)]
*  Iran is threatening to hit Israel. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=162.60000000000002s)]
*  The president's going to have to the president elect is going to have to deal with this when [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=164.28000000000003s)]
*  he gets into office. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=167.16000000000003s)]
*  What would your recommendation be? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=168.76s)]
*  I know he's got good people around him too about what we should do with this unique opportunity [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=170.07999999999998s)]
*  to maybe take out this weapons program once and for all. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=175.44s)]
*  Well first I would say that Israel faces a serious threat for the next 10 weeks. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=181.04s)]
*  Now I would urge President Biden to stand by Israel to make sure that Israel is well [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=184.68s)]
*  defended and that we back Israel to the hilt. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=188.38s)]
*  But I know that's what President Trump will do from the very beginning. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=190.92s)]
*  They'll back Israel to the hilt. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=193.4s)]
*  Iran is the key threat in the Middle East not only to Israel but to the United States. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=195.68s)]
*  They're behind terrorist organizations like Hamas and Hezbollah. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=200.16s)]
*  But Iran is now exposed on its flanks in the way it hasn't been for decades. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=203.96s)]
*  Hamas is largely destroyed. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=208.32s)]
*  Hezbollah's missiles and rocket forces in Lebanon have been severely degraded. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=210.4s)]
*  That was the main deterrent that Iran used against Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=214.60000000000002s)]
*  And now Israel and Iran have exchanged missile strikes twice. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  missiles have been much more effective as you say destroying a lot of Iran's air defenses. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=221.36s)]
*  So we should back Israel to the hilt. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=226.9s)]
*  And the one thing that President Trump has always been clear about just like Prime Minister [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  Netanyahu is that Iran cannot be allowed to have a nuclear weapon or even be on the verge [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=232.96s)]
*  of having a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  And what your people should understand that when we put up that map of Iran you know who [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=240.8s)]
*  agrees with Senator Tom Cotton said almost every other nation in that area they also [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=244.44000000000003s)]
*  see as Iran is the problem and nobody wants them to have nuclear weapons. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=250.22s)]
*  Senator thanks so much. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=254.66s)]
*  Congratulations on all this change and I look forward to talking to you again soon. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dsGfiYQxmc&t=255.66s)]
