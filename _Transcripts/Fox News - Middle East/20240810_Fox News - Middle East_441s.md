# US warns Iran 'serious risk' if it attacks: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo)
*  Well, Eric, Iran and its allies weighing how to retaliate against Israel without igniting [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=0.0s)]
*  an all-out war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=6.08s)]
*  Tehran is threatening a major attack after Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh was [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=7.72s)]
*  assassinated in Tehran last week. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=13.44s)]
*  The State Department says it should be clear to Iran an attack would mean serious consequences [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  for their government and economy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=22.2s)]
*  It should be very clear to Iran that escalation is not in their interest. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=26.36s)]
*  It's not in Israel's interest. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=30.24s)]
*  It's not in any country in the region's interest. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=31.36s)]
*  We have delivered that message to Israel. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=34.24s)]
*  We know that other countries have delivered it to Iran. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=36.04s)]
*  But it is true they likely have different calculations. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  They may make a different calculation, but I can tell you that the message that we have [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=42.32s)]
*  said loud and clear is we will come to Israel's defense. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  All right, retired Navy Captain Bob Wells joins us now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=49.92s)]
*  So Captain Wells, let's start here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=54.28s)]
*  The U.S. has warned Iran of, quote, serious risk if it conducts a major attack on Israel. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=56.36s)]
*  So what in your expert interpretation is a serious risk? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=63.96s)]
*  Well, thank you very much, Arthel, for having me. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=69.92s)]
*  And I think the serious risk is obviously a military response. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=73.64s)]
*  If Iran uses their proxies as they have done against our troops in Iraq and also in Syria, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=77.84s)]
*  as you just mentioned, we are likely preparing a response in kind against their proxies. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=83.62s)]
*  Obviously they continue to play havoc in the Red Sea with their Houthi proxy. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=90.82s)]
*  And then if you look at what's happening with Hezbollah, their largest proxy in southern [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=97.03999999999999s)]
*  Lebanon, obviously you've got a tit for tat continuing there on the northern front with [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=100.98s)]
*  Israel. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=106.22s)]
*  I do think an important point is to be made with regard to the preview. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=107.22s)]
*  We have communicated to Iran directly, likely through our Swiss channel, likely with our [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=111.42s)]
*  other allies in the region. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=117.26s)]
*  And something's really different since April 13th when they broadcast a response to Israel [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=119.58s)]
*  this time. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=125.74000000000001s)]
*  They've got a brand new president, President Pes Zeschian, a doctor, a cardiac surgeon, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=126.74000000000001s)]
*  in fact, and he's having to deal with the IRGC. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=132.02s)]
*  And if you know, as you know, the IRGC is primarily the capability enhancers for all [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=135.22s)]
*  the proxies in the region. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=140.66s)]
*  I'm going to get back to that in a second. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=141.66s)]
*  But as you know, Captain Wells, risks come with ramifications. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=146.57999999999998s)]
*  What missteps by the U.S. could create damaging residuals? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=152.01999999999998s)]
*  I think if we're not proportional, I think if we hit Iran directly, the president of [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=159.46s)]
*  the United States has to inform the American people of any type of intent with the nation's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=164.38s)]
*  state of Iran versus the United States of America. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=170.18s)]
*  We have very important interests with regard to stability. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=173.54000000000002s)]
*  The president is trying to achieve a ceasefire in Gaza to protect humanitarian efforts there, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=177.42000000000002s)]
*  as well as release the hostages, as I understand August 15th is that particular time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=183.94s)]
*  But to answer your question directly, though, an over-response, although we do have the [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=189.54000000000002s)]
*  capability. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=194.3s)]
*  So that we can answer the call with regard to the mission. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=226.06s)]
*  And given the posturing and politics at play, how do you expect the leaders of Iran and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=231.14000000000001s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu to play this out? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=237.82000000000002s)]
*  Will they agree to a ceasefire? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  And if so, how soon? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think it's a very complicated circumstance. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=246.18s)]
*  Obviously, the American policy effort is focused on a ceasefire. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=249.82000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli military policy effort is to basically eradicate Hamas and to also reduce [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=254.78s)]
*  risk against the proxies. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=260.94s)]
*  I think it's going to play out with this new president with regard to what his course of [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=263.34s)]
*  action will be. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=268.94s)]
*  I think Iran will strike. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=269.94s)]
*  They may not strike Israel directly. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=271.98s)]
*  I think with this new president, as I've read some of the internal discussions, may feel [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=274.1s)]
*  lucky that Iran is not at war directly with Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  And I understand that maybe a suggestion would be on the table to hit other Mossad targets [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=285.22s)]
*  in either Iraqi Kurdistan or in Azerbaijan. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=291.26s)]
*  So there's other options there to hurt Israel with regard to its particular interests. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=295.34000000000003s)]
*  But back to American interests in the United States, we're doing our best with regard to [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=301.1s)]
*  military posture. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=305.7s)]
*  We've got a very capable central commander, General Karela. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=307.18s)]
*  And we also have diplomacy, which is intense, it's persistent by the administration to try [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=311.97999999999996s)]
*  to bring about the ceasefire. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=317.94s)]
*  You mentioned proxies a moment ago. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=323.46s)]
*  And while we look at a map, I want to show a map of Iranian-backed proxies in the Middle [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  East, let's talk again about Hezbollah and Hamas, the terrorist organizations who are [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=329.98s)]
*  not bound by international protocol. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=334.54s)]
*  I mean, how can they bungle even the best of plans? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=337.18s)]
*  That's a great question, because it's always been interesting to me. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=342.90000000000003s)]
*  You've got nation-state of Iran, nation-state of Lebanon, nation-state of Yemen, yet they [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=345.5s)]
*  have these proxies within their borders. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=350.06s)]
*  Hezbollah has been growing in terms of its Shiite intent to basically eradicate Israel. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=352.58000000000004s)]
*  They've gone to war, as you remember, back in 2006. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=358.46000000000004s)]
*  There's a UN border force there. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  So they can overstep their bounds. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=363.34s)]
*  But just offshore, you've got the United States with strike missiles and other capability [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=365.29999999999995s)]
*  that could eradicate certain Hezbollah capability and to defend Israel if it came to them. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=371.02s)]
*  The other part is the Houthis. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=378.21999999999997s)]
*  We're still receiving quite a bit of challenge there with the Houthis. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=381.09999999999997s)]
*  And that's an everyday military operation, and naval operations have been at combat levels [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=386.02s)]
*  ever since October. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=390.86s)]
*  Yeah, and a lot happening indeed. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=391.86s)]
*  And let's say, before I let you go, I want to mention this. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=396.78000000000003s)]
*  Let's not forget the hostages. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=398.82s)]
*  115 hostages are being held in Gaza. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=400.62s)]
*  41, unfortunately, are considered dead in their bodies or in the hands of Hamas there [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=404.98s)]
*  in Gaza. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=409.38s)]
*  You just mentioned that you believe they will be freed come August 15th. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=410.38s)]
*  I pray that happens, if not before then. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=414.18s)]
*  Retired Navy Captain Bob Wells, thank you so much, sir. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=417.9s)]
*  Thank you, Arthel. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=423.41999999999996s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=424.41999999999996s)]
*  I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFc55SCINoo&t=425.41999999999996s)]
