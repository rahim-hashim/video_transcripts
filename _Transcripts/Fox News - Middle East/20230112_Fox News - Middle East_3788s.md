# Karine Jean-Pierre grilled over stash of Biden classified documents: 'We're being careful'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U)
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=0.0s)]
*  Good afternoon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=6.16s)]
*  OK, just two quick things at the top. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=10.96s)]
*  We've seen the breaking news reports of the tornado damage in Selma. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  First, our hearts and thoughts go out to the Selma community [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=18.44s)]
*  and everyone impacted by the storm. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=22.52s)]
*  Our team here is monitoring and assessing the situation [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=25.52s)]
*  and reaching out as appropriate to local and state officials [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=29.0s)]
*  to offer our support. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=32.4s)]
*  And before I start and turn over to my colleague who [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=34.52s)]
*  is going to be giving you all a preview of the bilat [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=37.28s)]
*  that the president's going to have with the Japanese prime minister [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=40.76s)]
*  and also do a preview of next Tuesday with the president's bilat [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=43.96s)]
*  with the prime minister of Netherlands, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=48.64s)]
*  I just want to say a couple of things and make sure that everyone saw this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=50.32s)]
*  It's a statement from Richard Sauber. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=57.0s)]
*  His statement reads, as the president said, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=59.84s)]
*  he takes classified information and materials seriously. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=62.08s)]
*  And as we have said, we have cooperated from the moment [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=66.2s)]
*  we informed the archives that a small number of documents were found. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=69.92s)]
*  And we will continue to cooperate. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=75.2s)]
*  We have cooperated closely with the Justice Department throughout its review. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=77.94s)]
*  And we will continue that cooperation with the special counsel. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=82.98s)]
*  We are confident that a thorough review will [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=87.66s)]
*  show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=90.86s)]
*  and the president and his lawyers acted promptly [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=95.22s)]
*  upon discovering of this mistake. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=97.82s)]
*  With that, my colleague is here, John Kirby, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=101.34s)]
*  to talk through the bilat tomorrow and also with Japan prime minister [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=103.86s)]
*  and also the bilat with the prime minister of Netherlands next Tuesday. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=107.3s)]
*  And then I'll come back. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=110.14s)]
*  Good afternoon, everybody. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=113.94s)]
*  I think tomorrow, you know, President Biden [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=116.74s)]
*  is going to be welcoming the Prime Minister of Japan here to the White House. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=118.58s)]
*  He's looking very much forward to that. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=121.9s)]
*  Two leaders have already gotten to know each other quite well [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=124.5s)]
*  during in-depth discussions over the last year, Cambodia, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=127.5s)]
*  at the East Asia Summit, and in Tokyo for their bilateral meeting [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=131.42s)]
*  in the Quad Summit in May of 2022, as well as through their work together [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=134.82s)]
*  at the G7. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=139.3s)]
*  Since taking office, President Biden has invested in our alliances [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=141.26s)]
*  to better equip us to collectively take on the 21st century challenges we [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=144.17999999999998s)]
*  face, whether that's the DPRK's pursuit of weapons of mass destruction [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=148.17999999999998s)]
*  and ballistic missile and their ballistic missile program, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=154.7s)]
*  China's assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region and globally, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  or of course Russia's unprovoked war in Ukraine. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=161.57999999999998s)]
*  Now, on each of these challenges and on many more, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=163.98s)]
*  Japan has proven a steadfast ally ready to step up and do its part [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=166.85999999999999s)]
*  to advance our shared national security interests and values. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=170.58s)]
*  Now, I'm just going to set a little bit of the backdrop here [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=174.9s)]
*  for this particular visit. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=177.38000000000002s)]
*  Last month, Prime Minister Kishida released Japan's new national security [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=179.10000000000002s)]
*  strategy and committed to boosting Japan's defense spending to 2% [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  of their GDP. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=187.9s)]
*  That includes investments in new defense capabilities, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=189.98000000000002s)]
*  and that's a historic commitment by Japan. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=192.82000000000002s)]
*  Prime Minister Kishida will arrive in Washington [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=195.5s)]
*  after a set of extensive, actually has arrived, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=198.22s)]
*  after a set of extensive discussions with European partners from Italy [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=201.22s)]
*  to the UK to France, of course to Canada. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=205.34s)]
*  And he and President Biden are going to have the opportunity [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=208.26s)]
*  to debrief on those discussions as well. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=210.54s)]
*  And then, of course, yesterday, he saw the two foreign ministers [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=213.46s)]
*  and the two defense ministers of our countries get together [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=216.62s)]
*  and announced some significant new improvements to the alliance, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=219.62s)]
*  upgrades, in fact, to US force posture in Japan, which [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=224.14s)]
*  will now include the stationing of a Marine Littoral Regiment [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=227.1s)]
*  in Okinawa, as well as advanced capabilities [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=230.22s)]
*  from intelligence collection analysis to anti-ship capabilities. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=233.29999999999998s)]
*  We modernize the alliance by announcing that attacks [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=239.1s)]
*  to, from, and within space could lead to the invocation of Article 5 [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=242.42s)]
*  of the US-Japan Security Treaty, expanding bilateral exercises [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=247.98s)]
*  between our two countries, and training, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=251.94s)]
*  which includes in Japan's southwest islands. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=254.01999999999998s)]
*  And of course, deepening cooperation in the region [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=258.06s)]
*  to include trilateral training and exercises with Australia [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=260.14s)]
*  and increasing cooperation with the Republic of Korea [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=264.06s)]
*  on ballistic missile defense, anti-submarine warfare, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=267.46s)]
*  maritime security. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=269.98s)]
*  All these moves are not only going to strengthen our combined ability [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=271.3s)]
*  to defend Japan, but also will allow the United States and Japan [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=274.09999999999997s)]
*  together to provide for peace and security in the Indo-Pacific region [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=277.7s)]
*  and bolster deterrence in the region and globally. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=281.78s)]
*  Now, I do think that tomorrow we'll also give President Biden [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=285.38s)]
*  an opportunity to discuss with Prime Minister [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=288.26s)]
*  Kishida progress that we're going to be able to make together [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=290.5s)]
*  in this coming year on a range of national security economic issues. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=293.61999999999995s)]
*  Japan, I think you know, holds the G7 presidency. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=297.46s)]
*  They've just taken a seat on the UN Security Council. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=300.53999999999996s)]
*  And while we're going to be hosting the APEC this year, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=303.5s)]
*  as well as seeking to make swift progress on the Indo-Pacific economic [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=305.78s)]
*  framework, there's a lot of overlap there. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=308.9s)]
*  And we're looking forward to that. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=310.7s)]
*  We'll discuss how we're going to align these agendas going forward. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=312.18s)]
*  So tomorrow's program, we expect, is going to be a full one. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=316.21999999999997s)]
*  But from our perspective, the message is absolutely clear. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=318.74s)]
*  Japan is stepping up and doing so in lockstep with the United States. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=322.09999999999997s)]
*  Our investment in our alliances is paying huge dividends. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=326.94s)]
*  And we look forward to celebrating that tomorrow. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=330.41999999999996s)]
*  Speaking of alliances and partnerships, I'm also [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=332.62s)]
*  pleased to announce that next week, President Biden [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=335.62s)]
*  will welcome Prime Minister Mark Rutte of the Netherlands [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=337.86s)]
*  to the White House on Tuesday the 17th to further deepen [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=340.74s)]
*  the historic ties between our two nations. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=343.82s)]
*  As strong NATO allies and global partners, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=346.06s)]
*  these two leaders are going to reaffirm our shared [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=348.38s)]
*  efforts to strengthen transatlantic security [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=350.46s)]
*  and economic prosperity. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=352.5s)]
*  They'll discuss our steadfast support of Ukraine. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=354.14s)]
*  And the Netherlands has been a very key supporter of security assistance [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=356.82s)]
*  in Ukraine. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=361.5s)]
*  In fact, they've already provided a billion dollars of that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=362.46s)]
*  and are committing more. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=367.94s)]
*  I'm sorry, almost $3 billion committed and committing almost a billion more [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=369.02s)]
*  going forward. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=373.94s)]
*  They're going to be able to discuss all that cooperation going forward [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=374.9s)]
*  on critical technologies and a shared vision for a swift end [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  to this war in Ukraine. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=382.38s)]
*  They also plan to talk about a range of issues [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=384.14s)]
*  that are essential to strengthening democracy, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=386.38s)]
*  whether that's respect for human rights, rules-based international order [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=388.29999999999995s)]
*  and including as co-host of the upcoming second summit for democracy. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=391.74s)]
*  So a big week next week too with a very key ally and partner. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=396.02s)]
*  We're looking forward to that. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=398.7s)]
*  Thank you, Brian. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=399.98s)]
*  John, I understand that the leaders will be focused [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=402.42s)]
*  on deterring the threat from China as well as other adversaries, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=406.02s)]
*  including Russia, nuclear-powered adversaries, North Korea, Russia, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=409.74s)]
*  China. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=414.18s)]
*  But what would the leaders be thinking about in terms [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=414.94s)]
*  of this latest reaction, this latest announcement from South Korea [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=418.38s)]
*  saying that they're open to acquiring nuclear weapons? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=421.62s)]
*  Will President Biden and Prime Minister Kishida be focused on this? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=425.26s)]
*  And does the administration believe that a nuclear South Korea [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=429.34000000000003s)]
*  contradicts US policy of denuclearization [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=432.74s)]
*  in the entire peninsula? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=435.54s)]
*  The United States remains committed, President Biden [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=437.14s)]
*  remains committed to the complete denuclearization of the peninsula. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=439.26s)]
*  And that hasn't changed. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=445.14s)]
*  The Republic of Korea has made clear that they are not [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=448.82s)]
*  seeking nuclear weapons. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=452.46s)]
*  But what we are going to seek jointly together with them [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=454.82s)]
*  are improvements in extended deterrence capabilities. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=458.46000000000004s)]
*  So we're going to move forward on that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=464.1s)]
*  While we have you here, Ukraine has confirmed [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=466.26s)]
*  that they will be receiving tanks from the UK as well as Poland. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=469.22s)]
*  And during President Zelensky's visit, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=474.65999999999997s)]
*  I think President Biden made it clear that the reason that the US is not [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=477.02s)]
*  providing all the weapons that Ukraine is asking, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=480.26s)]
*  including these kinds of tanks, is to ensure that the US is avoiding [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=482.94s)]
*  an escalation to the war and ensuring NATO unity. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=490.58s)]
*  Does the president believe that UK and Poland's decision [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=493.78s)]
*  to provide tanks to Ukraine will work against those goals? [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=497.41999999999996s)]
*  The president fully supports those decisions. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=501.02s)]
*  And those are sovereign decisions that those nations [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=502.82s)]
*  make about this kind of security assistance they provide. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=505.06s)]
*  That's been the case throughout this entire length of the war. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=507.34s)]
*  We respect that sovereignty. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=510.86s)]
*  And we certainly are grateful for all the additional security assistance [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=512.58s)]
*  that nations are providing. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=517.02s)]
*  I talked about the Netherlands. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=518.14s)]
*  They've provided air defense capabilities as well as howitzers. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=519.5s)]
*  So we're grateful for that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=524.66s)]
*  But these are decisions that they have to make. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=526.02s)]
*  The president believes. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=527.86s)]
*  And these announcements, I think, reinforce this belief [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=530.1s)]
*  that there is terrific solidarity by the international community [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=533.66s)]
*  behind Ukraine and finding ways to support Ukraine. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=537.78s)]
*  Just next week, the Secretary of Defense [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=540.46s)]
*  will be hosting yet another contact group meeting over in Europe [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  to find ways to contribute more security assistance from more partners. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=546.66s)]
*  Those have been very, very successful. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=552.0600000000001s)]
*  So the president believes that all these decisions are actually [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=553.66s)]
*  mutually reinforcing of a larger issue here, [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=557.7s)]
*  and that is solid international community support behind Ukraine. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  Can we have a little while of this? [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=563.1s)]
*  Just a recap on the visit tomorrow. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=564.58s)]
*  Is there going to be any more announcement outside of the defense [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=566.0600000000001s)]
*  aspects of this visit? [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=569.6600000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of the meeting that hasn't happened yet. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=571.26s)]
*  I'll let the president summarize it. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=573.98s)]
*  We'll have a readout afterward. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=576.4200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=577.94s)]
*  Non-Japan question since we have you here, John. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=578.7800000000001s)]
*  An organization called Hostage Aid Worldwide [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=582.3000000000001s)]
*  has sent a letter to the president asking for a meeting with him [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=585.94s)]
*  regarding the hostages that have been held who are dual-national, who [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=590.1s)]
*  have been held all over the world, but particularly in Iran. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=594.58s)]
*  Until now, they have not got an answer. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=597.5400000000001s)]
*  Do you know why the White House has not given them the attention that [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=599.6600000000001s)]
*  has been given to other hostages? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=603.5s)]
*  We take each case seriously, and we take each case individually. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=605.2600000000001s)]
*  And just to be clear, dual-national citizenship [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=610.34s)]
*  has nothing to do with it. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=614.82s)]
*  If you have a blue passport, if you're an American citizen, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=615.9000000000001s)]
*  whether you're a citizen of another nation or not, doesn't matter. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=619.82s)]
*  That means you're going to be treated the same. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=623.46s)]
*  All Americans are treated the same, regardless [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=625.3000000000001s)]
*  of whether they have citizenship in another nation. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=627.5s)]
*  Paul Whalen's a great example of that. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=631.0600000000001s)]
*  So we work each case individually. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=633.4200000000001s)]
*  We work each case seriously, and we try to keep the families [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=635.5s)]
*  as informed as possible. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=639.0600000000001s)]
*  I won't speak to specific meetings that have or have not occurred. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=640.8199999999999s)]
*  When we get requests for meetings, we take those seriously, too, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=646.9399999999999s)]
*  and do the best we can to accommodate it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=650.66s)]
*  And certainly, we want to make sure that in our communications [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=652.9399999999999s)]
*  with family members, that we are not doing or saying anything that actually [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=658.66s)]
*  makes it harder for us to establish a release mechanism for them. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=661.74s)]
*  And you have to be mindful of that. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=668.26s)]
*  When you're in the public talking about these cases, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=669.82s)]
*  that you've got to be careful that you're not [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=673.5400000000001s)]
*  putting anything out there in the public space that could make it harder. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=675.82s)]
*  So each one is reviewed individually and sincerely. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=678.6400000000001s)]
*  And if a meeting can be done and should be done, [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=682.2600000000001s)]
*  then we certainly will work to accommodate that. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=684.74s)]
*  Would you follow up with this letter? [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=687.5s)]
*  I'm sorry? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=689.3000000000001s)]
*  Would you follow up with the letter that the US government has? [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=689.8000000000001s)]
*  We're familiar with the letter. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=692.1s)]
*  I don't have a response to the letter for you. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=693.22s)]
*  I wouldn't do that from the podium. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=694.98s)]
*  We'll certainly respond appropriately. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=696.3800000000001s)]
*  Is Ridge Alcones on the agenda for tomorrow, John? [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=698.5s)]
*  I won't get ahead of the president's discussion with Prime Minister [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=701.26s)]
*  Kishida James. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=705.9s)]
*  We're certainly, the president is aware of lieutenant circumstances in Japan, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=707.1s)]
*  as is leadership across the military in the Defense Department. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=713.62s)]
*  But I won't preview or get ahead of the president's specific agenda. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=717.78s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=723.02s)]
*  Can you give us your reaction, the president's reaction, [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=724.3s)]
*  to reports that Russia is building up its forces in the east? [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=726.86s)]
*  What's the significance of that? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=731.0600000000001s)]
*  And where do things stand in terms of any potential effort [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=732.58s)]
*  to try to get the two sides to sit down at the table? [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=735.82s)]
*  Even in the east of, inside Ukraine? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=739.26s)]
*  Inside Ukraine? [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=741.86s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=742.7s)]
*  And I have one more follow-up. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=743.2s)]
*  We've obviously been watching very closely military operations, [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=744.66s)]
*  particularly in the east of Ukraine, the Donbas area. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=748.34s)]
*  And as I've said, even from here in the briefing room, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=751.5s)]
*  the violence, the fighting in areas around Bakhmut, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=754.66s)]
*  and now this town called Solidar, has been significant and severe. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=757.86s)]
*  And the fighting has been sharp between both sides. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=763.66s)]
*  We've talked about in Bakhmut specifically, [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=767.4599999999999s)]
*  this is largely private military contractors. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=769.66s)]
*  It's Mr. Purgosian largely in the Wagner group [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=772.9s)]
*  that have been involved in much of the ground fighting there. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=775.26s)]
*  But it has been vicious. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=778.02s)]
*  And that's why going into the winter, knowing that the fighting isn't slowing [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=779.54s)]
*  down there, that we have been so focused on providing additional security [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=784.3s)]
*  assistance to Ukraine just last week. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=787.54s)]
*  Kareem announced for you nearly $3 billion worth of systems. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=789.26s)]
*  And there will be more coming, Kristen. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=793.8599999999999s)]
*  I can't speak to Russian intent here or specific unit movements [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=795.9799999999999s)]
*  or what their goals are. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=800.74s)]
*  I wouldn't presume to speak for the Russian Defense Ministry. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=802.38s)]
*  I would just tell you that as they continue to literally throw bodies [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=805.74s)]
*  at the fighting in Bakhmut, because they [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=810.9799999999999s)]
*  have lost an extraordinary amount of largely convicts in this fighting, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=812.62s)]
*  as they continue to do that, they need to know and understand [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=817.38s)]
*  that the United States, as well as our allies and partners, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=820.38s)]
*  are going to continue to make sure that Ukraine can defend itself in that area [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=822.86s)]
*  and do so effectively. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=827.1s)]
*  And I mean, I don't mean to belabor this, but look at the area, right? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=828.74s)]
*  This is the Donbas area. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=832.26s)]
*  We've talked about this. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=833.22s)]
*  It's a lot like Kansas. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=833.9s)]
*  It's farmland. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=835.02s)]
*  It's open ground. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=835.74s)]
*  And so we want to make sure that we are providing the kinds of capabilities [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=837.26s)]
*  to Ukraine to be able to succeed in that environment. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=840.26s)]
*  That's why Bradley Fighting Vehicles were part of the package [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=842.3s)]
*  that Karine announced. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=844.78s)]
*  That's why the Pentagon will very soon be, DOD and our allies, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=846.18s)]
*  will be starting some combined arms maneuver training outside of Ukraine [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=851.06s)]
*  for up to battalion level units of the Ukrainian Armed Forces [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=855.02s)]
*  to help them in this fight. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=858.3s)]
*  Can I just try one more? [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=859.9s)]
*  We're going to direct 99% of our questions about the classified documents. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=861.2199999999999s)]
*  It would be OK with me if it was 100%. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=864.2199999999999s)]
*  I do have one for you. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=865.78s)]
*  Has there been an assessment about any potential national security [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=867.6999999999999s)]
*  risk of having these classified documents in the president's private think [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=871.22s)]
*  tank here in Washington and his home in Delaware? [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=875.5400000000001s)]
*  That would be a question for the Justice Department, [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=878.46s)]
*  because they are conducting a review now. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=880.82s)]
*  You saw that they've announced a special counsel. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=883.5s)]
*  That issue would be for them to speak to. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=886.46s)]
*  And you speak broadly to the national security [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=888.6600000000001s)]
*  concerns about having classified documents in private spaces. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=891.22s)]
*  The president has spoken to how seriously he [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=894.26s)]
*  takes the handling of classified documents. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=896.94s)]
*  And as somebody who is aware of the process myself, [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=900.5s)]
*  did exactly the right thing, which is to have them immediately turned over. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=906.98s)]
*  And that's where this appropriately lies. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=911.26s)]
*  And again, the Justice Department would be the place [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=914.46s)]
*  to go to answer your question. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=917.3000000000001s)]
*  So I have one question on Japan, then maybe one on Ukraine. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=920.82s)]
*  On Japan, are they going to be discussing the semiconductor exports to China [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=923.9s)]
*  and efforts to restrict those exports? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=932.3s)]
*  Is that going to be a topic? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=935.14s)]
*  And do you see this as very important to have a country like Japan join [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=936.4599999999999s)]
*  those efforts to have some sort of chips control, if not a ban, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=941.78s)]
*  but to have efforts in that area to control it? [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=945.34s)]
*  Again, I want to be careful not to get ahead of President Biden. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=948.98s)]
*  I think, as I alluded to, it's going to be a very full and robust agenda. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=952.14s)]
*  But I think it's safe to say that when it comes to issues, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=956.54s)]
*  he discusses routinely with his counterparts [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=960.26s)]
*  bilaterally and in multilateral settings. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=963.4200000000001s)]
*  Supply chains, resilient supply chains to include with respect [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=965.54s)]
*  to high technology is always a part of the discussion. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=970.1800000000001s)]
*  But I won't, again, get ahead of what they're going to say. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=973.86s)]
*  And on Ukraine, I know you've said many times [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=977.4200000000001s)]
*  you don't want to talk about the intent of the Russians. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=979.74s)]
*  But what do you make of the new assignment, [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=982.42s)]
*  if you could call it, of Valeriy Gerasimov? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=988.58s)]
*  And what does that say maybe about the Russian strategy [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=991.38s)]
*  as he's been named the new man in charge of the war effort? [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=995.54s)]
*  They've gone through quite a few leadership changes, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=999.3s)]
*  haven't they, now in 10 and 1 1.5 months. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1001.34s)]
*  And again, I think Kareem said this very well yesterday. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1003.62s)]
*  We'll let the Kremlin speak to their decision-making here. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1007.54s)]
*  But they've gone through a lot of leadership changes, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1011.4599999999999s)]
*  clearly in an effort, almost from very early on, [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1014.5799999999999s)]
*  in an effort to overcome the sorts of difficulties [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1019.86s)]
*  they've had in this war, difficulties which remain, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1022.6999999999999s)]
*  whether that's logistics and sustainment, ISR, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1025.22s)]
*  intelligence, surveillance, reconnaissance, the ability [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1028.86s)]
*  to gather information, to communicate, command [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1031.1s)]
*  and control between units, certainly unit morale [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1033.74s)]
*  and cohesion, and without a doubt. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1036.54s)]
*  I mean, just look at what's been going on [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1038.86s)]
*  in the last couple of weeks, battlefield performance. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1040.78s)]
*  So interesting that they have now gone back [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1043.54s)]
*  to Gerasimov, who was in charge at the very beginning, who [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1045.5s)]
*  is essentially the chief of their army staff, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1048.98s)]
*  not an operational commander. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1050.8999999999999s)]
*  It's an interesting selection. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1052.34s)]
*  I think they should speak to that. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1053.86s)]
*  But I think it's indicative and shows the degree to which [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1055.94s)]
*  Russians continue to struggle to get it right in terms [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1059.54s)]
*  of just leadership, command, and control problems. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1062.22s)]
*  ARIEL KELTNER-GILBERT, The Washington Post [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1064.7s)]
*  I had a question. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1066.46s)]
*  Tensions are rising again between Sweden and Turkey. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1067.38s)]
*  How confident are you that these two countries can resolve [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1071.8600000000001s)]
*  these tensions? [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1075.38s)]
*  And how confident are you that Sweden [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1076.42s)]
*  would be able to join NATO soon? [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1079.38s)]
*  And I would have a follow-up. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1081.3400000000001s)]
*  We firmly support their ascension. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1082.3s)]
*  I think you know that. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1083.8s)]
*  President Biden's made that very, very clear. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1084.8s)]
*  And so too does the vast majority of NATO nations. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1087.14s)]
*  I certainly let those two nations [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1093.86s)]
*  speak for themselves in terms of the discussions [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1095.8999999999999s)]
*  that they're having. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1097.74s)]
*  You saw yesterday Swedish officials [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1098.5s)]
*  said publicly that they believe that these discussions are [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1100.26s)]
*  actually on a positive track. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1103.54s)]
*  And we certainly hope that's the case. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1105.86s)]
*  And on the classified documents, have there [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1107.54s)]
*  been any other countries in touch with the administration [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1109.74s)]
*  expressing some kind of concerns about how secure classified [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1114.62s)]
*  documents are and how confidential information [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1118.66s)]
*  about those countries could have circulated? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1122.06s)]
*  I'm not aware of any such discussions or concerns. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1124.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1130.1799999999998s)]
*  The family and supporters of Russian dissident Alexei [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1133.1399999999999s)]
*  Navalny are increasingly concerned about his health. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1137.5s)]
*  In fact, even Russian doctors are openly [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1140.3s)]
*  putting their name to a letter. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1142.4199999999998s)]
*  Is there anything you can do to let the Kremlin know that [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1144.98s)]
*  we share their concerns? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1147.54s)]
*  And continue to believe that you should be immediately [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1148.6599999999999s)]
*  released, obviously. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1151.9s)]
*  And short of that, to insist that he [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1153.42s)]
*  gets proper medical care. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1157.22s)]
*  So we've seen those concerns and share those concerns. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1159.38s)]
*  And we'll continue to make plain those concerns [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1162.6200000000001s)]
*  to Russian authorities. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1169.0600000000002s)]
*  Is the United States concerned that Solidar [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1172.1000000000001s)]
*  has fallen to the Russians or could be falling [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1175.94s)]
*  to the Russians? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1178.22s)]
*  Can't confirm the reports that it's fallen. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1179.02s)]
*  I've seen the Russian proclamations about this. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1181.02s)]
*  The Ukrainians tell a different story. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1184.58s)]
*  We're not on the ground. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1186.54s)]
*  So we're not in a position to confirm it. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1187.5s)]
*  It's a small village in the Donbas. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1190.74s)]
*  We believe that the Russian interest in it [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1194.3s)]
*  is sort of twofold. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1197.02s)]
*  One, because they see it's securing it [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1197.94s)]
*  as key to their ability to hold and secure [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1202.3s)]
*  and to hold Bakhmut. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1204.98s)]
*  There's also salt mines there. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1207.26s)]
*  So we also think that there's a bit of an economic incentive, [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1209.22s)]
*  particularly by Mr. Prokoshen, to take possession. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1211.66s)]
*  And if Russia were to take Solidar, [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1214.46s)]
*  what would that say about Russian advances in that area? [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1216.1000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, great question. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1219.8600000000001s)]
*  I think, look, we've got to keep this in perspective. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1220.78s)]
*  We don't know how it's going to go. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1226.06s)]
*  So I'm not going to predict failure or success here. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1227.5s)]
*  But even if both Bakhmut and Solidar fall to the Russians, [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1232.26s)]
*  it's not going to have a strategic impact on the war itself. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1237.34s)]
*  And it certainly isn't going to stop the Ukrainians [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1244.1799999999998s)]
*  or slow them down in terms of their efforts [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1246.54s)]
*  to regain their territory. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1250.22s)]
*  And I would remind, I mean, I know we're all focused [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1252.3799999999999s)]
*  on those two towns right now. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1254.4599999999998s)]
*  But just, again, take a couple of steps back. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1255.6999999999998s)]
*  And if you look at what's been happening over the last 10 [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1257.6999999999998s)]
*  and 1.5 months, particularly in the Donbas, towns and villages [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1260.02s)]
*  have swapped hands quite frequently. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1262.58s)]
*  So my last comment would be, don't count the Ukrainians out. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1265.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1272.62s)]
*  I would like to follow up on Tatsi's question [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1273.3s)]
*  on the tanks for Ukraine. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1275.62s)]
*  Poland says that it will deliver the tanks only [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1277.7s)]
*  as a part of a larger international coalition. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1280.3s)]
*  And it's encouraging other countries to join. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1284.7s)]
*  So I'm wondering if President Biden [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1288.22s)]
*  is considering joining this coalition [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1290.46s)]
*  by sending US Abrams tanks, and if he's encouraging [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1293.42s)]
*  other countries, including Germany, to do the same. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1298.3400000000001s)]
*  I won't get ahead of decisions on security assistance [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1303.18s)]
*  that haven't been made yet. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1306.18s)]
*  We have been, I think, very effective at providing [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1309.26s)]
*  security assistance that evolves with the way the war has evolved. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1315.02s)]
*  And now, two weeks ago, we were talking about Patriots and air [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1320.5s)]
*  defense, and today we're talking about armored vehicles and tanks. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1324.82s)]
*  So I won't get ahead of the President's decisions [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1329.94s)]
*  he's going to make. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1331.98s)]
*  As I said to Tatsi, we're grateful for the support [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1332.82s)]
*  that other nations are providing. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1335.3s)]
*  They each do it in their own way, in a size, scale, and scope, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1337.66s)]
*  and a pace that they're comfortable with. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1342.34s)]
*  These are sovereign decisions, and we respect that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1344.34s)]
*  President Zelensky has said he's interested in tanks, [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1346.62s)]
*  and now you have some countries that are showing a willingness [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1349.22s)]
*  to provide tanks. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1351.8600000000001s)]
*  That's all to the good. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1352.54s)]
*  The United States will continue to provide our security assistance [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1354.06s)]
*  in the same way we have for the last 10 and 1 1 months, [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1357.6200000000001s)]
*  working in lockstep with the Ukrainians [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1360.98s)]
*  and making sure that we're meeting their needs as best we can. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1363.3s)]
*  And if we can't, that we're working with allies and partners to do the same. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1366.22s)]
*  And again, you asked about this coalition or alliance. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1370.14s)]
*  Again, we believe that there has been an incredible framework [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1378.14s)]
*  established already internationally to provide assistance, security [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1383.18s)]
*  assistance specifically to Ukraine, and that's [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1387.3000000000002s)]
*  through this Ukraine Defense Contact Group. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1389.14s)]
*  There's another meeting next week. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1391.0200000000002s)]
*  We're very excited about that and looking forward to it. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1392.42s)]
*  Can I follow up? [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1394.0600000000002s)]
*  Because the President says that the war is in a critical point. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1394.7s)]
*  If the war is at a critical point, why wait? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1398.5s)]
*  It takes time to train Ukrainians to operate those tanks. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1402.0600000000002s)]
*  Nobody's waiting. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1406.46s)]
*  Nobody's waiting. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1407.54s)]
*  I mean, almost every two weeks like clockwork, [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1408.7s)]
*  we're getting up here and talking to you about billions of dollars [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1411.02s)]
*  of more assistance that are going to Ukraine. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1414.62s)]
*  The United States is the leader of the war. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1416.94s)]
*  Almost $25 billion since the start of this war. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1419.58s)]
*  No other nation comes close to providing the kind of security assistance [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1423.94s)]
*  that we have. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1426.82s)]
*  It's not about waiting. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1427.34s)]
*  It's about working in lockstep with Ukrainians, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1428.34s)]
*  making sure that we understand their needs and capabilities, [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1430.74s)]
*  and delivering those capabilities the best way that we can. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1433.3s)]
*  And when I say we, I don't just mean the US. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1437.22s)]
*  I mean the big we. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1439.1000000000001s)]
*  And sometimes those assets are not going to come from the United States. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1440.58s)]
*  Sometimes they're going to come from other nations. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1444.06s)]
*  And maybe that's better for the Ukrainians, [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1446.1000000000001s)]
*  either because they can get there faster or because it's [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1448.66s)]
*  a capability that they're more comfortable using [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1451.98s)]
*  and won't need quite as much training and operation and maintenance on it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1453.8600000000001s)]
*  There's lots of things that go into these decisions. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1457.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1460.74s)]
*  All right, Justin, you have the last question. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1461.24s)]
*  Oh, I was, in fact, going to ask not that we don't always [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1462.98s)]
*  appreciate your appearance in the briefing room, but if we could maybe [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1465.78s)]
*  better take a look. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1468.8999999999999s)]
*  I was trying to give you a little bit of a question. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1469.74s)]
*  It's fine with me. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1471.8999999999999s)]
*  I will depart. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1472.7s)]
*  All right, thanks, everybody. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1474.34s)]
*  Justin. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1476.58s)]
*  Jeez. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1477.94s)]
*  Justin. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1479.3s)]
*  Oh, my goodness. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1480.18s)]
*  Wow. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1483.46s)]
*  Justin did not hold back at all. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1484.5s)]
*  I think you did that on the plane last week, too. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1489.46s)]
*  I remember. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1492.1s)]
*  I'm keeping track. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1492.62s)]
*  I'm keeping track. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1494.1s)]
*  I'm Fimad. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1494.8999999999999s)]
*  All right, Chris, it's yours. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1497.78s)]
*  So a few questions about the classified documents. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1500.4199999999998s)]
*  First off, is the president willing to be interviewed by federal investigators [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1502.5s)]
*  about his handling of classified documents? [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1505.6599999999999s)]
*  So first, let me just say I'm just not going to get into hypotheticals. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1507.22s)]
*  This is something for the Department of. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1510.5s)]
*  It's not a hypothetical question. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1512.26s)]
*  There's an investigation ongoing for the president's meeting. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1513.02s)]
*  It's an ongoing review. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1515.46s)]
*  You're asking me about something in the future, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1517.86s)]
*  and I am telling you that I'm not going to get ahead of what [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1519.82s)]
*  the Department of Justice is going to decide. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1522.1s)]
*  Look, I want to reiterate what you heard from the president today. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1524.1799999999998s)]
*  It is important for the American people to know this, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1527.3799999999999s)]
*  is that the president has said he takes classified documents [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1531.1799999999998s)]
*  and information very seriously. [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1534.4599999999998s)]
*  This is something, as you all know, that he will not shy away from saying [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1536.5s)]
*  and has continued to say this this week. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1542.06s)]
*  And again, he was surprised that these records have been found. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1544.1799999999998s)]
*  He does not know what's in them. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1547.78s)]
*  And his team, once they identified that these documents were there, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1549.74s)]
*  they immediately reached out to the archives of the Department of Justice [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1555.14s)]
*  and did the rightfully so, did the right thing by turning that over. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1559.5s)]
*  And they have been cooperating very closely [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1564.02s)]
*  with the Department of Justice. [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1567.7s)]
*  You actually heard AG, Attorney General Garland, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1569.14s)]
*  say today that they heard from his team really [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1572.34s)]
*  shortly after the discovery. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1576.14s)]
*  And so, you know, I just want to make sure that this is understood, [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1578.1s)]
*  that he takes this very seriously. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1581.62s)]
*  So speaking of taking this seriously, this is the kind of thing [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1583.3799999999999s)]
*  that can cause government employees to lose their security clearance. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1586.3799999999999s)]
*  This is a serious matter, as the White House has said. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1588.74s)]
*  Was the president sloppy in his handling of classified material [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1591.58s)]
*  after multiple locations where classified documents are being found? [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1594.06s)]
*  Look, I said this in my, I said that in the statement, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1596.78s)]
*  it's in the statement from his lawyer, Richard Sauber. [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1598.98s)]
*  And at the end, he said, we are confident that they are thorough review. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1602.2199999999998s)]
*  We'll show that these documents were inadvertently misplaced. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1605.66s)]
*  And the president and his lawyers acted promptly [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1608.98s)]
*  upon discovery of this mistake. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1611.18s)]
*  I'm going to leave it there. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1613.42s)]
*  That's what his lawyer said. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1614.46s)]
*  But again, this is something that the president takes very seriously. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1615.9s)]
*  And we have been coordinating. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1618.9s)]
*  They have been coordinating. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1621.38s)]
*  His lawyers have been coordinating very closely [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1622.46s)]
*  with the Department of Justice. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1624.74s)]
*  The last thing is, the initial statement of the White House [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1625.7s)]
*  came out on Monday. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1627.0600000000002s)]
*  The president addressed this on Tuesday in Mexico City. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1628.1000000000001s)]
*  All the conversations about the documents in the office. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1630.46s)]
*  However, according to the attorney general, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1632.5800000000002s)]
*  the documents were found on December 20 in his garage in Wilmington. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1634.34s)]
*  Why was that not immediately addressed? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1637.1799999999998s)]
*  Is the White House being transparent about that, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1638.82s)]
*  if that was already known and not discussed up front? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1640.34s)]
*  So just to, you said transparent. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1643.06s)]
*  I want to say that we have been transparent here. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1645.3799999999999s)]
*  That is why the minute that his lawyers found those documents, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1648.02s)]
*  they reported it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1652.4599999999998s)]
*  They reached out to the archives of the Department of Justice. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1653.62s)]
*  And they did that voluntarily. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1656.4599999999998s)]
*  And they were not compelled to do it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1659.06s)]
*  They did it voluntarily. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1660.6999999999998s)]
*  Now, I want to step back a little bit, as you're [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1662.1s)]
*  asking me about the timeline. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1663.82s)]
*  Look, the lawyers said we have been working closely [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1665.02s)]
*  with the Department of Justice and coordinating [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1667.34s)]
*  a search that was still ongoing to ensure any additional documents were [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1669.26s)]
*  in the proper possession of the government. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1673.82s)]
*  After that search, after the search concluded last night, [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1676.34s)]
*  we released a statement disclosing the facts from that search, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1681.1s)]
*  as you all know, this morning. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1684.22s)]
*  This is all part of the Justice Department process. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1686.1799999999998s)]
*  And you heard the attorney general speak to this today. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1688.82s)]
*  So we are being very careful to be fully cooperative [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1692.54s)]
*  with the Department of Justice and providing details [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1696.54s)]
*  as appropriate as part of that process. [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1699.5s)]
*  So why did you fully describe the documents when [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1702.1s)]
*  you were first asked at this point? [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1704.6599999999999s)]
*  Because, and I actually answered that question. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1706.42s)]
*  I said because there was a process happening that was currently ongoing. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1708.7s)]
*  And I'll refer you back to my comments that I made just yesterday. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1712.26s)]
*  Go ahead, Mary. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1715.62s)]
*  Just a couple things I want to clarify, just to make sure [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1716.5s)]
*  that our reporting is as accurate as possible. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1718.26s)]
*  The special counsels, the White House counsels, statement this morning [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1720.66s)]
*  said that documents were found in the president's Wilmington residence [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1724.74s)]
*  garage and in an adjacent room. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1727.78s)]
*  But when the president mentioned this himself in person earlier, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1729.8200000000002s)]
*  he said they were found in storage areas and in his personal library. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1732.7s)]
*  So can you just clear this up? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1736.22s)]
*  Which room, where were the documents actually found in his residence? [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1737.46s)]
*  OK, so let me just step back, because I know all of you [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1739.9s)]
*  will have a lot of questions. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1742.1000000000001s)]
*  So I'll lay this out very clearly and precisely. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1743.46s)]
*  I don't want, clearly, we want to make sure no one is confused, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1746.46s)]
*  as you just said, Mary. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1749.14s)]
*  As soon as the president's lawyers found these documents, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1750.06s)]
*  they immediately contacted archives and Department of Justice, [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1752.1799999999998s)]
*  as I've said many times already, to ensure that they were handled properly. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1754.6799999999998s)]
*  The president has said this. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1757.98s)]
*  We are being fully cooperative with the Department of Justice [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1759.58s)]
*  throughout this process as part of the president's lawyers [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1762.78s)]
*  look through the places where documents could have been stored [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1766.3s)]
*  and the counsel's office released, as you said, a statement explaining that. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1769.94s)]
*  So I would refer you back to the statement. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1773.54s)]
*  I don't have anything more to say. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1775.3s)]
*  But that search was completed last night. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1776.7s)]
*  And now this is in the hands of the Justice Department. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1779.66s)]
*  So look, I want to be very prudent here, as I said yesterday, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1782.7s)]
*  as you all have reported over and over again. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1785.98s)]
*  So about any questions about this, any specifics, there's a review going on. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1788.8200000000002s)]
*  And I would refer you to Department of Justice or my colleagues [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1793.78s)]
*  in the counsel's office. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1796.6200000000001s)]
*  But again, I'm just not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1798.02s)]
*  We just laid out the process that was taken. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1800.66s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying we should go off [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1804.02s)]
*  of the counsel's statement saying it was found in the garage [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1805.6200000000001s)]
*  in an adjacent room. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1807.8200000000002s)]
*  I'm just saying I'm not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1809.7s)]
*  I'm not going to. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1812.66s)]
*  What the president is saying is completely different from the counsel. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1813.3s)]
*  Mary, I completely understand. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1815.22s)]
*  I just want to be very careful because there is an ongoing investigation. [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1816.94s)]
*  I want to be prudent here and make sure if you have any additional questions [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1821.42s)]
*  about where things were found, again, I refer you to the statement. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1825.82s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1829.3s)]
*  And one other point of clarification. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1831.3s)]
*  The president said Tuesday he was surprised [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1832.66s)]
*  to learn about the documents at the Penn-Biden Center [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1834.5s)]
*  that he didn't know what was in these documents. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1836.78s)]
*  He didn't repeat that this morning about the documents found at his residence. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1839.22s)]
*  So was he also surprised to learn that there were classified documents [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1842.7s)]
*  at his residence? [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1845.98s)]
*  And does he know any information about what's in them? [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1846.7s)]
*  Again, he was surprised that the documents were there. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1849.78s)]
*  And that is also in line with what we shared this morning. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1854.1s)]
*  And again, he takes this very seriously when [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1859.3799999999999s)]
*  it comes to classified information, when it comes to classified documents. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1861.22s)]
*  And again, it still stays the same. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1866.18s)]
*  He was surprised that the records were found. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1867.66s)]
*  He does not know what's in them. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1869.7800000000002s)]
*  That has not changed. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1871.42s)]
*  And again, his team, when they identified that they were there, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1872.9s)]
*  they immediately reached out to the archives, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1878.46s)]
*  reached out to DOJ just as they did last night [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1880.38s)]
*  and as we have pretty much laid out previously. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1883.6200000000001s)]
*  And one more, just because much has been made of the differences here [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1886.6200000000001s)]
*  between what you all have handled these documents and the way [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1889.42s)]
*  that the former president handled documents [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1892.42s)]
*  that were taken from the White House. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1894.3799999999999s)]
*  When the FBI went, sorry Garland said, when the FBI went to the location [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1896.3799999999999s)]
*  being the president's residence and secured these documents, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1899.62s)]
*  did the FBI just retrieve documents or was there a search of the residence? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1903.74s)]
*  Again, I'm just not going to go into the particulars [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1907.78s)]
*  or the specifics of what the Department of Justice did. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1910.6999999999998s)]
*  I can speak to what we have done and what is already out there. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1913.5s)]
*  We laid out a statement pretty extensively on Monday. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1917.86s)]
*  We've been laid out a statement this morning on what was found last night. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1920.6599999999999s)]
*  I'm just not going to go beyond. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1925.5s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1927.2199999999998s)]
*  to give you the specifics on that. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1929.4199999999998s)]
*  As you know, there's an ongoing process. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1931.6999999999998s)]
*  There's a review currently occurring. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1933.3799999999999s)]
*  Got you. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1935.34s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1935.86s)]
*  OK, great. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1936.3799999999999s)]
*  Can you shed any light on how the documents got to these places and why? [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1937.58s)]
*  Again, there's an ongoing process. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1942.6999999999998s)]
*  It's being reviewed. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1944.1399999999999s)]
*  Don't have more to share. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1946.5s)]
*  I'm going to let the Department of Justice answer any questions [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1947.58s)]
*  as they're looking at this. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1951.18s)]
*  Does the White House think that the appointment of a special prosecutor [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1952.6599999999999s)]
*  was warranted? [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1955.86s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the decisions that [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1957.26s)]
*  was made by the attorney general. [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1960.42s)]
*  I will say this, and you've heard me say this many times before. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1961.86s)]
*  This is a president that believes in the independence of the Justice [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1965.42s)]
*  Department. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1969.18s)]
*  This is something that he has been saying since the campaign. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1969.68s)]
*  And you've heard me say this over and over in restoring that independence. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1972.62s)]
*  So look, we have been very, very careful here [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1977.5s)]
*  not to appear from the White House to influence their decision [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1980.5s)]
*  making on any number of issues. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1983.38s)]
*  As you've heard me say over and over again, I've said this many times. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1988.14s)]
*  I'm sure someone has counted the amount of times [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1991.7s)]
*  that I've said that the Department of Justice is independent [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1993.7800000000002s)]
*  and we respect their independence. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1996.3400000000001s)]
*  I am certainly not going to comment or give my opinion. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=1997.8200000000002s)]
*  Are we going to give our opinion on what the attorney general laid [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2004.5400000000002s)]
*  out today? [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2007.3s)]
*  What broadly does the White House make of comparisons [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2007.8s)]
*  between President Biden's handling of documents [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2011.1s)]
*  and former President Trump's handling? [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2015.3799999999999s)]
*  I'm not going to get into politics from here. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2017.02s)]
*  What I can say is what I've laid out, which is the president [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2018.8999999999999s)]
*  takes this very seriously. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2022.22s)]
*  He does. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2023.82s)]
*  He said this twice. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2024.3799999999999s)]
*  And he did not know that the records were there when they were found. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2025.98s)]
*  He does not know what's in them. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2031.18s)]
*  And what he did and what his team did is the minute [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2033.1s)]
*  they realized that the documents were there, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2036.4599999999998s)]
*  they reached out to the archives, they reached out [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2039.22s)]
*  to the Department of Justice. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2041.1799999999998s)]
*  And I'll just leave it there and I'll leave you all to pontificate [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2042.5s)]
*  and do your punditry. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2047.1799999999998s)]
*  I will not do that from here. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2048.34s)]
*  Thanks, Kareem. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2049.94s)]
*  In the statement from the special counsel [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2050.66s)]
*  that the second set of documents that the lawyers completed [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2051.98s)]
*  the ongoing review by the president's legal team last night, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2054.46s)]
*  does that mean there are no other locations where [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2059.94s)]
*  documents could be stored? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2061.9s)]
*  There's no other search underway at this moment in time [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2062.94s)]
*  for documents from the vice president's side. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2065.42s)]
*  So as I'm just going to, again, that statement pretty much lays it out. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2067.34s)]
*  That they have, as part of the lawyers, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2072.26s)]
*  they look through the places where documents could have been stored. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2077.02s)]
*  And the counsel's office released a statement on that. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2080.82s)]
*  Now it is in the hands of the special counsel. [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2083.9s)]
*  So we should assume that it's been completed? [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2086.1800000000003s)]
*  You should assume that it's been completed, yes. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2088.34s)]
*  OK, and I just want to square something that Chris was asking about. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2090.3s)]
*  The review was underway when you guys gave a detailed statement [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2093.1s)]
*  about the first set of documents. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2095.9s)]
*  The review was underway when the president spoke [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2097.62s)]
*  about the first set of documents. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2099.66s)]
*  You're now saying that you didn't talk about the second set [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2101.14s)]
*  of documents discovered almost a month prior [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2103.42s)]
*  because the review was underway. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2106.18s)]
*  I don't understand. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2108.7799999999997s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2109.46s)]
*  The review was underway the entire time. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2110.5s)]
*  The only difference was that reporters had information [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2112.02s)]
*  on the first set of documents. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2114.7s)]
*  And therefore, you chose to exclude the second set of documents [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2115.82s)]
*  until reporters got information on the second set of documents. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2118.2999999999997s)]
*  Well, let me unconfuse you for a second, Phil. [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2120.7s)]
*  Look, we are trying to do this by the book. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2122.62s)]
*  And I said yesterday this was under review [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2124.98s)]
*  by the Department of Justice. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2128.02s)]
*  And the process is as such. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2129.9s)]
*  When the president's lawyers realized that the documents existed, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2132.42s)]
*  that they were there, they reached out to the archives. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2137.18s)]
*  They reached out to the Department of Justice. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2140.62s)]
*  Rightfully so, may I add. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2142.58s)]
*  That is what you're supposed to do as lawyers. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2144.2999999999997s)]
*  That's what they did. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2146.94s)]
*  And they have fully been cooperating [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2148.22s)]
*  with the Department of Justice. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2151.4599999999996s)]
*  And again, I said this earlier in answering a question. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2153.7799999999997s)]
*  You heard from the attorney general. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2156.98s)]
*  He said shortly after the documents were discovered [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2158.3799999999997s)]
*  that we did outreach, the president's lawyers [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2162.8199999999997s)]
*  did outreach to the Department of Justice and archives. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2165.06s)]
*  Don't be questioning that. [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2168.74s)]
*  That's not what we're asking about. [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2169.8999999999996s)]
*  We're asking about. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2170.98s)]
*  I'm telling you that there's a process. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2171.7799999999997s)]
*  I just laid out what the process is. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2173.2999999999997s)]
*  And I'm telling you that we were trying [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2175.1s)]
*  to do this by the book. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2177.02s)]
*  And it was an ongoing process. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2178.2599999999998s)]
*  I'm not going to get beyond that. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2181.34s)]
*  But that is how this works. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2183.5s)]
*  How can you say this was transparent [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2186.22s)]
*  when you settled this information for more than two [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2188.46s)]
*  months? [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2190.54s)]
*  Thank you, Karine. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2191.9s)]
*  We are seeking information. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2193.74s)]
*  And I appreciate and understand why the press office can only [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2196.78s)]
*  say so much. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2199.5s)]
*  So help us understand this. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2200.1s)]
*  Who are the president's personal counsel [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2201.74s)]
*  that the attorney general referred to today? [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2204.86s)]
*  I was asked that question earlier. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2207.9s)]
*  Let me get back to you. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2209.46s)]
*  I actually don't have that answer. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2210.6200000000003s)]
*  I think I know who it is, but I want to make 100% career. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2212.7000000000003s)]
*  Bob Bauer is one, potentially Theda Remus, James Garland, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2215.6200000000003s)]
*  Robert Leonard. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2218.86s)]
*  Are they the ones that have been contracted [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2219.86s)]
*  in the Justice Department? [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2221.6200000000003s)]
*  Look, again, I want to say the right thing from here. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2222.6200000000003s)]
*  So I would have talked to the White House counsel, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2226.3s)]
*  or you would have to reach out to the White House counsel [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2229.34s)]
*  to talk about who is his personal lawyers. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2231.7400000000002s)]
*  To button this up, the first set of documents [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2233.98s)]
*  were found in November at the Penn Biden Center [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2237.06s)]
*  here in Washington. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2238.94s)]
*  Why did it take until yesterday and until this morning, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2240.3s)]
*  apparently, for whoever it was to inform Robert Lausch [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2244.46s)]
*  that that final document was found? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2248.14s)]
*  Was that because there were press reports earlier this week? [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2250.7400000000002s)]
*  Again, there's [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2253.7400000000002s)]
*  And the hope was that nobody would find out? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2254.5s)]
*  Again. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2256.22s)]
*  Or was it because? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2256.7s)]
*  There is a process, an ongoing process that is occurring. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2257.46s)]
*  We did this by the book. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2260.92s)]
*  And what I mean by that is the moment [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2263.06s)]
*  that the lawyers discovered that the papers were there [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2265.54s)]
*  or the documents were there, they [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2268.1s)]
*  reached out to the archives, they reached out [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2270.18s)]
*  to the Department of Justice, and they immediately, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2272.42s)]
*  rightfully so, reached out to them [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2274.7799999999997s)]
*  to let them know what they had discovered. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2277.74s)]
*  And that is the process. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2280.38s)]
*  That is what his lawyers did. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2282.62s)]
*  And again, it's an ongoing process. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2286.04s)]
*  As you stated in your question, I am limited in what I can say. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2288.2599999999998s)]
*  It is now in the hands of the Department of Justice. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2291.86s)]
*  They are reviewing this. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2294.58s)]
*  As you know, the special counsel was announced [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2295.54s)]
*  by the attorney general. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2297.34s)]
*  And so I will leave it there. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2298.58s)]
*  What was the president trying to say [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2300.3s)]
*  when he referenced his Corvette earlier today? [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2301.94s)]
*  Because it sounded like he was implying [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2304.54s)]
*  that because his garage is a safe place for his car, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2306.7000000000003s)]
*  the documents were safe. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2309.98s)]
*  And therefore, if it was safe for the car, [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2313.46s)]
*  it was safe for the documents. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2315.6600000000003s)]
*  Is that what he meant? [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2316.7400000000002s)]
*  Look, I am going to just leave his statement as is. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2317.5s)]
*  Your colleague was having a back and forth with the president. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2322.02s)]
*  You can read the transcript of what was asked of him [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2325.06s)]
*  and why he responded that way. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2327.26s)]
*  I'm just not going to get into specifics. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2328.6200000000003s)]
*  You talk about we are being transparent. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2330.34s)]
*  Who is we and what is the definition [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2335.78s)]
*  of transparent in this case? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2337.7400000000002s)]
*  Is it the lawyers being transparent legally [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2338.94s)]
*  with the archives and the Justice Department, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2341.58s)]
*  or is it the White House writ large [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2343.9s)]
*  being transparent with the general public? [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2345.26s)]
*  So number one, and I've said this multiple times already, [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2347.42s)]
*  we take this very seriously. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2351.32s)]
*  The president takes this very seriously. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2352.8s)]
*  He was not aware that the records were there. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2354.88s)]
*  He does not know what is in the documents. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2357.7200000000003s)]
*  Again, classified information, classified documents, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2361.32s)]
*  he takes very seriously. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2364.84s)]
*  When they were discovered, and this is the right thing to do, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2366.28s)]
*  his lawyers reached out immediately to the archivists. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2371.4s)]
*  They reached out to the Department of Justice [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2375.6400000000003s)]
*  to let them know that the papers or the documents [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2377.48s)]
*  were being taken out by the archivists. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2380.32s)]
*  The archivists or the Justice Department? [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2382.1600000000003s)]
*  Because the attorney general this morning [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2383.84s)]
*  said that the attorneys reached out to the archives. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2385.4s)]
*  It was only later in December when [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2387.6000000000004s)]
*  the second batch was apparently done. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2389.88s)]
*  But then they were reaching out to the Justice Department. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2391.52s)]
*  I will leave it to what the Department of Justice [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2393.36s)]
*  is laying out. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2395.6000000000004s)]
*  What we are saying that we reached out to the archivists, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2396.44s)]
*  we reached out to the Department of Justice. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2399.28s)]
*  That is what is the right thing to do in this case. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2401.0800000000004s)]
*  And so I can finish here. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2404.84s)]
*  In this as well is that the White House counsel [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2408.92s)]
*  has laid out in detail on Monday to all of you. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2411.6s)]
*  But they haven't looked at everything, Corrine, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2416.52s)]
*  and you know that. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2417.36s)]
*  First of all, I can't talk about this, right? [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2418.48s)]
*  Because the Department of Justice is reviewing it. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2421.44s)]
*  There is a review happening, Ed. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2424.0s)]
*  You know this. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2426.6400000000003s)]
*  We just heard from the attorney general. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2427.6400000000003s)]
*  There is a review. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2429.48s)]
*  I am limited in what I can say to this. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2430.48s)]
*  Richard Sauber perhaps come here? [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2432.92s)]
*  I think you should reach out to the White House counsel. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2434.76s)]
*  They are reaching out on a constant basis. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2438.88s)]
*  Okay. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2440.28s)]
*  I am saying to you that we have put out lengthy statements [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2441.28s)]
*  and you can reach out to them as you all have been doing. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2445.0s)]
*  And I will leave it there. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2448.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2449.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2450.36s)]
*  Go ahead, Justice. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2451.36s)]
*  Why not have them come and answer the questions? [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2452.36s)]
*  They have been talking to you all pretty regularly [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2454.32s)]
*  the last couple of days. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2457.6400000000003s)]
*  We have put out, they have put out lengthy statements on this. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2459.6600000000003s)]
*  I just read out what Richard Sauber had to say. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2462.88s)]
*  And I would refer you to the White House counsel. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2466.56s)]
*  I am limited in what I can say because the Department of Justice, [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2468.46s)]
*  we see them as being independent when it comes to these types of issues. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2473.38s)]
*  And so I am not going to go beyond what the President said [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2477.86s)]
*  and I am not going to go beyond what the lawyers say. [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2481.26s)]
*  I have to go around. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2483.34s)]
*  You have asked me about, you have asked me, Ed. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2484.34s)]
*  There is going to be a limit in transparency, public, non-legal transparency [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2486.34s)]
*  and what can be shared and said by this White House. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2491.3s)]
*  I disagree. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2493.06s)]
*  There has, I disagree, Ed. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2494.06s)]
*  There has not been a limit of transparency. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2495.06s)]
*  That is, that is, that is, there has not been a limit of transparency. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2497.54s)]
*  That I will disagree with you on that. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2501.7s)]
*  Justin. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2504.46s)]
*  Thanks, Karin. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2505.46s)]
*  I did want to kind of follow up on what Ed and Phil were asking, [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2506.46s)]
*  which is putting aside the question of whether the President's lawyers [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2509.98s)]
*  acted properly and handing the documents over. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2513.46s)]
*  There's this lingering question of why there wasn't an acknowledgement [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2516.66s)]
*  of the second set of documents earlier this week. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2519.66s)]
*  And you said that you're working through a process and going by the book. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2522.78s)]
*  What I'm curious is if you're trying to sort of hint at the idea [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2526.62s)]
*  that the Justice Department asked you not to reveal the second set of documents [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2531.02s)]
*  or you were told in some way not to disclose anything [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2534.46s)]
*  that had not been made public. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2537.66s)]
*  I would not jump to those two conclusions. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2538.9s)]
*  That is not what I'm stating. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2541.2599999999998s)]
*  I am genuinely saying to you there is an ongoing process [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2542.38s)]
*  that we are going to follow. [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2546.2599999999998s)]
*  And I am limited in what I can say from here. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2547.86s)]
*  That is why my White House counsel colleagues are the, we refer to them. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2550.5s)]
*  These past couple of days, now this is in the hands of the Department of Justice, [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2555.22s)]
*  as you all heard from the Attorney General himself. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2558.46s)]
*  I think I guess I remain confused if the Justice Department didn't ask you [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2562.2999999999997s)]
*  not to disclose these documents. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2567.46s)]
*  Why on Monday, as this news was coming out Tuesday, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2569.5s)]
*  as the President was talking about it, you didn't say, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2573.3799999999997s)]
*  here's everything we know at this point. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2576.2599999999998s)]
*  The first set was found at the Penn-Biden Center. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2579.02s)]
*  The second set was founded. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2582.06s)]
*  His office were searching to make sure that there's nothing else. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2583.9s)]
*  Because there's an ongoing process, and you heard directly [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2587.26s)]
*  from the Attorney General today. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2589.6600000000003s)]
*  And that is the process. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2591.3s)]
*  That is how this is going to go. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2592.9s)]
*  It is not going to come from here, from me at this podium. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2594.94s)]
*  It is going to come from the Department of Justice. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2598.42s)]
*  And that is just the process that's happening currently. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2600.34s)]
*  I feel slightly bad about chasing Kirby from the room, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2602.9s)]
*  so I'm going to ask you one thing not about the Special Counselate, which is... [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2605.06s)]
*  What? [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2607.78s)]
*  No, now you can't. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2608.3s)]
*  You can't now ask a question that you could have asked to Kirby. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2609.1s)]
*  Well, it wasn't for Kirby. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2611.9s)]
*  It was for you. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2612.9s)]
*  You got a question yesterday actually about Moderna, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2614.3s)]
*  raising the prices of the COVID vaccine, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2617.38s)]
*  and said that you'd take the question. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2619.42s)]
*  I was wondering if you had a problem. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2620.86s)]
*  And I did. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2621.5s)]
*  I actually did. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2621.98s)]
*  And Michael is not here. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2622.6200000000003s)]
*  I was going to provide this information to him today. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2623.5800000000004s)]
*  So first, I don't want anybody to be confused here. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2627.7400000000002s)]
*  As you know, this is incredibly important. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2630.46s)]
*  So you can go to 90,000 locations and get a Moderna or any COVID-19 shot for free. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2632.5400000000004s)]
*  That is currently what folks can do. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2639.34s)]
*  And they are our best protection against the XBB 1.5 right now. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2641.42s)]
*  So please, if you haven't, please go get your shot. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2646.7000000000003s)]
*  As you've heard from me, as you've heard from our COVID-19 team here, [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2649.3s)]
*  has been very clear on why this is important [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2654.1400000000003s)]
*  and why folks should get their shots. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2656.58s)]
*  As it relates to the question, what Senator Sanders is talking about [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2659.2200000000003s)]
*  is future shots and the process of moving forward, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2662.7000000000003s)]
*  moving toward a commercial market for COVID shots. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2666.58s)]
*  So we share this concern that those shots should be affordable. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2669.86s)]
*  That is something that we share the concern with Senator Sanders. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2674.02s)]
*  The price hike here is hard to understand or to justify. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2678.6200000000003s)]
*  Again, we do have those concerns as well. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2684.02s)]
*  And we believe that shot should be affordable. [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2687.26s)]
*  Go ahead, Tam. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2688.82s)]
*  A couple of basic geography questions you may not be able to answer. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2689.9s)]
*  But is the library a room adjacent to the garage? [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2692.7000000000003s)]
*  Again, I don't have any of this information that I can provide. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2697.94s)]
*  This is under review. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2702.7400000000002s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2705.54s)]
*  I'm just not going to go into specifics here, [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2708.94s)]
*  not something that I can do from here. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2711.18s)]
*  And is the president's corvette stored in the garage [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2712.82s)]
*  where the documents were found, just for pure fact purposes? [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2716.02s)]
*  I will basically repeat what the president said. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2719.3s)]
*  His corvette is in the garage. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2722.06s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond what the president said. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2723.38s)]
*  On the transparency issue, would you admit that earlier this week, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2726.14s)]
*  the White House shared incomplete information? [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2733.62s)]
*  I think that when we all heard Merrick Garland say [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2736.38s)]
*  that these documents of the residents were found on December 20th [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2738.74s)]
*  that they were notified, that was pretty surprising to all of us [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2742.46s)]
*  based on the statements that you and the president [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2745.22s)]
*  and the council's office had made. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2747.7799999999997s)]
*  Well, as I just said, as you saw in our statement, [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2749.62s)]
*  the documents were found last night. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2752.58s)]
*  They completed the search with documents being found last night. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2755.74s)]
*  And then this morning, we put out, you heard from the White House Council, [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2760.7799999999997s)]
*  we put out the information on specifically what was found. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2765.58s)]
*  But just one document was found last night. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2768.86s)]
*  The search was continuing. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2771.3s)]
*  It was ongoing. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2772.54s)]
*  The process, as I've been saying, was ongoing. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2773.66s)]
*  And the search is clearly complete, and therefore, we [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2776.1s)]
*  shared the information with all of you. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2778.94s)]
*  Again, this is an ongoing process. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2780.94s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice on any other specifics [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2782.82s)]
*  or particulars, even on timeline, any other questions that you have. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2785.7000000000003s)]
*  Does Biden come in here to address the treatment? [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2790.38s)]
*  Right here. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2792.66s)]
*  I'm going to come back. [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2794.42s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2795.38s)]
*  Just a follow-up to a couple of questions. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2796.38s)]
*  But is the president confident? [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2800.06s)]
*  You said that the search has been completed. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2801.86s)]
*  But is the president confident that there are no additional documents [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2803.66s)]
*  with classified markings that remain in any other additional locations? [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2806.9s)]
*  I can just refer you to what his team said. [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2811.2999999999997s)]
*  The search is complete. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2813.2999999999997s)]
*  He is confident in this process. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2815.14s)]
*  And I will leave it there. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2817.14s)]
*  And they've been cooperating very closely with the Department of Justice. [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2818.38s)]
*  And we've gotten a statement that the White House did not [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2821.5s)]
*  get advance notice that Garland was appointing a special counsel. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2823.8199999999997s)]
*  That is correct. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2826.54s)]
*  When did the president learn? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2827.38s)]
*  How did he learn? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2829.06s)]
*  Was it from the press conference? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2830.7s)]
*  Did he get a heads up before that? [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2832.02s)]
*  We learned from the press conference. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2834.02s)]
*  The president, we were not giving a heads up. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2836.5s)]
*  And we learned from the press conference. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2838.8599999999997s)]
*  He was in a funeral at the time. [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2840.14s)]
*  When did somebody tell him? [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2841.5s)]
*  Look, he was at a funeral, to your point. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2843.3799999999997s)]
*  Maybe one of his senior advisors may have told him. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2845.42s)]
*  I actually don't know specifically when he knew. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2848.2999999999997s)]
*  But what I can say to you, we were not giving a heads up. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2850.46s)]
*  That I can confirm, as you all know already. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2853.46s)]
*  And have you had a chance to talk to him since then? [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2855.2999999999997s)]
*  No. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2857.46s)]
*  I have not had a chance to talk to the president about this or his reaction. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2858.5s)]
*  Does the White House feel like House Republicans [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2863.8199999999997s)]
*  have a right to conduct an investigation on documents issue? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2866.86s)]
*  They've, of course, started sending requests and saying [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2871.34s)]
*  they're going to look into this. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2873.42s)]
*  Does that fall in the realm of legitimate requests [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2875.42s)]
*  from House Republicans right now? [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2878.86s)]
*  Look, I'm not going to speak to what the House Republicans decide to do. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2880.6600000000003s)]
*  What I can speak to is that we are, the president's lawyers, is complying. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2883.6600000000003s)]
*  And they are working on this with the Department of Justice. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2888.46s)]
*  As they have been, again, this is something [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2892.1800000000003s)]
*  that the president takes very seriously. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2894.06s)]
*  When it comes to classified information, [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2895.82s)]
*  when it comes to classified documents, I'm just not [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2897.3s)]
*  going to go into what the Republicans on the House do or don't do. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2899.34s)]
*  Sorry, just separate from this. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2904.46s)]
*  I was wondering if the White House had any thought on the Senate [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2906.26s)]
*  primary in California that's shaping up. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2909.1800000000003s)]
*  So as you know, the president sees Senator Feinstein [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2911.5800000000004s)]
*  as a long time friend and also a colleague who he deeply respects [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2916.34s)]
*  and has collaborated on historic pieces of legislations over the years. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2921.2200000000003s)]
*  And such as the last federal ban on assault weapons. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2925.38s)]
*  So he respects the talented officials in California [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2930.1400000000003s)]
*  who are expressing interest in running for her seat. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2933.5s)]
*  And we are prohibited from here, as you know, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2936.5s)]
*  about talking about campaigns or elections, not something [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2939.1400000000003s)]
*  that I can do from the podium. [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2942.46s)]
*  So it would be inappropriate for me to weigh in with more specifics [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2943.86s)]
*  on any forthcoming Senate race, including the one in California. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2947.38s)]
*  But clearly, he sees her as a long time friend and colleague. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2952.2599999999998s)]
*  Good. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2955.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the president, when he was in Mexico City [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2956.18s)]
*  and asked about the classified documents [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2958.8999999999996s)]
*  that were found in the private office at the Pinn-Biden Center, [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2961.7799999999997s)]
*  said that he didn't know what the documents contained [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2965.5s)]
*  or what was in them. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2969.54s)]
*  Is that the case also with the documents found at his Wilmington [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2970.3799999999997s)]
*  residence that he doesn't know what those documents involved? [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2975.22s)]
*  Yeah, I already answered the question, and he does not know. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2979.3399999999997s)]
*  He's not aware of that the documents, the records were there. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2981.78s)]
*  I'll come over. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2986.3s)]
*  Sorry, could you just clarify a little bit more [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2987.02s)]
*  about when you say that we inform the archives [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2988.98s)]
*  meeting of the Department of Justice immediately, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2991.1800000000003s)]
*  since this happens in various points in time, [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2993.1800000000003s)]
*  what exactly was said at which juncture, [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2995.38s)]
*  because it seems to be there's some conflict there. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2997.26s)]
*  Look, again, I will refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=2999.7000000000003s)]
*  What I can tell you is that his lawyers reached out [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3002.28s)]
*  to the archivist, to the Department of Justice, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3005.6200000000003s)]
*  which is what you're supposed to do, which [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3007.7400000000002s)]
*  is the right thing to do. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3009.7400000000002s)]
*  I'm not going to get into specifics of who they reached [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3011.22s)]
*  out to first. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3015.18s)]
*  I would refer you to the White House counsel [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3015.8399999999997s)]
*  to get more specifics. [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3017.68s)]
*  It is an ongoing process. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3018.98s)]
*  And I would, again, refer to either the White House [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3021.4199999999996s)]
*  counsel or the Department of Justice [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3023.62s)]
*  for that specific question. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3024.8199999999997s)]
*  Go ahead, Kristen. [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3026.18s)]
*  Just a couple of outstanding clarifications [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3027.02s)]
*  before I get to questions. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3029.06s)]
*  Salvers said there were documents in the garage [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3031.06s)]
*  and one document in an adjacent room. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3033.1s)]
*  Merrick Garland said the DOJ was informed of one [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3035.74s)]
*  additional document this morning. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3039.02s)]
*  Is that the same document, an additional document [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3040.94s)]
*  and the document found in the adjacent room? [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3043.34s)]
*  So let me just say, during the review, [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3045.2200000000003s)]
*  and this is so that folks know, the lawyers discovered [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3046.9s)]
*  among personal and political papers [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3050.06s)]
*  a small number of additional Obama-Biden administration [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3051.68s)]
*  records with classified markings. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3054.26s)]
*  All but one of these documents were found in storage space [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3056.3s)]
*  in the president's Wilmington residence garage. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3059.02s)]
*  One document consisting of one page [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3063.02s)]
*  was discovered among stored materials in an adjacent room. [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3065.18s)]
*  No documents were found in the Rehoboth Beach House. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3068.32s)]
*  I just want to underscore that this is something, again, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3070.94s)]
*  that the president takes very seriously. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3074.82s)]
*  It underscores how we executed the search with the DOJ [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3079.1000000000004s)]
*  to make sure that they continued cooperating fully [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3083.5400000000004s)]
*  with the review. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3087.5800000000004s)]
*  And I think that is what we are trying to be very clear about, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3088.6200000000003s)]
*  is that we have been, the president's lawyers, [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3092.82s)]
*  has been cooperating fully. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3096.1600000000003s)]
*  I'm not going to get into the specifics as to, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3098.7000000000003s)]
*  you have the statement, I would refer you [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3101.7400000000002s)]
*  to the president's lawyer or anything else specifically [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3103.7000000000003s)]
*  on this or the Department of Justice, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3106.3s)]
*  because they are actually reviewing this currently. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3107.9s)]
*  Or, could you go back to something [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3110.06s)]
*  we were trying to pin down yesterday? [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3111.46s)]
*  Can you tell us today, when did the president find out [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3112.96s)]
*  initially about that first batch of documents [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3115.98s)]
*  and then the second batch? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3118.06s)]
*  Our reporting says he was told on November 2nd. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3118.94s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3121.1s)]
*  So what I can say to you is that the president has been kept [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3121.82s)]
*  informed by his counsel throughout this process. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3128.22s)]
*  I don't have a specific date, but I [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3131.58s)]
*  can tell you that the president was kept informed throughout. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3133.98s)]
*  Don't have a timeline to share for you right now. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3137.9399999999996s)]
*  Again, this is under ongoing review. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3140.4599999999996s)]
*  And so I want to be careful and prudent of what [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3143.1s)]
*  I share here at the podium. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3145.1s)]
*  Can you tell us when the search started [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3146.4599999999996s)]
*  and why they were searching in the first place? [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3147.5s)]
*  Was the president concerned that there [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3149.58s)]
*  may be classified documents? [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3150.9599999999996s)]
*  Did someone tip them off? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3152.3399999999997s)]
*  What sparked this? [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3153.7799999999997s)]
*  Again, I'm just not going to go into details from here. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3154.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm not going to go into specifics from here. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3157.7s)]
*  This is an under going on. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3159.98s)]
*  This review is continuing, is ongoing. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3162.46s)]
*  I would refer you to Department of Justice. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3164.8999999999996s)]
*  You have said repeatedly, the president [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3166.7799999999997s)]
*  has said he takes classified documents very seriously. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3168.62s)]
*  If that's the case, why were these classified documents [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3171.8199999999997s)]
*  being stored in his garage? [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3174.3799999999997s)]
*  Look, again, and not just me, he has said this. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3176.54s)]
*  You have heard the president say this twice already. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3179.62s)]
*  And he said this before, classified documents [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3182.8199999999997s)]
*  and information. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3185.54s)]
*  He takes that very seriously. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3186.58s)]
*  And you see. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3188.74s)]
*  The garage is an appropriate place [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3189.66s)]
*  to store classified information. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3191.02s)]
*  I'm not going to go into what he thinks or how he feels [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3192.2999999999997s)]
*  about what is currently happening. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3197.9s)]
*  What I can say for sure, when it comes [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3199.2599999999998s)]
*  to this specific issue about classified documents, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3201.42s)]
*  about classified information, he takes that very seriously. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3205.58s)]
*  He did not know, right? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3208.06s)]
*  He did not know the records were there. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3209.74s)]
*  He was surprised that the records were there. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3212.58s)]
*  So let's be very clear. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3215.2599999999998s)]
*  That is something that the president [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3216.22s)]
*  shared with all of you on the world stage [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3217.66s)]
*  and also recently today. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3219.98s)]
*  And so what occurred was, as I've said multiple times [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3222.2599999999998s)]
*  before, is when his team identified [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3227.2999999999997s)]
*  that these records existed, they handed them [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3229.1s)]
*  over to the archivist and also the Department of Justice. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3234.62s)]
*  Just one more, Kareem. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3237.3799999999997s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that the fact that the White House did not [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3238.8999999999996s)]
*  reveal this to the public, despite the fact [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3243.86s)]
*  that you've known about it for months, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3246.2200000000003s)]
*  undercuts the president's promise [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3248.34s)]
*  of being transparent with the American people? [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3249.86s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3252.1s)]
*  They were transparent. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3253.26s)]
*  There was transparency in doing what you're supposed to do [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3254.54s)]
*  when these items were discovered. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3258.82s)]
*  Not with the American people. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3261.1s)]
*  Look, I am here standing in front of you [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3262.7000000000003s)]
*  answering these questions. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3265.6600000000003s)]
*  The president took two questions this week on this. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3267.2200000000003s)]
*  You've heard. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3270.54s)]
*  Wait. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3271.1400000000003s)]
*  Let me just answer. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3271.78s)]
*  You've heard from the White House consul who put out [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3272.94s)]
*  multiple statements on this. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3275.94s)]
*  And so again, this is an ongoing process. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3278.5s)]
*  We want to respect the process. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3281.7400000000002s)]
*  And we have laid out very clearly what occurred. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3284.38s)]
*  And again, don't want to get ahead of this. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3288.86s)]
*  The Department of Justice, you all will get your questions [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3291.3s)]
*  answered from them during this time. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3295.54s)]
*  And so I will just refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3299.7000000000003s)]
*  And now, as you all know, there's a special counsel [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3301.94s)]
*  dealing with this guy. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3303.94s)]
*  Thank you, Corinne. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3304.7400000000002s)]
*  Another one on GarageGate. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3305.58s)]
*  What is the White House trying to hide? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3309.3s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3312.3s)]
*  Someone gave the president a statement [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3314.2200000000003s)]
*  to read on Tuesday that was incomplete at best, [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3317.7400000000002s)]
*  misleading at worst. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3321.42s)]
*  Who? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3323.62s)]
*  So I have read out the president's statement. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3325.54s)]
*  I read it out yesterday and what he said. [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3327.94s)]
*  He said that he respects or he takes classified information [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3330.62s)]
*  and documents very seriously. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3334.62s)]
*  That's what he said. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3336.22s)]
*  He said that he did not know that the records were there. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3337.34s)]
*  He does not know what's in them. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3340.74s)]
*  He said that. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3342.74s)]
*  You heard from him directly on this. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3343.42s)]
*  And his team has been cooperating fully, fully. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3346.22s)]
*  And not only that, again, I'll say this. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3350.54s)]
*  The attorney general said this himself, [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3352.22s)]
*  that he heard from the team shortly after. [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3354.1s)]
*  So we have laid out what has occurred here. [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3356.98s)]
*  You've heard from the White House counsel. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3362.7400000000002s)]
*  I just read the statement from his lawyer. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3364.66s)]
*  And again, we take this very seriously. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3368.46s)]
*  And the president does as well. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3373.06s)]
*  When will the White House release a log of visitors [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3374.7s)]
*  to the Wilmington house? [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3378.18s)]
*  You know, Peter, you've asked this question, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3379.78s)]
*  or as your colleagues have asked this question before, [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3382.5s)]
*  let's not forget what we did. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3384.66s)]
*  We did something here in this White House. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3386.94s)]
*  We instituted something that the last administration got [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3388.86s)]
*  rid of, which is putting out the White House, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3391.98s)]
*  making sure that there was a White House [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3394.9s)]
*  log, extensive White House log. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3396.58s)]
*  So the American people got to see. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3398.38s)]
*  Again, again. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3400.3s)]
*  Well, again, I am telling you, we [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3401.9s)]
*  did something that the last administration got [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3406.1s)]
*  rid of, which is instituting the White House logs. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3408.38s)]
*  Did you ask the last administration [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3411.42s)]
*  why they got rid of the White House logs? [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3412.9s)]
*  OK, let's go. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3414.7000000000003s)]
*  Let's go. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3415.7000000000003s)]
*  Who had access to the equipment? [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3416.7s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3418.5s)]
*  Do we have the records from the Delaware presidents? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3419.0s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3421.3799999999997s)]
*  I was calling the gentleman who wanted [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3421.8999999999996s)]
*  to ask a question that was not related to this. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3423.4199999999996s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3425.54s)]
*  Thanks, Karin. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3426.04s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3426.1s)]
*  I know I'm a little behind the news cycle here, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3426.7s)]
*  but I want to go back to yesterday's op-ed [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3428.2599999999998s)]
*  from the president on big tech regulation. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3430.18s)]
*  In Washington state, we've got the chairs of both Senate [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3434.06s)]
*  and House Commerce Committees. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3437.18s)]
*  And Congresswoman Morris Rogers put out a statement saying, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3439.06s)]
*  essentially, great. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3442.74s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3444.2599999999998s)]
*  Let's put forward this bill that passed her committee almost [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3444.86s)]
*  unanimously last Congress, the Data Privacy Protection Act. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3449.54s)]
*  I just want to know if the president supports and the White [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3453.6200000000003s)]
*  House supports that bill. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3456.08s)]
*  So the president has long called for strong privacy protections. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3457.5s)]
*  That is something that he's been doing and calling for since [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3461.36s)]
*  almost the beginning of his administration. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3464.3s)]
*  We are heartened to see bipartisan cooperation [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3466.0s)]
*  continue on this important issue, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3469.06s)]
*  on this critical issue. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3470.9s)]
*  As the president said in his Wall Street Journal op-ed, [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3472.32s)]
*  as you mentioned, as you were referring [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3474.76s)]
*  to the op-ed that came out, recently Democrats [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3476.5600000000004s)]
*  and Republicans need to come together [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3479.8s)]
*  to pass serious federal protections [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3481.5600000000004s)]
*  for Americans' privacy, including [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3484.0s)]
*  the strongest possible protections for minors. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3485.8s)]
*  That means clear limits on how companies can collect, use, [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3489.0400000000004s)]
*  and share highly personal data. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3492.7200000000003s)]
*  We welcome to your question, we welcome the partnership [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3495.2000000000003s)]
*  of Senator Cantwell, our chairwoman McMorris Rogers, [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3497.7400000000002s)]
*  Congressman Pallone, and others in getting a bipartisan product [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3501.48s)]
*  to the president's desk that protects our privacy [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3505.92s)]
*  and also protects the privacy of our children. [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3509.72s)]
*  We think this is a critical, important issue. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3512.16s)]
*  And again, we'll continue to call for this. [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3514.88s)]
*  The point on that has been specifically [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3516.84s)]
*  the pushback from California lawmakers worried [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3518.88s)]
*  about preempting state laws like California's. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3521.56s)]
*  Does the president believe that it's important to have [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3524.0s)]
*  a strong, like a national standard for data privacy, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3526.12s)]
*  even if it's weaker than individual state laws? [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3529.04s)]
*  So look, I don't have any news to make about specifics [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3531.0s)]
*  of the pieces of the legislation. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3535.28s)]
*  I'll just say this. [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3539.92s)]
*  We look forward to working with both parties and both houses [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3541.24s)]
*  to get privacy and other tech legislation done. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3545.58s)]
*  We think, again, it's important for the protection of privacy [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3549.36s)]
*  is important for Americans across the country, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3554.64s)]
*  but also, let's not forget our children. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3556.92s)]
*  Kareem. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3560.04s)]
*  Was the Corvette searched? [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3560.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3562.12s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3562.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3563.36s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3563.86s)]
*  No more. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3564.36s)]
*  Thank you, Kareem. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3564.86s)]
*  I have a couple of questions here, [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3565.64s)]
*  but I wanted to follow up quickly. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3567.12s)]
*  You have said repeatedly that the president's lawyers did [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3568.76s)]
*  the right thing, but you also said earlier [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3571.4s)]
*  during the briefing of the president's lawyers [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3573.6800000000003s)]
*  immediately reaching out to the National Archives [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3576.12s)]
*  that, quote, they were not compelled to do it. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3578.76s)]
*  They did it voluntarily. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3580.84s)]
*  Is it the position of the White House [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3582.28s)]
*  that legally the president could have just held on to these? [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3584.84s)]
*  That's not what I'm saying. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3588.32s)]
*  I'm saying they did the right thing, period. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3589.08s)]
*  I wouldn't read into it. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3590.6s)]
*  I'm saying that they did the right thing [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3591.7599999999998s)]
*  and they did it voluntarily, because it is the right thing [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3593.56s)]
*  to do when you find these types of documents to indeed reach [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3596.24s)]
*  out to the archivist and reach out [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3600.44s)]
*  to the Department of Justice. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3601.96s)]
*  And outside of that, they have been cooperating very closely [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3604.56s)]
*  with the Department of Justice. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3611.48s)]
*  And rightfully so, they did this. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3613.44s)]
*  But I guess I'm just a little confused, [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3615.6s)]
*  and I want to move on. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3617.2s)]
*  But what did you mean when you said that they were not [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3617.88s)]
*  compelled to do it? [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3620.6400000000003s)]
*  They did it. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3621.92s)]
*  They did it. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3622.52s)]
*  They did the right thing. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3623.12s)]
*  That's it. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3624.32s)]
*  I wouldn't go down into a rabbit hole on this. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3625.56s)]
*  They did the right thing by reaching out [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3628.52s)]
*  to the archivist and to the Department of Justice. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3630.8s)]
*  Does the White House know how many stops [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3633.12s)]
*  these classified documents made before they ended up [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3634.7200000000003s)]
*  in his home in Delaware or in the Biden-Penn office? [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3637.28s)]
*  For instance, can you rule out that there [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3639.96s)]
*  was a third stop between a secure location and the garage? [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3641.6s)]
*  Again, I would refer you to the Department of Justice. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3646.0s)]
*  There was a question that was asked about the visitor logs [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3648.96s)]
*  with regards to folks who have come in and out of the president's [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3652.72s)]
*  home in Delaware. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3655.3s)]
*  Does the administration have any idea [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3656.72s)]
*  between the garage and the Biden-Penn office [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3658.96s)]
*  just how many people could have gotten their hands on this? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3663.6s)]
*  Or are we to assume that the White House doesn't [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3667.28s)]
*  have an estimate that they don't? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3669.84s)]
*  There's an ongoing review on this, [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3671.12s)]
*  and I would refer you to the Department of Justice. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3672.74s)]
*  And then just finally, the president [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3675.12s)]
*  has said that his lawyers have advised him not to ask what [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3679.08s)]
*  was in these classified documents. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3681.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't understand the purpose of that. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3683.48s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3685.08s)]
*  He has back to the old post. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3686.72s)]
*  Because we're trying to do this by the book. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3687.84s)]
*  We're trying to do this in the appropriate way. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3689.68s)]
*  And so that's what I would say to you. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3692.96s)]
*  His team has been complying, cooperating [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3696.68s)]
*  with the Department of Justice. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3700.7999999999997s)]
*  And I will leave it there. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3702.52s)]
*  I'm not going to go beyond. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3703.72s)]
*  The book says that he can't look at this. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3704.6s)]
*  What would compel him or push him in that direction? [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3706.52s)]
*  Because you've said it repeatedly. [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3708.72s)]
*  I guess as he tries to do this by the book, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3710.64s)]
*  as he tries to do the right thing, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3713.44s)]
*  what are his lawyers looking at that says, [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3715.44s)]
*  yeah, don't look at this classified information that [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3717.68s)]
*  was found in the book? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3719.64s)]
*  Again, there's a process here. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3719.84s)]
*  The process is that when the lawyers found [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3721.2s)]
*  that these documents existed, they [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3723.7599999999998s)]
*  reached out to the archive and also the Department of Justice. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3725.2799999999997s)]
*  That is the process. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3729.48s)]
*  And they have been cooperating closely, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3730.44s)]
*  working closely with the Department of Justice. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3734.2s)]
*  And now, as you've heard, the Attorney General [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3737.16s)]
*  made a statement today. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3739.2799999999997s)]
*  And so I would refer you to them. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3740.9199999999996s)]
*  All right, everybody. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3743.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3744.08s)]
*  Oh, go ahead, Steve. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3745.2799999999997s)]
*  Twice in the last six months, the FBI [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3746.16s)]
*  has had to visit the home, private home, [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3747.7599999999998s)]
*  of a current and a former president [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3750.0s)]
*  to collect classified material. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3751.52s)]
*  Does the federal government have a records retention problem [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3753.08s)]
*  that needs to be addressed? [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3755.68s)]
*  Look, I'm not going to get into the politics of this [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3756.9199999999996s)]
*  or the specifics of this. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3759.8399999999997s)]
*  All I can say is the president has been very clear on this. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3761.16s)]
*  He takes this very seriously. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3764.6s)]
*  Again, he was surprised that the records were there, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3766.68s)]
*  that the documents were there. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3770.04s)]
*  He does not know what's in them. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3771.64s)]
*  His team did the right thing, which [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3773.04s)]
*  is, as the moment that they realized [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3775.88s)]
*  the documents were there, they reached out to the archive [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3777.92s)]
*  and they reached out to the DOJ. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3780.56s)]
*  I will see you all tomorrow. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3781.92s)]
*  Thank you, everybody. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lr9A6hIdJ4U&t=3783.3199999999997s)]
