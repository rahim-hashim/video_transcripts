# Harvard students walk back 'egregious' anti-Israel statement
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM)
*  File this under people who are allegedly so smart can be so dumb. Harvard students who [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=0.0s)]
*  signed a letter blaming Israel for the Hamas terror attacks, well, they're backtracking. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=5.36s)]
*  After more than a dozen CEOs said they're not going to hire any of them. One of the [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  students now saying, quote, as a board member of a Harvard group that signed the statement [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=15.96s)]
*  on Israel, I think it was egregious and have resigned from my role. I am sorry for the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=19.92s)]
*  pain this has caused. My organization did not have a formal process and I didn't even [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  see the statement until we had signed on. Here to react, staff writer at The Federalist, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=28.68s)]
*  Evita Duffy Alfonso. Evita, thanks for being here. I want to focus on the kids in a moment, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=33.28s)]
*  but let's start with the corporations. Quite a reversal from our typically woke corporations. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=37.44s)]
*  Your thoughts? It is. So I have a lot of thoughts on this and they're complicated because as [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=43.28s)]
*  a conservative student, right, this is exactly what corporate America does to us. There were [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=49.36s)]
*  was in school who were afraid to be in college Republicans pictures because they were afraid [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=55.2s)]
*  that a future employer would one day see it and then discriminate against them. So I'm [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=60.040000000000006s)]
*  hesitant to support doxing these students, but I will say that if these CEOs really wanted [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=63.800000000000004s)]
*  to help the students, they would be going after the universities who are the ones that [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=69.64s)]
*  are teaching them to behave in this way, to put out these Marxist inspired statements [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=73.64s)]
*  in support of the Palestinians. This is exactly what they've been taught to do in school. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=80.04s)]
*  So they want to do anything really. The CEOs would instead of sending blind checks to [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=83.88s)]
*  the universities, they would say, we're going to use the power of the purse to demand that [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=87.6s)]
*  these schools stop hiring exclusively Marxist professors and they stop establishing fake [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=93.11999999999999s)]
*  fields of study like CRT, which is where all of this is stemming from. Gave a great answer [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=98.39999999999999s)]
*  when it came to what is happening in the schools. I want you to take a step back and answer [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=103.91999999999999s)]
*  what is happening in these families because I think that's a broader issue. Why are college [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=108.56s)]
*  students in the United States of America merely 22 years removed from 9 11 siding with terrorists [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  in this conflict? Yeah, it's so I actually don't. I don't. I don't think that it is a familial [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=121.44s)]
*  issue. I really do think that it is the fault of the universities and the indoctrination [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=128.56s)]
*  machines, right? I'm upset at the student statements for two reasons. One of them is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=132.72s)]
*  that they claim to be in support of the Palestinians. But just like you said, nowhere do they condemn [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=136.52s)]
*  actions of Hamas, which have unleashed hell on many innocent Palestinians. This is a terrorist [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=141.64s)]
*  group that should be really easy for the students to condemn, and they have it. And the other [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=146.92s)]
*  problems that they're using this anti colonialist Marxist language to falsely equate the Palestinians [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  with BLM or with indigenous rights. This is all coming from the schools. These are they [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=157.04s)]
*  get Marxist inspired classes. We have Marxist inspired departments where they learn that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=162.44s)]
*  everyone on earth can be split into two groups, oppressed and oppressor. And because they [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=167.32s)]
*  view the Palestinians as as the oppressed, right, they excuse all kinds of violence in [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  the name of writing that inequity. This is textbook Marxist behavior. This is coming [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  from the universities. It's not coming from normal American families. And I think that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=183.0s)]
*  if the CEOs really wanted to do something about it, they would use the power of the [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=186.88s)]
*  purse to make real change within the university systems. Quick follow up on what you just [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=190.24s)]
*  You mentioned Marxism. Do you believe that this is all part of a concerted effort by [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=195.44s)]
*  people who want to bring down America to rip away and attack our Judeo Christian values [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=199.48000000000002s)]
*  that form to this nation? 20 seconds to you, Evita. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=205.20000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I think that's that's the whole purpose of Marxism in general, right? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=207.76s)]
*  This is a godless ideology. This is an ideology that that wants to rip Western civilization [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=213.96s)]
*  and Christian values away from this country. That is the purpose of it. And if we're going [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=219.48s)]
*  to stop it, right, because the university system spread their poison into all aspects [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=225.72s)]
*  of American life, we have to address universities and the indoctrination machines that they [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=230.12s)]
*  have become. I also love the fact that these children who've never had any consequences [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  for any of their actions when they're first presented with the consequence, they fold [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=238.2s)]
*  like a lawn chair. And that's what these Harvard students did. Evita Duffy Alfonso, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=242.04s)]
*  thank you for your insight. We appreciate it. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aTW4sTfwYCM&t=246.2s)]
