# Three US troops killed, dozens more injured in drone attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8)
*  All right, guys, thank you very much. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, today's attack, the first deadly one on U.S. forces in the Middle East since Israel's [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=1.96s)]
*  war against Hamas began on October 7th. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=7.12s)]
*  In that time, Iranian proxy groups have attacked our forces in the region at least 160 times. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=10.92s)]
*  Retired U.S. Navy Captain Chuck Nash joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=18.92s)]
*  And Captain Nash, if you could, first of all, I want to start here because it's my understanding [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=22.52s)]
*  that some of the injured troops from last night's attack were medevaced to Landstuhl [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=26.5s)]
*  in Germany. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=31.42s)]
*  Give us an idea of what is going on logistically to get our service members to less vulnerable [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=32.96s)]
*  positions in the Middle East. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=39.019999999999996s)]
*  Well, we've got over 2,000 service personnel stationed in Jordan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=40.9s)]
*  Most of them are at an air base down close to Amman. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=46.78s)]
*  This attack took place out on what we'll call the frontier. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  But the folks at the air base are there mostly for logistics. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=54.64s)]
*  So any of the wounded would be taken to that air base and then flown to Landstuhl, which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=59.18s)]
*  is a magnificent hospital. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=66.2s)]
*  And they specialize in critical casualty care. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=70.72s)]
*  So that's the first best place to go. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=74.67999999999999s)]
*  After that, once the patients are stable, they'll probably be flown to the National [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=77.58s)]
*  Military Medical Center at Walter Reed Bethesda. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=84.08s)]
*  OK, thank you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=86.39999999999999s)]
*  Well, I want to now take a look at a statement. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=89.08s)]
*  In his statement released this afternoon, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin expressed outrage [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=93.03999999999999s)]
*  and said he is deeply saddened by the deaths of three of our service members and the wounding [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  of other American troops. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=103.1s)]
*  Secretary Austin also said the troops were in northeastern Jordan to work for the lasting [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=105.48s)]
*  defeat of ISIS. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=112.52s)]
*  So I ask you, how will the attack impact that mission? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=113.84s)]
*  And is ISIS strong enough or organized enough to somehow take advantage of the Iran, Iranian [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=118.16s)]
*  proxy attack? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=123.96000000000001s)]
*  Well, a lot of what's going on up there on the frontier, which is on the border of Jordan [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  and Syria and Iraq, it's like a tri-border area there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=132.52s)]
*  Altanf is a base where we have some special forces and some other folks. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=136.8s)]
*  And what they're trying to do is interdict ground shipments on Highway 1 and the highway [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=141.42s)]
*  that comes out of Iraq that goes all the way actually across the country into Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=145.94s)]
*  So by setting up choke point there, they can interdict ground shipments of weapons to ISIS [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=152.1s)]
*  and to other players in Syria. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=160.34s)]
*  So the support base that got attacked is on the Jordanian side of that border, and it's [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=163.14s)]
*  called Rukban, R-U-K-B-A-N. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=169.82s)]
*  You can look it up on a map and see how close it is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=171.82s)]
*  But you could sit very easily on the other side of that border in Iraq, where these groups, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=174.46s)]
*  Katib Hezbollah, is known to have been operating. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=183.58s)]
*  K.T. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=186.82s)]
*  McFarland, who was just on your air, was exactly right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=187.82s)]
*  We know where these places are. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=189.8s)]
*  And that's what we need to do, is go out and smoke these things, not pinprick them. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=191.94s)]
*  I mean, smoke them. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=197.06s)]
*  Leave nothing but rubble and smoke behind, and it'll take out a bunch of people. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=198.3s)]
*  What's happened, unfortunately, Arthel, is they did this, so we did that, very proportional, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=203.9s)]
*  very nice. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=209.5s)]
*  They did this, we did that. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=210.5s)]
*  When they did this, we had just jumped to where we're going to go anyway, it would have [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=212.70000000000002s)]
*  been over, and nobody would have died except the bad guys. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=217.06s)]
*  But now what we're going to have to do is we're going to have to do something like this [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=220.9s)]
*  to try to claw back the deterrence that would have kept them at bay in the first place. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=224.86s)]
*  So yeah, things are going to get really interesting. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=230.5s)]
*  Well Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell released a statement as well this afternoon, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=236.78s)]
*  and in part saying, quote, the world, the entire world now watches for signs that the [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=241.22000000000003s)]
*  president is finally prepared to exercise American strength to compel Iran to change [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=247.38000000000002s)]
*  its behavior. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=253.02s)]
*  Our enemies are emboldened. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=254.38s)]
*  So in my last minute with you, Captain Nash, who's watching to follow the U.S. lead? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=257.02s)]
*  Who's watching, looking for weakness? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  The Iranians are looking for weakness. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=266.06s)]
*  Those who will follow are those who have the most to lose in this. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=268.4s)]
*  And the United States at this point has the most to lose, as do all of the other countries [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=273.9s)]
*  who would align with the United States but also have fifth columns within their countries. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=281.66s)]
*  Our southern border has been wide open. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=287.42s)]
*  We've had millions come across, many from countries that would support Iranian efforts. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=289.46000000000004s)]
*  That's what we've got to worry about here on the home front as well. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=295.82000000000005s)]
*  We'll leave it there. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=299.22s)]
*  Captain Chuck Nash, thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bI4gKJtWb8&t=301.94000000000005s)]
