# 'This is positive': VA Senator backs Trump lifting sanctions on Syria
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q)
*  Okay, joining us now, Virginia Democratic Senator Tim Kaine, member of the Senate Foreign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Relations Committee. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=4.0200000000000005s)]
*  Senator, welcome back. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=5.0200000000000005s)]
*  Great, Shannon, good to be with you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=6.0200000000000005s)]
*  Okay, so let's pick up with the president's trip. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=8.700000000000001s)]
*  Here's how one of your Democratic colleagues over on the House side, he's the ranking member [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=10.94s)]
*  on House Intel, Jim Himes, here's how he assessed the president's trip. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=13.86s)]
*  I'm not in the habit of praising Donald Trump. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=18.02s)]
*  I gotta tell ya, I think the president has in this last week or so played the Middle [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=20.580000000000002s)]
*  East pretty darn well. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=24.1s)]
*  How do you assess the trip? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=26.14s)]
*  Shannon, I'll go the good, the bad, and the incomplete. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=28.639999999999997s)]
*  So there is good. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=32.16s)]
*  I do think opening this new chapter with the Syrian leadership is a positive. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=34.04s)]
*  I would have suspended sanctions for 90 days rather than lifting them to make sure there [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=38.68s)]
*  was good behavior, but I think that's a positive. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=44.68s)]
*  Houthis are not firing at U.S. ships in the Red Sea. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=47.239999999999995s)]
*  That's a positive. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=50.599999999999994s)]
*  The discussions with Iran about restoring the nuclear deal that Donald Trump foolishly [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=51.72s)]
*  tore up in Term 1, that's a positive. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=56.5s)]
*  This hostage release is a positive. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=59.18s)]
*  On the bad side, you have glaring, glaring corruption issues raising again and again [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=61.379999999999995s)]
*  and again with the cutteries offer of a plane to Donald Trump, frankly in his private capacity. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=67.25999999999999s)]
*  Crypto deals, real estate deals benefiting Donald Trump's family, that is a horrible [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=73.78s)]
*  thing and I urge especially the cutteries, turn around before you stain your reputation [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=78.74s)]
*  with the United States in a way that you won't be able to recover from. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=84.24s)]
*  And then the incomplete is we've got to get back to the ceasefire and hostage release [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=87.44s)]
*  mode we were in when Donald Trump became president. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=94.2s)]
*  And I know they're working very hard on it and the release of this one American hostage [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=97.2s)]
*  was a positive, but I really worry that the IDF escalation of attacks in Gaza is going [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=101.36s)]
*  to push out ceasefire and hostage release farther and farther out into the future. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=107.56s)]
*  Nearly two-thirds of Israelis don't believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu is doing enough [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=112.38s)]
*  to prioritize hostage release and ceasefire. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=116.97999999999999s)]
*  The U.S. should be leaning in heavier to try to help get us to that day. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=120.82s)]
*  Yeah, and it sounds like we do have a voice in that mix. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=124.74s)]
*  Those talks for Doha for now are continuing there, so we'll watch to see if that bears [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=127.78s)]
*  any fruit. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=131.54s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=132.54s)]
*  To the point about the Qatari plane, the president continues to say, and by all accounts, it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=133.54s)]
*  would belong to the United States, not to him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=137.14s)]
*  That's my understanding of the deal, the Defense Department. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=139.94s)]
*  So we'll see where that goes, because there are Republicans and many of your colleagues [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=141.82s)]
*  who have publicly said they don't think it's a great idea either. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=145.16s)]
*  But let's go to Iran, because you mentioned that. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=147.95999999999998s)]
*  The president said on this trip, we're getting closer to a deal. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=150.28s)]
*  He says, I'm using trade to settle scores and make peace. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=153.28s)]
*  So it sounded like there was progress there. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  But this morning I'm looking at the feet of an Iran supreme leader and it has all kinds [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=158.74s)]
*  of things that don't sound like they're inching closer. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=162.16s)]
*  He says, you know, Trump says he wants to use power for peace. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=164.56s)]
*  He's lying. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=167.68s)]
*  We're going to continue to, you know, enhance our own power, increase our own power for [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=168.98000000000002s)]
*  our country's power every single day. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=173.86s)]
*  It's very critical. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=176.82s)]
*  Where do you think we are on these talks? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=178.3s)]
*  Shannon, I think the issue that's still the stumbling block, if you watch what happened [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=180.34s)]
*  last week, it's whether the stumbling block is whether Iran can have a civilian nuclear [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=186.94s)]
*  program but strict limits to stop them from having any military use. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=192.78s)]
*  So could they enrich for civilian purposes as long as that enrichment is limited to a [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=198.52s)]
*  level that couldn't be used for military? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=203.84s)]
*  And you've heard Vice President Vance and even President Trump suggested that some level [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=206.12s)]
*  of civilian enrichment might be acceptable. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=211.36s)]
*  You have Senate Republicans pushing back on that idea. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=215.2s)]
*  So I think that's probably the tough issue right now. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=218.4s)]
*  That's my intuition, not my intelligence. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=222.0s)]
*  But the fact that the dialogue is ongoing is good. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=225.9s)]
*  Dialogue guarantees nothing, but the absence of dialogue almost always guarantees something [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=230.5s)]
*  bad. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=234.94s)]
*  And so let's keep the dialogue going and see where we can get. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=235.94s)]
*  You'll hear tough talk from both sides until there is a deal. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=238.94s)]
*  If there is a deal, that's to be understood. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=242.58s)]
*  But the dialogue is ongoing and that's positive. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=244.38s)]
*  So dialogue going to be ramping up again tomorrow when it comes to Russia and Ukraine. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=246.66s)]
*  President Trump says he's got a call scheduled with President Putin. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=250.82s)]
*  We'll then speak with President Zelensky, who we know is meeting apparently now with [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=253.24s)]
*  Vice President Vance and also Secretary Rubio over in Italy. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=256.88s)]
*  So what do you need to see from these calls? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=261.64s)]
*  What do you think would be a measure of progress? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=264.32s)]
*  At what point does the U.S. disengage, should we, if there's not progress? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=266.64s)]
*  Well we shouldn't accept a bad deal. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=272.0s)]
*  We should disengage rather than accept a bad deal and foist it off on the Ukrainians and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=273.68s)]
*  all of Europe. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=279.18s)]
*  You know, look, I have spent a lot of time in the last two months with key European allies, [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=280.5s)]
*  Ukraine, Poland, Germany and Finland. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=285.18s)]
*  They all agree Putin is in bad faith. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=288.98s)]
*  They do not believe Putin will enter into a ceasefire on terms that are acceptable to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=291.84000000000003s)]
*  anyone. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=296.1s)]
*  But they are praising us for trying. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=297.1s)]
*  You know, if you don't try, you know it's not going to work out. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=299.8s)]
*  The key will be an agreement that the Ukrainians who are the victims, they were not the aggressors. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=303.66s)]
*  Vladimir Putin illegally invaded a sovereign nation for no legitimate reason. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=309.52s)]
*  He's committing war crimes every day. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=315.16s)]
*  I was in Ukraine the day after the Palm Sunday bombing in Sumi a couple weeks ago. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=316.76s)]
*  The key will be are there terms that the Ukrainians feel are acceptable and also that European [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=321.64s)]
*  nations feel are acceptable. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=327.0s)]
*  And Shannon, the reason that's important is European nations know that they will be needed [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=328.92s)]
*  to provide security in a post-ceasefire environment. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=334.0s)]
*  And so you can't cut a deal that they don't approve of or they're not part of and then [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=338.09999999999997s)]
*  tell them that they have to provide security guarantees. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=342.26s)]
*  They need to also look at this as a positive deal. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=345.3s)]
*  The Europeans are extremely skeptical about Vladimir Putin, but we got to keep trying [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=349.02s)]
*  and then let the Ukrainians and Europeans in the room essentially with us to decide [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=354.46s)]
*  whether a deal, if it comes to pass, is a good one or not. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=360.02s)]
*  Yeah, I look forward to read out from those calls tomorrow. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=362.74s)]
*  Meanwhile, I want to ask you about something domestically. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=364.74s)]
*  You were a big supporter of President Biden and his reelection campaign, and we've had [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=367.42s)]
*  a lot of revelations this week. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=370.6s)]
*  The tapes have now come out of Robert Herr interviewing the president about handling [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=372.56s)]
*  classified documents back in October of 2023. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=376.88s)]
*  We've got some of that later in the show. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=379.36s)]
*  But for people who haven't heard them or had a chance to listen, Axios describes them this [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=381.22s)]
*  way. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=385.44s)]
*  In a dry whisper voice and amid long uncomfortable pauses, Biden struggled to recall when his [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=386.44s)]
*  son died, when he left office as vice president, what year Donald Trump was elected. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=391.36s)]
*  This all comes on the heels of this new book that paints a picture of what to a lot of [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=396.32s)]
*  people sounds like a cover up. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=399.8s)]
*  What do you say today with this information out there about what Democrats did know before [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=402.5s)]
*  the president decided to run for reelection? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=407.98s)]
*  Was it a good idea? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=410.1s)]
*  What I knew, Shannon, is the Joe Biden I saw at the State of the Union in 2024 was very, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=413.84s)]
*  very strong. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=418.96s)]
*  Obviously, the Joe Biden at the debate in later June was not strong. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  And I told Virginians at that moment, look, if Joe Biden is not able to do this job, he's [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=425.4s)]
*  going to tell us and he's going to withdraw if he stays in the race. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=430.76s)]
*  It's because he knows he can do this job. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=433.91999999999996s)]
*  And he made the very difficult decision to withdraw. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=436.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, I think you and I know we've dealt with aging relatives. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=440.64s)]
*  It's hard to convince somebody to give up their car keys. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=444.47999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden made the decision to give up the office of the presidency, the most powerful [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=448.08s)]
*  office in the world. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=454.52s)]
*  And you can go back and try to rethink what should have happened in 2024. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=457.28s)]
*  But my Virginians are talking to me about, can you get rid of the Trump economic chaos? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=461.58s)]
*  Can you lift tariffs? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=466.74s)]
*  Can you protect Medicaid and Social Security? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=467.74s)]
*  They're not asking me to rethink what President Biden or his team did in 2024. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=469.9s)]
*  We'll talk more about that later in the show, how Democrats are answering that question. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  But Senator, we appreciate your time. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJUiUftxP_Q&t=477.38s)]
