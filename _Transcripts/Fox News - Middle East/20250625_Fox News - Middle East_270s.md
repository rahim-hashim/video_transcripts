# Here's what 'scares' Homan most
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY)
*  According to a House report last year, if there is an attack soon, the left will try [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=0.0s)]
*  and blame Trump, but the blood will be on the hands of Biden, Harris, Mayorkas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=5.84s)]
*  Here is reaction, Trump administration, Bortizaard, Tom Homan. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=11.28s)]
*  I have asked you this question a number of ways, a number of times. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=14.76s)]
*  It's like, to me, finding a needle in a haystack. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=19.48s)]
*  We know they're here. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=22.02s)]
*  We know Iranian assassination squads are here and other known terrorists are here, but we [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=23.6s)]
*  don't know where they are, do we? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=28.16s)]
*  No, we don't. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=30.16s)]
*  You know, Sean, you and I have been talking, I've been on your show a hundred times the last four years, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=32.16s)]
*  and we talked about the biggest national security vulnerability this country has ever seen with its open border. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=36.16s)]
*  And I agree with you 100%. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=41.16s)]
*  This is the biggest national security issue this country has ever faced. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=44.16s)]
*  Because not only did you get 700 and something released, number one, they can't be properly vetted. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=48.16s)]
*  Secretary Marcus said everybody released got vetted. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=54.16s)]
*  You think Iran would give us any information about their national security issues or what the past or records of these people are [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=56.16s)]
*  or their involvement in any national security? [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=66.16s)]
*  Iran is not going to give us that information. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=68.16s)]
*  And beyond that, you and I have talked many times about two million, more than two million gotaways that paid more to get away, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=70.16s)]
*  that crossed the border, we don't know who they are, where they came from, why they're here. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=77.16s)]
*  That scares me more than anything. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=81.16s)]
*  You know, so the intellectually lazy people, I can see it happening. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=83.16s)]
*  If God forbid there's an attack on our homeland and let's say the terrorist has a manifesto, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=88.16s)]
*  oh, because Donald Trump took out Iranian nuclear sites, they try to blame Trump. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=95.16s)]
*  No, I would blame the people that didn't secure the border, enforce the laws of our land, didn't vet the people coming in. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=101.16s)]
*  I don't care where you're from. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=109.16s)]
*  I believe in immigration. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=111.16s)]
*  I wouldn't be here but my grandparents, all four of them coming from Ireland, but they came in legally. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=112.16s)]
*  You know, if you're going to come into the country, you got to be vetted. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=118.16s)]
*  We got to make sure you don't have radical associations. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=121.16s)]
*  I believe in a health check and you can't be a financial burden on the American people, but do it legally. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=124.16s)]
*  And I don't then care where you come from. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=129.16s)]
*  Welcome to our family. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=131.16s)]
*  I've said that a million times. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=132.16s)]
*  So, you know, if it does happen, if you have a brain, they shouldn't have been here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=134.16s)]
*  That's the answer. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=140.16s)]
*  Well, here's what the American people need to know. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=141.16s)]
*  Donald Trump, the greatest president of my lifetime, because right after the election, we didn't wait until January 20th. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=144.16s)]
*  Right after the election, I worked with Steve Miller's and many others because we knew starting day one after inauguration, we got a big problem. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=149.16s)]
*  We got over two main gotaways. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=156.16s)]
*  We got thousands from China and Russia, Iran, Syria, Turkey. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=158.16s)]
*  We knew we had a problem. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=162.16s)]
*  We started working this even before the inauguration. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=163.16s)]
*  Day one, President Trump started to secure the border. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=165.16s)]
*  We secured border in seven weeks. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=168.16s)]
*  How many Syrians have been released? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=169.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=171.16s)]
*  How many people from Iran? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=172.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=174.16s)]
*  Iraq? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=175.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=176.16s)]
*  Turkey? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=177.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=178.16s)]
*  Russia? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=179.16s)]
*  Zero. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=180.16s)]
*  We have the Trump administration sealed the border. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=181.16s)]
*  We're not releasing. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=182.16s)]
*  We ended up catching these. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=183.16s)]
*  So we're spending every moment right now looking for these people that came to the country, the national security threats. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=184.16s)]
*  We got to get them quickly. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=188.16s)]
*  But then again, I'll say this. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=189.16s)]
*  We need the big, beautiful bill. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=191.16s)]
*  Right now, we need it more than ever. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=193.16s)]
*  We got over 20 million illegal aliens in this country. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=195.16s)]
*  We got over two million gotaways. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=198.16s)]
*  We got less than 5,000 deportation officers. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=199.16s)]
*  We need that bill passed. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=202.16s)]
*  We need that money. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=204.16s)]
*  We need the agents. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=205.16s)]
*  We need the beds. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=206.16s)]
*  We need the transportation. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=207.16s)]
*  We need the contracts. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=208.16s)]
*  We need the big, beautiful bill passed quickly so we can even put more effort into looking for these national security threats. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=209.16s)]
*  If the average American, if everyone watching the show tonight knew what you knew and Kristi Noem knew [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=217.16s)]
*  and Cash Patel and Dan Bongino and Pam Bondi knew, how scared would they be? [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=223.16s)]
*  I've been doing this for 40 years. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=231.16s)]
*  This is the biggest concern I've ever had. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=233.16s)]
*  You know, we had Fatinol that killed a quarter million Americans. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=235.16s)]
*  We had sex trafficking up 600%. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=238.16s)]
*  We got people on the terrorist wasps being arrested at the border. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=239.16s)]
*  I said from day one, two million plus gotaways. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=242.16s)]
*  This scares the hell out of me. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=246.16s)]
*  If you don't think a single one of them didn't come here to do us harm, then you're a moron. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=247.16s)]
*  This is the biggest issue I've seen in my 40-year career, and it scares the hell out of me. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=251.16s)]
*  It should scare the hell out of every American. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=255.16s)]
*  But thank God we got President Trump sitting in the White House because he's going to take this on 100%. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=257.15999999999997s)]
*  All right, Tom Homan, to you and all the people working with you and for you, Godspeed. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  Thanks for protecting the country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4W8lX9YBMEY&t=268.15999999999997s)]
