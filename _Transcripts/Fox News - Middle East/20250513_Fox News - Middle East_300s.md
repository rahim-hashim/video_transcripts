# Trump says only a 'stupid person' would say this about Qatar's gift
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc)
*  I said, where's the plane? And they're having difficulty. I'm not happy with Boeing, but [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=0.0s)]
*  we're going to work on Boeing. And Boeing's got some unbelievable people working for it. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=5.88s)]
*  So I'm not going to do anything bad to Boeing. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=11.92s)]
*  But they had a strong contract. I wrote the contract. It was a guaranteed price contract. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=13.96s)]
*  And if I wanted to, I could hurt Boeing, and I don't want to hurt Boeing. But they are [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=19.8s)]
*  very late with the plane. And Qatar heard about it, and he's a great leader. And we [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=23.36s)]
*  were talking, and he said, if I can help you, let me do that. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=31.68s)]
*  And they had a plane. Not a new plane at all, but they had a plane. And, you know, these [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=35.36s)]
*  planes, the plane that you're on right now is almost 40 years old. And when you land [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=40.16s)]
*  and you see Saudi Arabia and you see UAE and you see Qatar and you see all these — and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  they have these brand-new Boeing 747s mostly — and you see ours next to it, this is like [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=50.52s)]
*  a totally different plane. It's much smaller. It's much less impressive, as impressive as [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  it is. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  And, you know, we're the United States of America. I believe that we should have the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  most impressive plane. So anyway, so they said to me, we would like to — in effect, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=66.42s)]
*  we would like to make a gift. You've done so many things. And we'd like to make a gift [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=72.12s)]
*  to the Defense Department, which is where it's going. And they said, well, that's nice. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=78.16000000000001s)]
*  Now, some people say, oh, you shouldn't accept gifts for the country. My attitude is, why [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=83.68s)]
*  wouldn't I accept a gift? We're giving to everybody else. Why wouldn't I accept a gift? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=89.68s)]
*  Because it's going to be a couple of years, I think, before the Boeings are finished. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=94.2s)]
*  And they'll be wonderful when they're finished, but that's a long time. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=98.2s)]
*  What's part of your argument how the United States has paid untold billions and trillions [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=102.08s)]
*  of dollars securing every aspect of the world? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=108.2s)]
*  Well, I said that. I said, you know, we've secured that part of the world for many years. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=111.8s)]
*  So if somebody makes a gift — and I'm not getting — I get nothing. I get to fly it [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=116.52s)]
*  like any other president would. Ultimately, it'll be at the end of its lifetime or at [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=120.92s)]
*  the end of the term, because we're going to have the other ones in by that time. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=127.92s)]
*  So the U.S. has kind of given them gifts. It's called national defense and security. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=131.92s)]
*  Yeah. No, well, we give a lot of gifts. We give too many gifts, to be honest with you. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=136.32s)]
*  We give gifts to defend countries. They wouldn't even exist. Many countries wouldn't even exist. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=139.8s)]
*  All over the world, countries wouldn't even exist. But I thought it was a beautiful gesture. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=144.64s)]
*  Now, there are those that say, we shouldn't be accepting gifts to the Defense Department. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=149.52s)]
*  And I would say only a stupid person would say that. Why wouldn't we do that? And so [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=154.1s)]
*  it helps us out because we'll have a relatively new plane instead of having 40-year-old planes. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=157.98s)]
*  These planes are 40 years old, and that's not representative of our country. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=164.22s)]
*  Let me go to the other side, and that's the national security equation. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=167.98s)]
*  And I know every one of these countries that we will be stopping at here and we'll be [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=173.18s)]
*  reporting on on this show, every one of them is worried about one country, and that is Iran. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=178.46s)]
*  Number one state sponsor of terror. And obviously, the Iranians, you've been very, very clear. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=185.45999999999998s)]
*  They can't get a nuke. Right. They can't enrich. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=193.61999999999998s)]
*  According to published reports, they could be three to six months away from being a nuclear power. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=198.57999999999998s)]
*  There won't be a nuclear power. Let me just explain. I'm all for Iran. I want them to have a wonderful [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=206.1s)]
*  country and make a lot of money. They have great oil reserves. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=213.58s)]
*  But if you remember, when I was president, Iran was broke [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=217.58s)]
*  because they placed secondary sanctions, meaning you couldn't buy. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=221.82000000000002s)]
*  If you bought oil, you couldn't deal with the United States, and people [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=225.66s)]
*  make a lot of money dealing with the United States. So basically, they weren't selling [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=228.94s)]
*  any oil to almost anybody. It was down to a trickle, almost nothing. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=232.38s)]
*  And by the time it all came about, after a couple of years, they were essentially, they had no money. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=236.94s)]
*  And they didn't have money for Hamas. They didn't have money for Hezbollah. They didn't have any money [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=243.26000000000002s)]
*  at all. And we had no threat. And when Biden came in, he took off the sanctions and he let them get [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=247.98000000000002s)]
*  very rich. And now they have $350 billion or more, which is a tremendous amount. They made great wealth. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=254.06s)]
*  With oil, you make great money, great wealth quickly. And they have tremendous oil and tremendous [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=261.58s)]
*  reserves. And Biden freed them up from what I did. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=269.74s)]
*  And coming up, Louisiana Senator, our favorite Senator, John Kennedy will join us with reaction [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=274.7s)]
*  to this historic Middle East trip. And we are in Riyadh. We're in Saudi Arabia. Also, Clay [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=279.42s)]
*  Travis tonight. Straight ahead. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1QWl7OCORCc&t=284.7s)]
