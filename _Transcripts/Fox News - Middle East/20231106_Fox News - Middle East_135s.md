# US military announces a nuclear-powered submarine is in Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0)
*  Guess while the fighting continues inside the war zone, US Central Command says the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=0.0s)]
*  nuclear-powered submarine is now in the Middle East. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=3.72s)]
*  That is a clear message to our enemies in the region since the military almost never [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=6.68s)]
*  announces their locations. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=11.52s)]
*  Trey Leakes live on the ground in Israel with the very latest, Trey. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=13.200000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, hey Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=17.52s)]
*  We do know the fighting rages on inside the Gaza Strip behind me. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=19.92s)]
*  The Israelis say they've surrounded Gaza City and are expected to move in in the coming [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=23.64s)]
*  days. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=27.92s)]
*  I want to show you the neighborhood behind me in the northern part of Gaza. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=28.96s)]
*  The Israelis have been using their artillery units along the border and also their air [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=32.24s)]
*  force to strike different positions, trying to support the infantry troops that are inside. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=36.6s)]
*  We don't know exactly how many Israeli forces, but we are talking about thousands of soldiers [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=42.24s)]
*  who are supporting these efforts to go after Hamas leadership and also look for any of [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=46.44s)]
*  the hostages inside Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=50.88s)]
*  I do want to show you what it was like last night as the Israelis were using heavier [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=52.84s)]
*  bombs to target the tunnel system beneath the Strip. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=56.8s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=59.76s)]
*  You can see behind me the Israelis continue to use bunker buster bombs against the Hamas [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=61.559999999999995s)]
*  tunnel network underneath Gaza City. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=67.39999999999999s)]
*  The focus now is destroying as many of these tunnels as possible as the Israelis push deeper [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=70.44s)]
*  into Gaza. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=76.56s)]
*  The Israelis say over the past 24 hours they've hit 450 different Hamas targets, even getting [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=79.88s)]
*  into a command center last night and they say they killed a number of Hamas commanders. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=85.66000000000001s)]
*  This is an indication they will be more heavily engaged as they enter Gaza City. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  There's an understanding within the Israeli military that 80 percent of Hamas is inside [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=95.58000000000001s)]
*  Gaza City and this is where the real urban battle is expected to take place. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=100.30000000000001s)]
*  Over the weekend we were with the Israelis inside the Gaza Strip and got a firsthand [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=104.46000000000001s)]
*  look at that fighting. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=107.98s)]
*  We do know that as the destruction continues to rise across the northern part of Gaza, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=109.5s)]
*  the Israelis are once again telling people to go south. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=114.34s)]
*  That's where they say they'll be able to get more medical aid, food and supplies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=117.22s)]
*  We do know overnight the Jordanian government had approval from the Israelis to do a medical [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=121.22s)]
*  airdrop into Gaza, getting so much needed aid to the Palestinian people. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=125.7s)]
*  Todd, Carly? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=130.34s)]
*  Alright, Trey Yang, live on the ground for us in southern Israel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=131.34s)]
*  Trey, thank you so much. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eeKz_grdtb0&t=133.34s)]
