# Bongino blasts Dems critical of Soleimani strike: What team are you on?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo)
*  Tragically, his actions now put us on the path to another war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=0.0s)]
*  He's been erratic and unsuccessful in almost every previous foreign policy endeavor. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=8.0s)]
*  This one is the most dangerous of all. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=13.68s)]
*  We are not safer today than we were before Donald Trump acted. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=15.84s)]
*  Well, that's her opinion. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=19.6s)]
*  Some Democrats right there slamming President Trump for killing terror mastermind Soleimani. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=21.5s)]
*  Our next guest is fired up. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=26.76s)]
*  Fox News contributor Dan Bongino joins us now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=28.08s)]
*  Dan, when you hear Elizabeth Warren say we're not safer, but yet you hear that this guy [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=30.639999999999997s)]
*  was planning an attack on hundreds of Americans who are clearly safer today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=34.64s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=40.04s)]
*  You know, Ainsley, the Democrats and some in the media, the reaction to the killing [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=42.32s)]
*  of this savage, one of the most dangerous men in the world, has been an abomination. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=46.72s)]
*  I mean, it makes you seriously ask the question, I mean, what team are you on? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=51.32s)]
*  How is this not an unabashedly good thing for the security of the entire world? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=57.52s)]
*  You have to remember, it's not just American blood this savage was bathed in, it's regional [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=62.56s)]
*  blood as well. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=68.36s)]
*  Whether it was Libya, Afghanistan, Yemen, Syria, Bahrain, Iraq, this was a force for [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=69.68s)]
*  instability and insecurity around the entire world. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=76.32000000000001s)]
*  And just to be clear on this, so you don't think anybody here speaking with forked tongue, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=80.68s)]
*  I don't remember after Barack Obama ordered the killing, thankfully, of Osama bin Laden, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=85.08s)]
*  which was a successful operation for the United States and the world. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=90.12s)]
*  I don't remember any of this talk about, well, was bin Laden an imminent threat? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=93.08s)]
*  Well, did we really need to, did we dangerously escalate the situation? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=96.72s)]
*  You know who dangerously escalated the situation? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=100.72s)]
*  This Iranian savage we just killed when he decided it was a good idea to attack our embassy. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=103.72s)]
*  Where were the Democrats lecturing Soleimani and the Iranians then? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=108.4s)]
*  The answer is they weren't. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=111.74s)]
*  They were celebrating Obama, paying him off with $100 billion in cash that they still [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=112.74s)]
*  continue to claim was Iranian money. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=117.58s)]
*  Nobody, it wasn't Iranian money, it was the Shah's money. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=119.69999999999999s)]
*  Well, Dan, what do you make of the fact that within the last hour, Senators Schumer and [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=122.78s)]
*  Menendez of New Jersey have sent a letter to the White House saying, hey, you've got to [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=127.08s)]
*  declassify that war powers notification that you sent to Congress because we want the American [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=130.9s)]
*  people to see the justification for pulling the trigger on this guy. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=136.57999999999998s)]
*  And then you got Nancy Pelosi. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=140.06s)]
*  She says that the House is going to vote this week on an Iranian resolution that essentially [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=141.28s)]
*  restricts the president's ability to defend the United States and attack Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=145.8s)]
*  Yeah, that's interesting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=152.04s)]
*  I don't remember them doing that with Al-Alaqi or any of the Obama drone strikes. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=154.16s)]
*  You remember that guys? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=158.34s)]
*  Do you remember the Democrats pushing for that? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=159.34s)]
*  Of course you didn't because they're phony, fake, fraud hypocrites who I'm telling you, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=161.0s)]
*  you should be asking yourself today a very serious question. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=166.84s)]
*  I'm not kidding. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=169.56s)]
*  What team are these guys on? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=170.94s)]
*  We have seen them, Steve, defend MS-13. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=173.44s)]
*  Remember Nancy Pelosi? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=176.68s)]
*  Oh, you can't call MS-13 animals. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=177.68s)]
*  No, I think when your motto is rape, torture, kill, you can pretty much call people animals. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=179.12s)]
*  It's actually a disgrace to animals to call them animals. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=183.66s)]
*  But that's not where Pelosi was going with that. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=186.16s)]
*  Remember with the Kim Jong-un, the nuclear meetings we had? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=188.18s)]
*  It appeared that they were rooting for Kim Jong-un. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=191.32s)]
*  I mean, what team are these guys on? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=193.84s)]
*  Listen, do you really think this is going to get you elected that mainstream America [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=196.36s)]
*  wants to hear you defending one of the world's most dangerous people after we took him out? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=200.0s)]
*  Let's game plan this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=205.3s)]
*  Let's look ahead and we know what's going to happen. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  The Iranians have militias and relationships with terror groups all around the world, including [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=209.64000000000001s)]
*  sleeper cells in our country. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=215.32s)]
*  As soon as something happens, and sadly something's going to happen in reprisal, that's just the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=217.1s)]
*  way they work. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=221.24s)]
*  This is what they live for. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=222.24s)]
*  We've seen the Middle East. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=223.24s)]
*  I told you so. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=224.24s)]
*  We never should have done this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=225.24s)]
*  But you can't quantify the attacks that didn't happen because the supreme coordinator since [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=226.44s)]
*  1997 has been taken out and destabilized. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=231.8s)]
*  You can't quantify attacks that didn't happen because they no longer can figure out the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=235.28s)]
*  president who didn't do anything after the drone was shot down and the Saudi base was [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=239.16s)]
*  blown up, the oil plant was blown up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  Now all of a sudden they go, wait a second, what is this guy capable of? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=246.8s)]
*  So you can't quantify one, but you can quantify the other. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=250.64s)]
*  And then you're going to see almost Democrats almost high fiving after these attacks saying, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=253.98s)]
*  I told you so. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=257.47999999999996s)]
*  Well let me double down on your point there. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=259.56s)]
*  You're right, number one, you can't prove a counterfactual. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=260.91999999999996s)]
*  That's impossible. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=263.4s)]
*  You cannot show what would have happened if something happened that didn't happen. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=264.4s)]
*  Secondly, something already did happen, Brian. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=268.15999999999997s)]
*  We have 600 dead American servicemen buried underground whose families lost them, who [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=270.84s)]
*  died heroically because of this savage. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=277.12s)]
*  That already happened. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=279.92s)]
*  We already had an attack on our embassy that if it wasn't quelled by brave U.S. patriots [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=281.18s)]
*  and our military could have resulted in another Benghazi-like situation. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=285.68s)]
*  This already happened. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  As you just mentioned, we've already had regional violence in Yemen with their proxy groups [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=291.28000000000003s)]
*  starting instability all over the world that sadly can filter back here. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=296.0s)]
*  This already happened. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=299.96000000000004s)]
*  So that, you're absolutely right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=301.70000000000005s)]
*  If they start going down this road, blaming everything now from this point on President [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=303.36s)]
*  Trump, it would just be another disturbing, gross episode in the history of a now broken [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=306.96s)]
*  Democrat party on foreign policy. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=311.12s)]
*  What do you say to the people that do watch the networks when they're saying that this [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=313.03999999999996s)]
*  man was, they're praising him and... [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=316.71999999999997s)]
*  Revered. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=319.96s)]
*  Revered. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=320.96s)]
*  They say revered. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=321.96s)]
*  We've had guests on that say actually he was feared by many people over there who weren't [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=322.96s)]
*  his followers. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=325.47999999999996s)]
*  What do you say to the person that buys into that Democratic message? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=326.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, what are they going to call him next, an austere scholar? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=330.08s)]
*  No, they can't do that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=334.24s)]
*  They already did that with Baghdadi. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=335.46s)]
*  They've already used those adages. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=336.94s)]
*  This is really why upwards of 90% of Republicans and probably close, I don't know, 30, 40% [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=338.86s)]
*  of Democrats, 40, 50% of the population in general just can't stand the mainstream media [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=343.58s)]
*  and doesn't trust them for the news anymore. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=348.82s)]
*  They do it to themselves. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=350.32s)]
*  It's this kind of stuff. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=351.82s)]
*  I mean, it's really unbelievable that the world is now a safer place because of the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=352.82s)]
*  brave decisions of our military and President Trump and we just can't all take a victory [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=356.46s)]
*  lap and say, okay, what do we do together going forward? [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=360.5s)]
*  That whole idea politics ends at the water's edge is sadly dead and gone. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=363.4s)]
*  It's really disturbing. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  And I'll tell you, Joe Lieberman is a great piece about this in the Wall Street Journal [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=368.53999999999996s)]
*  this morning. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=370.91999999999996s)]
*  A Democrat, by the way, saying, guys, we all need to get on the same team here. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kp4itKzY3zo&t=371.91999999999996s)]
