# Retired Gen sends warning to Iran, proxies over US deterrence: 'We're dead serious'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE)
*  Joining us now, retired four-star general and Fox News senior strategic analyst, Jack [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=0.0s)]
*  Keane, general, great to have you back with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=4.32s)]
*  Great to be here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=5.8s)]
*  So I want to start with something overnight we got from the defense secretary, Austin, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=6.8s)]
*  talking about new assets moving into the region, the Eisenhower strike group. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=10.72s)]
*  He specifically references escalations by Iran and its proxy forces. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=14.4s)]
*  I mean, obviously, Hezbollah, Hamas among that, what are the greatest threats you see [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=19.12s)]
*  now? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=23.56s)]
*  Well, certainly the number one threat is Hezbollah. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  I mean, they're a paramilitary force. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=26.92s)]
*  They have conventional capability. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  They have 130,000 plus rockets and missiles that the Iranians have given them. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=30.8s)]
*  They got them from no place else. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=36.92s)]
*  And these are much more advanced, more precision, more lethality, and actually more accuracy [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=38.72s)]
*  in terms of the range of these weapons and what they can do on the ground. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=46.400000000000006s)]
*  So yes, they have a significant capability. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=51.68000000000001s)]
*  Cities have handled them before but struggled with it back in 2006. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=54.8s)]
*  What we would see here is a very heavy rocket and missile attack that can range all of the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=59.08s)]
*  major cities. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=64.84s)]
*  We've never seen it on a scale that they actually have. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=66.52s)]
*  Now, when you look at what's actually happening on the ground with Hezbollah, they have not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=69.6s)]
*  evacuated any of their southern positions, which they likely would have done with their [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=74.08s)]
*  people. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=79.56s)]
*  They've not gone to any kind of full mobilization yet, which they would likely do. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  But the only thing that is relevant here, and so our viewers understand, it's Iran. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=85.76s)]
*  They will make this decision whether they go or not. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=91.16s)]
*  And that's likely has something to do with how things go in Gaza with the Israelis and [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=95.5s)]
*  what the perception is in the international community as well. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  It's going to be Iran's decision just as the Hamas attack on Israel was Iran's decision. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=104.68s)]
*  I want to put up a map of the region there because there are so many other countries [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=110.68s)]
*  that we're talking with, we're trying to influence, trying to stop this from spreading more broadly [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=114.62s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=119.28s)]
*  How are we doing on that point? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=120.98s)]
*  Because as you said, Iran, many people believe, is calling the shots, but we have other actors [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=122.44s)]
*  there who can influence what's happening in the region. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=126.62s)]
*  Yeah, certainly. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=129.82s)]
*  What the United States is doing, first give the president credit for his speech the other [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=132.14s)]
*  night, something I think on the campus of Ukraine should have done a year ago, but it's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=135.94s)]
*  here now. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=140.28s)]
*  Secondly, certainly moving the military capability into the region that you're referencing is [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=141.28s)]
*  very critical. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=145.88s)]
*  Capability is part of deterrence. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=147.94s)]
*  The adversary sees the capability and they know it's powerful and they know it would [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=149.82s)]
*  harm them. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=154.26s)]
*  The second thing that's crucial with deterrence is are you willing to use it? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=155.3s)]
*  And that is where our adversaries have had doubts about the United States recently. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=160.82s)]
*  So I'm hoping that privately we are telling and poking a finger figuratively in the chest [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=166.42s)]
*  of the Iranians and saying, don't make this move because we are dead serious that we will [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=172.62s)]
*  use this capability against your proxies and possibly against you yourself. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=178.1s)]
*  I'll leave the target selection up to the administration and the Pentagon. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=182.94s)]
*  But that is what deterrence is all about. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=187.38s)]
*  It's not just enough to move the capabilities there. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=189.9s)]
*  Your adversary has got to believe you're going to use it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=193.02s)]
*  I want to ask you quickly too because you're just back from Ukraine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=195.22000000000003s)]
*  Polls show us that people growing weary here, at least about the financial support, not [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=198.22000000000003s)]
*  knowing what the finish line is. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  What can you tell us about what's happening there on the ground? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=203.38000000000002s)]
*  Well first of all, you've got to realize all this is connected, what's happening. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=206.06s)]
*  The United States is facing global security challenges we haven't seen since World War [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=209.10000000000002s)]
*  II, Shannon. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=213.5s)]
*  I mean, look at this. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=214.5s)]
*  We have three geographic areas, vital national interests. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=215.5s)]
*  Europe, China, the Indo-Pacific region, and also the Middle East. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=218.74s)]
*  War has broken out in two of those areas. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=223.34s)]
*  And in the third area, China, he's threatening it. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=225.10000000000002s)]
*  This is not happening by accident. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=228.06s)]
*  They perceive that we don't have the capability to deter them anymore, that we've lost some [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=230.26000000000002s)]
*  political will. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=234.3s)]
*  And he will be reflecting this loss of political will in Ukraine. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=235.8s)]
*  We not only have to support Ukraine, Ukraine's got to win this war. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  It's related to these other two regions. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  The world is becoming a more dangerous place. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=245.38000000000002s)]
*  And the United States' weakness is what they perceive, whether it's real or not, it's [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=248.22s)]
*  irrelevant. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=252.7s)]
*  They perceive it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=253.7s)]
*  We've got to win that war in Ukraine. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=255.06s)]
*  We cannot have Russia win that war. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=257.54s)]
*  That happens. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=259.46s)]
*  China wins, and so do the Iranians. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=260.46s)]
*  And what does it do? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=262.46s)]
*  It encourages them, it emboldens them. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=263.46s)]
*  We all see the aggression that has increased in the last couple years. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=265.86s)]
*  It's not by accident. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=269.66s)]
*  It's their perception that they have one opportunity, which is what the Germans, the Japanese, and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=271.26s)]
*  the Italians thought in World War II, and two, the perception of weakness. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=276.58s)]
*  And it's here. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=280.82s)]
*  It's very dangerous. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=281.82s)]
*  General, thank you for always giving us some of your insights and expertise. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLTxLL5DEXE&t=282.82s)]
