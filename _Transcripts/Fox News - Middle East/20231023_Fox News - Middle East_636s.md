# Biden admin reportedly urged Israel to delay ground invasion: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc)
*  We begin with the Fox News alert as we enter the third week in the war in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Israeli military bombarding Gaza with more strikes this morning and mounting limited [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=6.28s)]
*  ground raids into the Gaza Strip overnight. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=11.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, our U.S. State Department now telling all Americans to get out of Lebanon right [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=14.200000000000001s)]
*  now as Israel targets Hezbollah cells in that country. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  Our own Trey Yanks is live on the ground in southern Israel with the latest. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Trey, what's the latest on the ground? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=27.28s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys, good morning. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=30.8s)]
*  We understand from the Israeli military that 320 different targets were hit inside Gaza [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=32.12s)]
*  overnight. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=38.32s)]
*  They've also been launching a number of incursions into Gaza territory in an effort to try and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=39.32s)]
*  destroy any of the Hamas or Islamic Jihad positions that are along the border. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=44.28s)]
*  Just yesterday, near the town of Kisufim, an Israeli soldier was killed. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=48.72s)]
*  We were reporting in that area the day before and you could see into Gaza the Israelis [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=53.36s)]
*  looking to gather as much information as they can ahead of that expected ground operation. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=58.32s)]
*  You can hear the blasts of artillery headed into Gaza in the distance. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=63.6s)]
*  That gives you a sense of the border here and how a lot of that fire continues on the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=67.48s)]
*  ground. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=72.28s)]
*  I do want to show you some images from inside Gaza, the city of Khan Yunis that has many [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=73.28s)]
*  people that are sheltering after those evacuation orders to head south. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=78.76s)]
*  We're getting new images from inside Gaza as the Palestinian Health Ministry says more [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=82.68s)]
*  than 4,700 people have been killed since the October 7 massacre and the Israeli response. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  Take a listen to this man who describes the situation inside Gaza. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=92.76s)]
*  We were expelled from Gaza City. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=96.28s)]
*  They said Khan Yunis is a safe area. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  Now there is no safe space in all Gaza. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=103.36000000000001s)]
*  The strikes yesterday in Khan Yunis were different than any other night and thank God we are [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=106.64000000000001s)]
*  still here. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=112.60000000000001s)]
*  As we speak there are sirens sounding in the southern city of Be'er Sheva. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=116.04s)]
*  It's one of the largest population centers here in the south. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  Still 17 days into this conflict, factions inside Gaza have the ability to fire rockets [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=123.64s)]
*  toward these cities, not just in the south but also in central Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=129.20000000000002s)]
*  I do want you to listen to U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin who discussed the type of threat [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=133.56s)]
*  the Israelis are going to face when they do ultimately launch that ground operation into [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=138.72s)]
*  Gaza. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=143.16s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=144.16s)]
*  This may be a bit more difficult because of the underground network of tunnels that Hamas [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=145.44s)]
*  has constructed over time and the fact that they've had a long time to prepare for a fight. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=153.4s)]
*  So I think you'll see a fight that's characterized by a lot of IEDs, a lot of booby traps. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=160.28s)]
*  This is part of what the Israelis are doing with these cross border raids, trying to destroy [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=169.32s)]
*  of the cells that are along the border that would immediately ambush forces when they [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=173.24s)]
*  enter. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  I do want to draw our attention to the northern border where over the weekend more than a [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  dozen communities were evacuated from the border with Lebanon. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=180.8s)]
*  We do know Hezbollah, the Lebanese militant group, continues anti-tank guided missile [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=184.84s)]
*  attacks into northern Israel and also rocket fire. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=189.08s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was in the north yesterday meeting with soldiers [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  telling Hezbollah that if they get directly involved in this war they will be completely [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=196.92000000000002s)]
*  demolished. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=200.76000000000002s)]
*  The Israelis have continued airstrikes against different Hezbollah positions there in southern [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=201.76s)]
*  Lebanon. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=205.76s)]
*  Guys, back to you. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=206.76s)]
*  Hey Trey, I've got a question for you and that is we know that internationally there [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=207.76s)]
*  are a number of deniers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=212.48s)]
*  They say, yeah, that stuff never happened. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  Today it sounds like the Israeli forces are taking the unprecedented step of showing journalists [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=216.6s)]
*  there in Israel unedited video from the body cams of these essentially suicide bombers [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=222.28s)]
*  They went into all these places and chopped people to smithereens. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=229.56s)]
*  Is that to try to shut people up and prove that it did happen? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=233.52s)]
*  It's astounding and quite sad that there are so many people trying to deny that this massacre [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=240.56s)]
*  took place. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=245.84s)]
*  So the Israelis continue to release evidence. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=246.84s)]
*  Our cameras continue to capture evidence of what took place in southern Israel. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=249.76000000000002s)]
*  Israeli officials trying to show journalists from around the world that are here uncensored [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  video video that we can't show you on TV. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=258.92s)]
*  Some of it we can't even describe to you on TV because it is so graphic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=261.8s)]
*  But to give you a sense just of our reporting and where we are headed right now, we pulled [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=265.76s)]
*  over on the side of the road to bring you the reporting that we have. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=269.52000000000004s)]
*  We are headed right now with a group of Israeli military officials and they are currently [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=272.92s)]
*  cleaning out a bomb shelter where the Hamas militants threw in a grenade to kill civilians [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=278.6s)]
*  that were hiding when they entered on October 7th and conducted that massacre. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=286.5s)]
*  That's where we're going now to interview these military officials that are trying to [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=290.82s)]
*  clean up the scene. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=294.38s)]
*  It is truly hell on earth for the Israeli people and the fact that people are denying [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=296.02s)]
*  this took place is it just gives you the mindset of what Israel is up against not just on the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=300.46s)]
*  ground with the military operations and the war that is unfolding for the last 17 days [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=305.18s)]
*  but also the parallel information war. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=309.66s)]
*  Trey, the amazing thing is Hamas doesn't want to keep it a secret. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=311.74s)]
*  They're bragging about it. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=315.18s)]
*  They put a lot of the video up on their own sites. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=316.46s)]
*  They sent messages to people's Facebook addresses. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=318.97999999999996s)]
*  So this is not something they wanted to hide. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=323.82s)]
*  My question to you is this. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=326.18s)]
*  Did they detain any of the terrorists from the October 7th raid and are they talking? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=327.82s)]
*  It's a great question. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=337.94s)]
*  Over the weekend, Fox News exclusively obtained a video of an Israeli interrogation of one [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=338.94s)]
*  of these militants that entered. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=345.14000000000004s)]
*  In the video, he admits to these war crimes against the Israeli people. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=347.42s)]
*  He talks about the coordination that went into this massacre, how Hamas used Telegram [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=351.54s)]
*  to send updated videos in real time to show other militants and their commanders what [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=356.98s)]
*  was happening. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=362.1s)]
*  He also talked about how commanders told them to behead Israelis. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=363.1s)]
*  And then he goes into more detail after saying that they were acting like animals. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=366.78000000000003s)]
*  The interrogator asks him what they did. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=371.14000000000004s)]
*  And again, I can't tell you what we heard from this militant, from his own mouth, because [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=373.78000000000003s)]
*  the details are too graphic to describe on TV about what these men did to the bodies [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=378.5s)]
*  of Israelis after they slaughtered them. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  And it just, it is again remarkable that people are trying to deny this is taking place. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=387.46000000000004s)]
*  And it's part of the reason that as we bring you live coverage from the border here under [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=392.18s)]
*  rocket and mortar fire, I am insisting that we get into these communities. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=396.04s)]
*  We are pushing the Israeli military to take us with them to see the aftermath of these [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=400.46s)]
*  brutal massacres so that we can write the first draft of history, a truthful and accurate [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=405.62s)]
*  draft about what took place here on October 7. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=410.34s)]
*  Trey, any word on hostage, more hostage releases? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=413.18s)]
*  Because it's being reported that Joe Biden, when he spoke to Netanyahu, he was advising [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=416.58s)]
*  Israel to delay the ground invasion in Gaza, hoping to buy more time for the hostage negotiations. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=421.17999999999995s)]
*  Where are we on that? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=426.38s)]
*  Because I know there are 10 Americans that are still missing. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=427.38s)]
*  We've been talking with both American and Israeli intelligence sources to get a better [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=431.46s)]
*  understanding about where these negotiations take place. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=435.02s)]
*  We've also been talking with other officials we can't even attribute to because of how [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=438.09999999999997s)]
*  sensitive these conversations are. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=442.34s)]
*  But the Israelis say today the number of hostages being held inside Gaza has risen to 222 people. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=444.06s)]
*  Now there was this glimmer of hope last week when two American citizens were released as [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=451.5s)]
*  part of a deal that was negotiated by the Qataris. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=455.38s)]
*  Our sources tell us there are very high level conversations taking place behind the scenes [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=459.02s)]
*  to possibly get dozens of more hostages out ahead of this looming ground offensive. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=463.66s)]
*  But it's incredibly delicate what's taking place. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=468.26s)]
*  The Americans are urging the Israelis to be cautious about their ground operation if any [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=470.86s)]
*  more hostages can get released before that operation takes place. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=475.38s)]
*  But the clock is ticking and the attacks from inside Gaza continue, not just on the ground [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=479.22s)]
*  but also from the air. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=483.38s)]
*  It's putting the Israelis in a difficult situation about when to respond but also how they can [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=485.02s)]
*  get as many innocent civilians out as possible. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=489.58s)]
*  Trey, we're looking at this live footage of Gaza City as some of the strikes are happening. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=492.5s)]
*  I was talking with some friends that are in an IDF and they were describing to me some [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=498.26s)]
*  of these booklets that some of the Hamas terrorists had on them. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=503.3s)]
*  Can you go into a little bit of detail? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=507.65999999999997s)]
*  I don't know if you've seen some of those booklets that they were carrying with them [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=509.5s)]
*  with the translation into Hebrew. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=512.86s)]
*  What were these terrorists saying? [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=515.34s)]
*  Yeah, we were in southern Israel reporting from many different areas in the early days [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=520.34s)]
*  of this war. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=524.9s)]
*  And as we were driving toward the positions we went to report from, you could see the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=526.18s)]
*  bodies of dead militants on the sides of the road. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=529.94s)]
*  And with them, they had instructions on what to do and how to kill Israelis. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=533.82s)]
*  They were given phrases in Hebrew that were transliterated from Arabic so they could say [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=539.9599999999999s)]
*  them telling people to go door to door and tell their neighbors, it's okay, come out, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=545.64s)]
*  we're with you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=551.0s)]
*  This is the military. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=552.68s)]
*  They wanted to lie to these people and trick them into coming out of their homes so they [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=553.68s)]
*  could execute them. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=557.4s)]
*  This is how calculated the terror was and it is why this entire population is in a state [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=559.06s)]
*  of shock. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=564.5999999999999s)]
*  And I want to share with you an interview that we're going to bring you later on Fox [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=565.7199999999999s)]
*  News and friends actually next hour. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=569.2s)]
*  You remember the live images we brought you from the kibbutz, the small community of Neroz [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=571.24s)]
*  and the blood stained floors and this community that was slaughtered by these militants. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=576.84s)]
*  We went and tracked down a family member of someone whose father is currently being held [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=582.36s)]
*  by Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=586.64s)]
*  And we're going to bring you this interview next hour, but just to give you a preview [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=587.96s)]
*  of what this man says. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=591.16s)]
*  We went to his home and we spoke with him. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=592.6s)]
*  His brother was slaughtered by these militants and his father was taken hostage. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=594.6s)]
*  And I told him, can you just describe your father to me? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=599.3599999999999s)]
*  Who was this man? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=602.04s)]
*  Who is this man? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=603.04s)]
*  And he said, my father is a peace activist. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=604.04s)]
*  He spent his free time driving Gazan children to Israeli hospitals to get medical treatment. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=606.9399999999999s)]
*  He loved the Palestinian people. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=612.8599999999999s)]
*  He wanted to help them as much as possible. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=614.8399999999999s)]
*  He did art to protest violence against Palestinians. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=616.52s)]
*  And still they kidnapped him and they're holding him hostage inside Gaza. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=619.52s)]
*  And it gives you a sense of just how indiscriminate these militants were when they entered on [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  October 7th. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=627.04s)]
*  It's just awful. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=628.4s)]
*  That is. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=629.4s)]
*  And they killed his son. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=630.4s)]
*  All right. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=631.4s)]
*  Well, we look forward to seeing that interview next hour. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=632.4s)]
*  Thank you so much, Trey. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=634.1999999999999s)]
*  Thanks, Trey. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9z4nbaHgAHc&t=635.1999999999999s)]
