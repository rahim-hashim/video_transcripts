# ‘FORK IN THE ROAD’: Will Trump, Iran negotiations be a global ‘flash point’?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug)
*  Welcome back America. We're here with our friend Ben Domenech, the editor-at-large, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=0.0s)]
*  the spectator, Fox News contributor. You know, Ben, I think people underestimate Donald [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=6.08s)]
*  Trump in so many ways. He is very prudential. He's not ideological about matters domestic [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=11.72s)]
*  or foreign. He tries to figure out ways to make things work. And then at some point, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=17.98s)]
*  you know, he'll conclude one way or the other. How do you think this whole Iranian negotiation [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=24.28s)]
*  is going to do? Keep in mind, he has some advisors that I'm sure are pressing him very, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=30.68s)]
*  very hard, that under no circumstances take action with the Iranians. Well, he's got some [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=34.6s)]
*  advisors obviously advising him, you know, we don't think, Mr. President, that this kind [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=40.72s)]
*  of negotiation is going to work out. How do you think this is going to wind up? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=46.08s)]
*  Well, I think that the attitude, based on what I've been hearing both from people who are [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=49.52s)]
*  adjacent to the current officials and, quite frankly, from people who know what was going [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  on internally in the Biden administration in the closing months, that Donald Trump faces [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  a real fork in the road that's coming here about whether these negotiations are even [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=66.08s)]
*  possible, whether there's anything to be gained from them or whether this is a true flashpoint [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=70.76s)]
*  for the world, really. And obviously, there's a lot of different relationships you have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=76.48s)]
*  to factor into this. He's surrounded himself with a team of people who have different opinions, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  whether you're Marco Rubio or Mike Waltz or the people who are working underneath them, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  whether you're Tulsi Gabbard or JD Vance, you know, Pete Hegseth, obviously, in the [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=90.36s)]
*  mix as well. He's getting a lot of different ideas from a lot of different people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=94.12s)]
*  But I also think that his relationship with Benjamin Netanyahu can't be underestimated [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=98.80000000000001s)]
*  as being a major factor in this. He knows and trusts Bibi to a much greater degree than he does [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=103.12s)]
*  other world leaders. Certainly, they have a much better relationship than Netanyahu had [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=109.96s)]
*  with the entire Biden team. And I think that that has to factor into this to a greater [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=116.6s)]
*  degree than it would perhaps under a different president. He is prudential, as you said, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=121.84s)]
*  and he's very much of a mind that he wants to be known as a peacemaker. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=126.44s)]
*  But if he truly believes that there is no progress to be made in negotiation with Iran, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=130.44s)]
*  I don't think he's going to hesitate when he gets to that point to pull the trigger. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=135.64s)]
*  Why do you think so many, maybe not so many, but at least the cabal of self-appointed [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=139.6s)]
*  influencers and others are so cocksure that if Iran gets a nuclear weapon, if Iran does, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=145.68s)]
*  it's manageable? Where the hell does that come from? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=152.44s)]
*  Well, it only flies in the face of everything that we've thought about in foreign policy. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=155.92s)]
*  Last several decades, I think that cocksure is the is the right word to use for this. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=160.92s)]
*  I wouldn't underestimate, though, Mark, the also the fact that there is a very dedicated campaign, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=167.88s)]
*  a well-funded campaign, in fact, I believe, to undermine the American relationship with Israel [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=174.35999999999999s)]
*  that has been going on for years, some of it in plain sight, some of it behind the scenes, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=179.8s)]
*  well-funded and very active, trying to influence American policy in every way that they can. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=185.56s)]
*  And part of that has been, I believe, a lobbying effort that has unfortunately swallowed up some [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=192.36s)]
*  of the people who are traditionally thought of as being on the right to some arguments that I think [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=198.04s)]
*  they should be wiser to they would be wiser to ignore and should understand where they're [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=204.04s)]
*  actually coming from. Our relationship with Israel is in our interest. It is not just a situation [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=208.84s)]
*  where we feel the way that we do because of our friendship or because of the influence of evangelical [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=214.92s)]
*  Christians or anything along those lines. It is in our national security interest to keep that [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=220.84s)]
*  relationship as strong as ever. And I believe that they are prepared to do what it takes if they're [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=224.92s)]
*  given the permission and the backing and perhaps not even need the resources of the United States. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=230.35999999999999s)]
*  That depends on what they want to do. You make such a great point. I mean, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=235.95999999999998s)]
*  we've watched over the last two years or so. Israel has all but defeated Hamas, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=239.4s)]
*  all but defeated Hezbollah. Nobody even thought that was possible. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=245.64000000000001s)]
*  The enemy of the United States, Hezbollah murdered marines. Hezbollah blew up two of our embassies. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=250.12s)]
*  They were funded by Iran. Iran has sought to assassinate our president. I mean, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=255.96s)]
*  what's the trigger line here at some point? Why do they keep saying Israel's trying to drag us [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=261.64s)]
*  into a war when Iran's made it quite obvious that they want to take us out or at least our leaders [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=265.56s)]
*  out? Look, I think that the question really is the trigger point, as you said. But again, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=270.76s)]
*  your example, I think, applies here as well, which is that Israel is perfectly capable of [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=276.92s)]
*  doing these things themselves. They've had plans in place for forever. They know how to approach [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=281.24s)]
*  this, and they've just proven that they can do things that a lot of people in America didn't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=287.0s)]
*  think they were going to be able to do once they had the backing and the permission to do it. And [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=291.4s)]
*  then, you know, sometimes without that too, because they knew what needed to be done. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Xe4C3_5ug&t=296.67999999999995s)]
