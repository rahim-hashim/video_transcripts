# Graham to Palestinian supporters: US would've told critics to buzz off after 9/11
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o)
*  South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, you know, I watched Chuck Schumer today, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=2.0s)]
*  and it was good to finally hear him speak out. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=4.3s)]
*  He spoke out powerfully against anti-Semitism. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=7.84s)]
*  I'm sure a lot of it directed at his own party. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=11.540000000000001s)]
*  Where was he when Congresswoman Talib was saying, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=14.280000000000001s)]
*  you know, to wipe Israel off the map, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=17.94s)]
*  from the river to the sea? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=19.68s)]
*  And why did Chuck Schumer? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=21.14s)]
*  There was a standalone aid bill for Israel [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=22.68s)]
*  on the Senate floor yesterday, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=25.92s)]
*  and he, I'm told, was leading the effort [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=27.72s)]
*  to stop that aid bill. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=30.52s)]
*  Is that correct, sir? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=31.759999999999998s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=33.36s)]
*  So Senator Schumer made an eloquent presentation [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=34.48s)]
*  about the rise of anti-Semitism, and he's right about that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=38.1s)]
*  So what happened here is 3911s for Israel [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=41.76s)]
*  occurred on October the 7th. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=45.32s)]
*  1,200 Jews were slaughtered in their homes, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=47.32s)]
*  the biggest killing of the Jewish people since the Holocaust, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=49.96s)]
*  and you have an Oakland, California people praising Hamas. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=52.96s)]
*  The Democratic Party supports the Palestinians [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=56.4s)]
*  over the Israelis for the first time in polling last year. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=59.32s)]
*  So this effort by my Democratic colleagues [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=63.34s)]
*  to put restrictions on money going to Israel [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=65.76s)]
*  to defend themselves is sick and absurd. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=68.5s)]
*  This call for a ceasefire is nuts. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=71.34s)]
*  What would we have said to a group [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=74.92s)]
*  that asked us to have a ceasefire after 9-11? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=77.32s)]
*  We told them to go to hell. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=80.44s)]
*  So here's what I say to my Democratic colleagues. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  Support Israel without conditions. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=84.86s)]
*  Allow them to destroy Hamas [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=87.78s)]
*  before it's too late for the Jewish state. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=90.34s)]
*  Stand with Israel, reject Hamas, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=92.88s)]
*  tell all these crazy people to shut up. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=96.02s)]
*  The bottom line here is the Republican Party is with Israel. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=99.28s)]
*  The Democratic Party is very confused. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=103.44s)]
*  Well, I mean, I really don't understand [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=106.7s)]
*  why Washington works this way. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=109.3s)]
*  I understand. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=111.18s)]
*  Well, okay, fair answer. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=112.94s)]
*  But I know what Chuck wants to do here. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=115.5s)]
*  He wants to tie funding for Israel [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=117.74s)]
*  to funding for Ukraine, for funding with Taiwan, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=119.66s)]
*  and maybe he'll give some money to the border. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=122.58s)]
*  The House is not gonna go along with that, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=125.34s)]
*  period, end of sentence. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=127.1s)]
*  I don't see that happening. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=128.18s)]
*  Israel has not gotten any aid money. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=130.22s)]
*  Ukraine has gotten nearly $80 billion of money. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=132.74s)]
*  We're paying more than Europe is paying. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=136.22s)]
*  It's their continent that is at war, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=137.9s)]
*  and I think that's been unfair on their part. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=141.26s)]
*  My question is, why can't we vote on every bill [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=143.74s)]
*  as a standalone on the merits, up or down, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=147.14s)]
*  and why are these games always played? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=150.3s)]
*  If he's so concerned about Israel, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=152.26s)]
*  he had an opportunity to help them yesterday, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=154.22s)]
*  and he passed on that opportunity. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=156.62s)]
*  Yeah, so we need to bring up an Israel standalone bill [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=158.9s)]
*  and support Israel and be done with it. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=162.5s)]
*  But I'm not gonna give money to foreign countries [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=165.14s)]
*  until we secure our own border. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=167.74s)]
*  10 Democratic senators wrote a letter [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  opposing efforts to provide border security, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  opposing policy changes that would secure our border. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=176.22s)]
*  Governor Abbott, if you're watching Sean Hannity tonight, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=179.7s)]
*  do me a favor. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=183.06s)]
*  Make it real to those 10 senators in their states [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=184.82s)]
*  what you've been dealing with in Texas. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  Instead of sending them all to New York, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=190.98s)]
*  why don't you look at the states in question? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=193.34s)]
*  Rhode Island, Connecticut, Oregon. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=196.62s)]
*  Governor Abbott, make it real to these 10 senators [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=199.02s)]
*  what it's like to live with a broken border. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=202.3s)]
*  Send thousands of illegal immigrants [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  to make it real to the politicians [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=207.9s)]
*  who oppose border security. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=210.06s)]
*  The Democratic position is remain in Texas. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=212.66000000000003s)]
*  They're okay with Texas being overrun. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=215.5s)]
*  Governor Abbott, send busloads of illegal immigrants [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  to these senators so they will understand what it's like [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=221.18s)]
*  to live with a broken border. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=224.38s)]
*  Let me ask you, Senator, we hear this virulent anti-Semitism [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=226.26s)]
*  in the halls of Congress. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=231.06s)]
*  We see it on college universities, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=232.06s)]
*  prestigious universities, a lot of them. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=235.18s)]
*  We see it in the streets of our cities. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=238.57999999999998s)]
*  We are seeing it worldwide all across Europe. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=240.66s)]
*  We're seeing it even in Australia. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=243.42s)]
*  Gas the Jews, F the Jews. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=245.82s)]
*  Did you ever think in our lifetime [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=248.57999999999998s)]
*  we'd ever hear those words in light of the history [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=250.78s)]
*  of what happened in Nazi Germany? [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=253.9s)]
*  Because that sounds like the 1930s to me. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=255.73999999999998s)]
*  And I've never used that analogy very often. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=257.97999999999996s)]
*  I thought it was often misused and overused. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=260.38s)]
*  I don't think so in this case [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=263.02s)]
*  based on the knowledge we have of the acts they committed [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=264.65999999999997s)]
*  that are on videotape, frankly, that I would like to air, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=268.14s)]
*  except I'm sure it would be too harmful for the families [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=272.06s)]
*  unless we pixel out their faces. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=274.65999999999997s)]
*  Well, I'm gonna call people at Fox tomorrow [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=276.21999999999997s)]
*  and beg them to put on the air some of the videos [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=278.9s)]
*  so you can see for yourself [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=282.98s)]
*  what happened to the Jewish people. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=284.66s)]
*  You can see that on October the 7th, 2023, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=286.62s)]
*  80 years after the Warsaw uprising in Poland, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=290.22s)]
*  Hamas wants to kill all the Jews for religious reasons. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=293.86s)]
*  The Nazis wanted to kill all the Jews [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=297.66s)]
*  because of racial reasons. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=299.62s)]
*  I never thought I would live to see a Holocaust survivor [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=301.22s)]
*  who survived the Nazi terror [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=304.46000000000004s)]
*  to be killed by Hamas in Israel. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  We live in dangerous and sick times. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=308.82s)]
*  I am begging Fox to air the footage [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=311.5s)]
*  so the American people can see what Israel is facing. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=313.86s)]
*  No conditions on Israel aid. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=317.62s)]
*  To my friends in Israel, do what you need to do [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=319.54s)]
*  as long as it takes to defend your country. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=322.1s)]
*  To the Palestinian people, turn on Hamas. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=324.74s)]
*  Kick them out. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=328.26000000000005s)]
*  Lindsay, you know Israel well. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=330.62s)]
*  You've been over there many times. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=332.5s)]
*  I've been there many times. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=333.94000000000005s)]
*  I've been in the terror tunnels. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=335.1s)]
*  I know you've been in the terror tunnels. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=336.46000000000004s)]
*  I've been near the Iron Dome. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=338.66s)]
*  I've been to border towns like, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=341.9s)]
*  they wrote 10,000 missile rockets [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=343.66s)]
*  they got hit with in a 10-year period of time. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=346.82s)]
*  Kids can't play outside. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=349.18s)]
*  They play in underground bunker playgrounds. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=350.58s)]
*  And I'm thinking, victory to me is this. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=353.38s)]
*  Once and for all, Gaza can no longer be a launching pad [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=358.26s)]
*  for rockets into Israel. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=362.18s)]
*  But that also includes in the north. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=363.66s)]
*  Lebanon could no longer be a launching pad either [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=365.78s)]
*  if they want to have real security and peace [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=368.42s)]
*  in the region and security for Israel. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=371.42s)]
*  But I'll say this, nobody seems to ever wanna talk [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=373.22s)]
*  about the number one state sponsor of terror, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=375.94s)]
*  and that is Iran. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=378.38s)]
*  That we now know they trained Hamas for this. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=379.58s)]
*  They supplied them with weaponry for this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=381.98s)]
*  They are fighting another proxy war, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=384.14s)]
*  one of many in the region. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=385.90000000000003s)]
*  They have been fomenting terror [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=387.38s)]
*  and getting away with it for a long period of time. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=388.90000000000003s)]
*  I would say it might be time for the world to realize [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=391.58s)]
*  in the entire region that maybe those refineries [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=394.18s)]
*  that Joe has allowed them to use [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=397.3s)]
*  more than Donald Trump did, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=399.9s)]
*  maybe those refineries need to go. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=401.5s)]
*  Maybe those nuclear facilities, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=403.9s)]
*  maybe they need to go before they get nuclear weapons. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=405.82s)]
*  Well, so we've been on your show a lot talking about this. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=409.17999999999995s)]
*  How do you protect American troops in Syria and Iraq? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=411.7s)]
*  You attack Iran when we're attacked in Syria and Iraq [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=414.78s)]
*  by Iranian proxies. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=417.65999999999997s)]
*  This Biden administration is incredibly weak. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=419.14s)]
*  Nobody respects them, nobody's afraid of them. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=422.06s)]
*  Let me tell my friends in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=424.73999999999995s)]
*  if you go into BRICS and join an organization [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=428.7s)]
*  made up of Iran, Russia and China, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=432.14s)]
*  you're gonna make an enemy of me. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=434.58s)]
*  Let me tell my friends in Saudi Arabia, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=436.46s)]
*  I want you to normalize with Israel. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=438.26s)]
*  I'd like to have a strategic relationship with you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=440.06s)]
*  But if you join BRICS, an organization basically controlled [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=442.74s)]
*  by Russia, China and Iran, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=446.82s)]
*  you will be an enemy of the United States. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=449.98s)]
*  Biden has lost all respect and all fear to the Iranians. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=452.14s)]
*  If you kill one American in Syria and Iraq, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=457.3s)]
*  and I know you're trying to do your proxies, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=460.21999999999997s)]
*  I will do everything I can to make sure you're hit in return. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=462.65999999999997s)]
*  To the Republican Party, let's stand up for Israel [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=467.38s)]
*  without equivocation. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=470.38s)]
*  Let's put pressure on the Biden administration [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=471.74s)]
*  to protect our troops. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=473.74s)]
*  President Biden does not have the backs of those serving [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=475.38s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=478.41999999999996s)]
*  Mr. President, President Biden, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=479.74s)]
*  you need to let the Iranians know [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=481.34s)]
*  if you keep trying to kill Americans, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RcEPg1tP3o&t=482.78s)]
