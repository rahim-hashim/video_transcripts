# Biden admin's 'lack of vision' in Middle East is a concern: Retired general
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8)
*  Now to our top story, the U.S. launching a new round of retaliatory strikes against Iranian-backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=0.0s)]
*  Houthi rebels in Yemen overnight. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=5.96s)]
*  Navy destroyer USS Carney attacking a Houthi-controlled radar site using Tomahawk land attack missiles. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=9.16s)]
*  Their latest strike comes just a day after the U.S. partnered with the U.K. to carry [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=16.6s)]
*  out dozens of strikes on the Houthi-controlled areas across Yemen. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=20.28s)]
*  The Houthis, however, continue to terrorize shipping vessels in the Red Sea, launching [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=24.6s)]
*  a ballistic missile towards international shipping lanes. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=28.22s)]
*  In total, the Houthis have now attacked 29 ships in the region over the last two months. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=30.86s)]
*  Let's bring in General Anthony Tata. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=36.42s)]
*  He's U.S. Army Brigadier General. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=38.7s)]
*  Helped give us perspective on this this morning. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=40.66s)]
*  General, thanks for being with us. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=43.54s)]
*  What do you make of the latest when it comes to both the strikes from the Houthis and now [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=45.78s)]
*  America strikes against the Houthis? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=49.66s)]
*  Yeah, good morning, team. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=52.019999999999996s)]
*  Our Navy will always do us proud. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=55.06s)]
*  What I'm really concerned about is our administration's lack of vision in the region. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=57.76s)]
*  And this, you know, under Trump administration, we had maximum pressure. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=63.28s)]
*  There seems to be maximum appeasement with regard to Iran. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=67.28s)]
*  And these are, make no mistake about it, Iranian proxies that are fighting against the U.S., [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=72.56s)]
*  against commercial shipping, against the Western world within the Horn of Africa area. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=79.32s)]
*  So, you know, when we look at it, do we know who's in charge? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=85.36s)]
*  This chaos and confusion that has been projected, not just over the last few weeks, but really [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=89.84s)]
*  beginning with the Afghanistan withdrawal and beyond. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=96.16s)]
*  It projects weakness and the enemy whenever they see weakness, probes and attacks. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=101.44s)]
*  And that's exactly what's happening here. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=106.64s)]
*  So I'm not concerned about our our sailors. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=108.48s)]
*  They're going to do an awesome job. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=111.24s)]
*  What they're told to do. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=113.03999999999999s)]
*  What I'm concerned about is this appeasement of Iran that gives the green light to attack [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=114.72000000000001s)]
*  our people, our friends, our allies. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=120.64s)]
*  And we've removed the hoodies a couple of weeks after Biden takes office, Blinken does, [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=123.76s)]
*  from the terrorist watch list. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=129.6s)]
*  And all really is a stick in the eye to MBS and Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=131.56s)]
*  But still, it was a it was a stupid move and we need to put them back on there. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=136.4s)]
*  We need to get after all of the targets that we can and we need to deter Iran, which we're [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=140.58s)]
*  not doing. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=146.54000000000002s)]
*  General, I know that President Biden was asked about whether the hoodies were terrorists. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=147.54000000000002s)]
*  He said, yes, they are. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=153.26000000000002s)]
*  So now he's backtracking on that idea as well. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=154.46s)]
*  But what's the message not just to Iran, but to China in all of this? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=157.02s)]
*  Yeah, Rachel, what's going on is we just look weak and confused. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=163.3s)]
*  You know, over Christmas and the holidays. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=168.46s)]
*  And I pray for Lloyd Austin. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=171.06s)]
*  I know him. I hope he recovers fully from his cancer. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=172.3s)]
*  The but but the confusion that we have projected when he had a deputy that couldn't be bothered [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=176.26000000000002s)]
*  to come off vacation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=181.5s)]
*  His chief of staff couldn't send an email to notify people. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=182.94s)]
*  The arrogance that that is projected really projects weakness around the world that this [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=187.02s)]
*  this administration doesn't have a plan. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=195.78s)]
*  They don't have a vision. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=197.62s)]
*  And, you know, China is licking their chops at Taiwan right now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=198.62s)]
*  That's gone through a presidential election. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=202.38s)]
*  So it's it's a really grave time in the world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=204.9s)]
*  And we've got major conflicts going on in our intelligence apparatus doesn't seem to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=208.18s)]
*  be kidding it right. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=214.18s)]
*  So it's really scary time right now. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=215.5s)]
*  Yeah, nothing says strength, General, like your secretary of defense calling in airstrikes [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=217.62s)]
*  from the hospital after he was AWOL there for days and no one knew about it. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=221.46s)]
*  Joe Biden was asked yesterday about whether he has confidence in Austin following that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=226.02s)]
*  Here's here's what he had to say. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=230.3s)]
*  Do you have confidence in Secretary Austin? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=231.3s)]
*  I do. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=234.3s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=235.3s)]
*  I don't. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=236.3s)]
*  Was it allowed to do it? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=237.3s)]
*  I heard him not to tell you earlier. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=238.3s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=241.3s)]
*  So, I mean, one word answers there. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=242.3s)]
*  But it feels like whether it's Afghanistan, look at the recruiting crisis, you look at [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=246.1s)]
*  what I mean, there have been failure after failure after failure, yet no one ever is held [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=250.22s)]
*  accountable, General. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=254.66s)]
*  Never. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=255.66s)]
*  Yeah, Pete, it breaks the narrative if they hold someone accountable. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=256.65999999999997s)]
*  If you if you fire somebody after Afghanistan like McKenzie or whomever, it would break [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=260.26s)]
*  the narrative that it was awesome, that it was the world's largest airlift. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=265.78s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=269.06s)]
*  When in fact, it was a colossal failure. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=270.06s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=273.42s)]
*  The intelligence myths there, the intelligence myths in Ukraine. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=274.42s)]
*  Remember, they offered Zalensky a ride out on the eve of the invasion because their intelligence [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=277.94s)]
*  said Russia was going to own it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=283.66s)]
*  And now, you know, we've got this, we've got the Hamas miss. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=285.78000000000003s)]
*  I'm worried about our border. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=289.9s)]
*  Is that the fourth intelligence failure that that our people are so focused on other things [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=291.58s)]
*  right now and not what's first and foremost in the minds of most Americans, which is our [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=298.1s)]
*  safety and security. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=304.42s)]
*  They're ceding authority to the globalist agenda. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=306.1s)]
*  What the UN wants as opposed to what what we need here in this United States. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=309.86s)]
*  That's a great, great point. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=316.66s)]
*  By the way, the Houthis have vowed revenge. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=318.02000000000004s)]
*  So, you know, we have an open border. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=320.06s)]
*  That's a scary proposition as well. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=322.18s)]
*  General Tata, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=325.26s)]
*  Thank you, General. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=327.66s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qlYT3G_JuJ8&t=328.66s)]
