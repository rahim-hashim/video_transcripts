# Secretary Blinken arrives in Israel with U.S. hostage envoy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE)
*  Rabbi Iyer Lightstone served as the senior adviser to Donald Trump's adviser to Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=0.0s)]
*  David Friedman, and he joins us now from Tel Aviv. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=5.86s)]
*  Rabbi, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=8.44s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=10.0s)]
*  One of the big news items of the day has to do with Secretary of State Antony Blinken. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=11.78s)]
*  He is in Israel right now, but he's going to meet with Palestinian Authority President [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=15.0s)]
*  Mahmoud Abbas on Friday, probably to try and use diplomacy to get hostages back. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=19.14s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=25.6s)]
*  Well, I'm optimistic he won't spend a lot of time doing that because Abbas has zero [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=27.959999999999997s)]
*  control over what Hamas does and in Gaza. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=32.04s)]
*  What he does have the ability to do is to make sure that the West Bank does not get [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=36.28s)]
*  set aflame like Gaza has been set aflame. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=39.92s)]
*  Israel is in a precarious situation because Gaza, the North, as you've so articulated [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  with Hezbollah, but you also have the West Bank, Judea and Samaria, which is under Abbas's [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=48.76s)]
*  control, at least the Palestinian component of it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=53.959999999999994s)]
*  And if Blinken has juice, he will demand that it stays quiet and peaceful, or else [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=56.92s)]
*  we will sever our relationship with them. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=62.900000000000006s)]
*  This is not the time for yet another front to open up. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=64.88s)]
*  Rabbi, Hamas officials vowing that Israel's united front would not, quote, intimidate [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=68.32000000000001s)]
*  or deter the resistance. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=73.92s)]
*  Quote, we have been preparing for this attack for years. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=75.6s)]
*  This, according to a senior Hamas official, the resistance fighters have prepared to engage [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=78.68s)]
*  in the most vicious of battles for many months. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=83.0s)]
*  And when I hear that, Rabbi, I harken back to that phrase that outside forces may have [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=86.72s)]
*  the watch, but the people in the Middle East have the time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=92.46s)]
*  Obviously, Israelis are part of the Middle East. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=97.24s)]
*  But when you hear a statement like that, how concerned does that make you and how concerned [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=99.92s)]
*  should that make the IDF? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=105.68s)]
*  I think two things. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=108.48s)]
*  Number one is for, quote, senior leadership from Hamas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=109.48s)]
*  If you want to look up cowards in the dictionary, it's their pictures. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=113.92s)]
*  They're sending their people out to fight and to die. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=116.92s)]
*  There's no senior leadership in the tunnels. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=119.6s)]
*  There's no senior leadership in these houses. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  The senior leadership is in Doha driving Lamborghinis and living in villas. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=123.4s)]
*  This is easy for them to call whatever shots they want to call. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=127.56s)]
*  All of the weapons that are there could have been used to build hotels, to build businesses, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=130.96s)]
*  to build sewers, to build hospitals, to build power plants. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=135.44s)]
*  They didn't do it for any of those things because they're willing to sacrifice their [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=138.44s)]
*  people, but not themselves. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=141.56s)]
*  So the Israeli troops have been to the front lines. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=143.84s)]
*  I've met many of the troops there just in the last several days. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=145.92000000000002s)]
*  Their will is strong. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=149.28s)]
*  Their ability is strong. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=150.36s)]
*  And if you look at the images that have been so painful to watch on WhatsApp, TV, whatever [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=152.24s)]
*  else it would be, if they didn't know their purpose for fighting, they sure as heck know [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  their purpose now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=163.52s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Benny Gantz, his [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  political rival, agreed to form an emergency unity government, which sounds like it would [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=169.64s)]
*  be something like Donald Trump and Joe Biden coming together to form a government. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=174.92s)]
*  How significant is that? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=180.6s)]
*  Are you surprised that this is taking place? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=181.76s)]
*  And what does it mean about the unity that Israel is facing right now, despite the fact [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=183.48s)]
*  that they were very politically divided just one week ago? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=187.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, not surprised at all. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=191.07999999999998s)]
*  Incredibly grateful that it's happening. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=194.16s)]
*  Every mother and father who has their kids on the front line needs to know that this [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=196.4s)]
*  is not being driven by a political motivation. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=199.68s)]
*  It's being driven by the country, the flag above all, and being able to put two rivals [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=202.52s)]
*  together to be able to face this. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=207.12s)]
*  I don't want to call it an existential threat, but it's going to be a challenging threat [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=209.28s)]
*  for the people of Israel. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=213.56s)]
*  Knowing that this is apolitical is enormously important to the people on the front lines [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=214.96s)]
*  and to their parents who are standing behind them. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=220.12s)]
*  President of the United States spoke yesterday, the Biden administration. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=223.16s)]
*  Nevertheless, won't say won't say the words. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=226.12s)]
*  Iran is behind the attack. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=230.6s)]
*  President Biden told the Iranians that this little warning to quote unquote, be careful. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=232.24s)]
*  Rabbi, six days into the conflict, why can't Joe Biden? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=237.52s)]
*  Why can't the Biden administration just blame Iran already? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=242.04s)]
*  Well, it would be like having cancer but not going to a cancer doc. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=246.88s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=251.88s)]
*  You want to address the symptoms. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=252.88s)]
*  You don't want to address the symptoms. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=254.16s)]
*  You need to kill the disease. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=255.32s)]
*  And without naming the disease, you can't treat it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=257.0s)]
*  And the reason is, is because this administration has been complicit in helping Iran grow stronger [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=259.8s)]
*  and more powerful. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=265.32s)]
*  And the vacuum of U.S. leadership has allowed the bad guys to be able to have this ability [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=267.28s)]
*  to be able to enfranchise Khamas and Hezbollah and others. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=273.92s)]
*  This administration needs to take responsibility and to put them back in the box that they [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=278.08s)]
*  were just three years ago. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=282.12s)]
*  You mentioned needing to talk about Iran in order to focus on Hamas. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=284.04s)]
*  I would say, doesn't Biden's refusal to officially blame Iran delay whatever reprisals we ultimately [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=289.68s)]
*  need to do against Iran and give them more time to coalesce whatever world support there [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=296.32000000000005s)]
*  may be for the Iranian view of this? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=302.32000000000005s)]
*  If you can't name it, you can't get support. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=306.8s)]
*  You're 100% correct, Todd. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=308.72s)]
*  One of the first things that the president should do is take the $6 billion that he was [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=311.4s)]
*  going to give the Iranians for the hostages that were released, it feels like a year ago, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=314.12s)]
*  but it was only, I think, 10 days ago at this point in time, and immediately resupply Israel [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  with that money. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=323.96s)]
*  Take the victims of terror in Israel and give them an opportunity to start over with those [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=325.32s)]
*  $6 billion. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=329.03999999999996s)]
*  Take it off the table and demonstrate to the Iranians that they're teeth to your words. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=330.03999999999996s)]
*  Rabbi, Aryeh Lightstone, thank you so much for joining us, sharing your perspective. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=335.0s)]
*  Once again, we always appreciate it. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=338.64s)]
*  Thanks, Rabbi. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U60xksvEYRE&t=340.12s)]
