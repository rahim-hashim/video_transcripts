# What a China, Iran partnership means for the US
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 29, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI)
*  Meanwhile, word from Tehran that Iran's looking to China for military support while stalling [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=0.0s)]
*  talks with the U.S. about a renewed nuclear deal. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=6.9s)]
*  Where does this leave everything going forward? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=9.78s)]
*  Michael Singh is the former senior director to President Bush's National Security Council. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=11.58s)]
*  Nice to see you in person. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=16.06s)]
*  Yeah, great to see you. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=17.06s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=18.06s)]
*  I got the Road and Belt program primarily in Africa. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=19.06s)]
*  This seems to be along a similar line. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=21.34s)]
*  How do you see this going now with Beijing moving in? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=23.26s)]
*  Well, look, we've seen China really increase its military involvement, its diplomatic and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=25.580000000000002s)]
*  military involvement in the Middle East, and not just with Iran, you know, with U.S. allies [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=29.98s)]
*  as well. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=33.64s)]
*  The Chinese defense minister who's in Iran right now was in Saudi Arabia in January. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=34.64s)]
*  We saw this sort of secret military construction in the United Arab Emirates, which has been [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=39.24s)]
*  a sort of bilateral irritant between the U.S. and UAE. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=43.96s)]
*  But I think there's no doubt, Bill, that the Chinese see Iran as their most important strategic [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=47.36s)]
*  partner in the region. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=52.56s)]
*  Look, China needs energy. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=53.56s)]
*  It needs oil imports. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=54.92s)]
*  China worries about U.S. control of the Strait of Hormuz and U.S. sort of military presence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=56.6s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=61.28s)]
*  Iran is the only country there on the Strait of Hormuz in the Persian Gulf which isn't [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=62.74s)]
*  an ally of the United States, which where China can sort of build its relations unfettered [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=65.7s)]
*  by that U.S. factor. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=70.88s)]
*  And there's no doubt that Iran looks at China not necessarily as a friend, but as a country [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  that shares a desire to take the U.S. down a peg. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=77.3s)]
*  A business partner. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=79.98s)]
*  For sure. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=81.02000000000001s)]
*  There's a new poll that shows Americans see China as a superpower and as a threat. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=82.02000000000001s)]
*  If you see here, 67% think that and that their influence is getting stronger at 66%. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=86.42s)]
*  I think that does reflect reality. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=92.88s)]
*  And yet it's interesting because we see China, they're trying to do a lot of things, but [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=94.44s)]
*  in the meantime there's a huge story about them locking down major cities. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=98.0s)]
*  Their people can't get out. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=101.88s)]
*  They don't have a lot of information. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=102.88s)]
*  But the stories are kind of getting out there. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=104.32000000000001s)]
*  China is a problem, but are they also weak? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=107.62s)]
*  Well, look, I mean those numbers you cited, Dana, one thing that's so remarkable about [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  them is how fast they've changed. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=114.16s)]
*  If you look at Americans' opinions of China, the negative views of China have rapidly increased [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=116.1s)]
*  over the last four or five years. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=122.14s)]
*  That shows you just how rapidly this U.S.-China sort of confrontation is moving. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=124.74s)]
*  But there is no doubt that China does have these big internal challenges. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=129.18s)]
*  COVID has been certainly one of them. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=132.5s)]
*  It has other economic challenges. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=134.54s)]
*  It's facing more resistance from neighbors like India, Japan, and South Korea. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=136.3s)]
*  And the question is, well, is that going to help the United States or does that all make [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=141.98s)]
*  China even more dangerous? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=145.5s)]
*  As those domestic problems mount, will it look to sort of stoke foreign crises as a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=147.5s)]
*  way to take attention away from those things? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=152.46s)]
*  I think that's a real worry inside the government. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=154.42s)]
*  It is possible within a few days or even a week's time. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=156.22s)]
*  We'll see what decision they make on Beijing. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=158.62s)]
*  But you've got a 50 million people in that country in a lockdown. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=160.06s)]
*  Right. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=162.78s)]
*  You've got Shanghai right now at 23 million. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=163.78s)]
*  You double that with Beijing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=164.78s)]
*  Let's see what they do. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=165.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, later in this year, world leaders are going to still talk to each other. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=167.34s)]
*  And in Jakarta, Indonesia, there's a G20 summit planned in the fall. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  And Indonesia today sent a clear indication of Vladimir Putin that he is welcome to come [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=176.44s)]
*  there. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=180.84s)]
*  John Kirby said this on CNN last hour about that invitation. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=181.84s)]
*  No, he absolutely shouldn't be. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=185.32s)]
*  I mean, he has isolated Russia by his own actions and he should continue to be isolated [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=187.28s)]
*  by the international community. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=191.92000000000002s)]
*  It's inappropriate, I think, for the entire international community to keep treating Russia [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  as if things are normal because it's not. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=197.4s)]
*  Michael, as you move the chess pieces globally and geographically, and now even politically, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=199.9s)]
*  how does this work out in your mind? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=206.18s)]
*  Well, look, I think the reality is that a lot of countries who are partners of the United [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=207.9s)]
*  States are also partners of Russia and they don't want to take sides. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=211.9s)]
*  Even though, you know, we look at this and say it's so obvious which side is right, a [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=216.62s)]
*  lot of these countries sort of are falling back into this sort of non-aligned mindset. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=220.3s)]
*  And they don't want to take sides between the West and Russia. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=223.94s)]
*  They want to preserve good ties with the likes of Russia and China. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=227.34s)]
*  And I think for the United States, what we're going to need to do is sort of acknowledge [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=230.9s)]
*  that and be tailored in our requests of partners like Indonesia, the UAE and so forth, and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=234.7s)]
*  focus on what are the practical steps that we can quietly work with them on to make life [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=240.45999999999998s)]
*  more difficult for Vladimir Putin and focus less maybe on some of these sort of, you know, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=246.06s)]
*  more showy things like votes in the UN or attendance at G20 summits. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=251.26s)]
*  I think that's the reality. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=255.1s)]
*  Do you think President Biden, if Putin is going to go to that conference in Jakarta, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=256.12s)]
*  do you think that President Biden should not go? [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=260.0s)]
*  I think it'll be very difficult for President Biden to go and say stand in a photo with [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=261.84000000000003s)]
*  President Putin. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=265.68s)]
*  Absolutely not. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=266.68s)]
*  And not just President Biden. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=267.68s)]
*  I think you're going to see Western leaders overall be reluctant to participate in those [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=268.68s)]
*  kind of meetings. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=272.08000000000004s)]
*  So the G20 could be over. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=273.08000000000004s)]
*  It could be over or it could be over for the time being. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=276.28000000000003s)]
*  Regardless, it could be a dramatic moment. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=277.28000000000003s)]
*  For sure. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=279.48s)]
*  Michael, nice to see you. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=280.48s)]
*  Good to see you both. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=281.48s)]
*  Take care. Have a good weekend. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=282.48s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YcUYCpkLdI&t=283.48s)]
