# Rand Paul: We need to make sure we get this right
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs)
*  Let's now bring in Senator Rand Paul to respond to Bill Barr, who we just heard wants to strike [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=0.0s)]
*  the Iranian nuclear facilities. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=6.12s)]
*  Rand Paul's also the author of the new book, Deception, The Great COVID Cover-Up, which [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=9.06s)]
*  we'll get to at some point. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=13.48s)]
*  So you heard what he wants to do, missile attacks against the Iranian nuclear program, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=15.52s)]
*  decimate it before they can go nuclear. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=20.84s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=23.2s)]
*  You know, I have nothing but sympathy for the Israeli people at this point in time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=24.2s)]
*  I think that the primary objective at this time has to be to get the people that attack [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=28.44s)]
*  them. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=33.2s)]
*  They were in Gaza. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=34.2s)]
*  Before we think about spreading this to the rest of the world, maybe we ought to think [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=35.32s)]
*  about exactly what's going on on the ground there. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=37.88s)]
*  I do think that there is immediate reaction sometimes to let's get everybody, let's get [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=40.72s)]
*  everybody who's responsible. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  And without question, Iran had their hands in this. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=48.28s)]
*  But you remember after 9-11, there were people who wanted to attack Iraq. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=50.88s)]
*  They said Iraq caused 9-11. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=53.760000000000005s)]
*  Turned out Iraq didn't have anything to do with 9-11. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=55.36s)]
*  Let's see where the facts lie. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=57.8s)]
*  Let's investigate this and let Israel need to do what they need to do, which is to have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=59.28s)]
*  a punishing response to the people in Gaza to say no more. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=64.76s)]
*  We're not going to let this happen again. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=68.28s)]
*  When you follow the money, if the money goes from the Biden administration and it goes [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=69.84s)]
*  to Tehran and then Tehran sends it to Hamas and they use it to slaughter Israelis and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=73.92s)]
*  Americans, what are we doing here? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=79.52s)]
*  The question has to be is, everybody has the anger. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  Look, I've got the anger. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=86.8s)]
*  I have no sympathy for these thugs pulling young women and children, shooting people, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=87.88s)]
*  point black, and they had nobody of sympathy for them. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=92.64s)]
*  In fact, I think they lose sympathy for their cause by doing such horrendous, outlandish [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=94.28s)]
*  things. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=98.96s)]
*  But at the same time, if someone says, well, we need to stop Iran from having a nuclear [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=99.72s)]
*  weapon, we're going to bomb them. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=103.72s)]
*  We have to realize that there have been assassinations of nuclear scientists in Iran going on for [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=105.16s)]
*  about the last six to eight years. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=110.6s)]
*  Every time we assassinate one of them, the enrichment goes higher. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=112.84s)]
*  We had maximum pressure sanctions. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=116.28s)]
*  The enrichment went higher. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=118.39999999999999s)]
*  People say they're within a week or two of enrichment. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=119.52s)]
*  Now, people say we're going to bomb them. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=121.88s)]
*  We're going to bomb them to smithereens. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=123.16s)]
*  Well, when you get uranium to like 100 percent or 95 percent enrichment, you can have as [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=124.83999999999999s)]
*  much as in that little box there and you can hide it anywhere. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=130.72s)]
*  You can have it in 20 different places. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=133.2s)]
*  You can have it at the base of a mountain. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=134.56s)]
*  You can't really put them back and you can't really bomb knowledge away. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=136.32s)]
*  And I'm not saying you look the other way. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  Something will have to be done. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=141.35999999999999s)]
*  But we have to be careful of the bomb now, bomb them everywhere, bomb them all the time. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=142.8s)]
*  And our founding fathers were conscious of that. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=146.8s)]
*  They said we need to vote on these things. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=148.48s)]
*  No one person, no president, no one person gets to decide when war happens. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=151.24s)]
*  And while war is a means of retribution, it isn't always pretty and it always doesn't [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=155.2s)]
*  always get exactly what we intended as well. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=159.56s)]
*  That is a key point. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=161.8s)]
*  The Biden administration cannot go off half cocked, doing whatever it is that they're [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=163.0s)]
*  planning on doing or not doing without consulting with the U.S. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=167.84s)]
*  Congress. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=171.2s)]
*  Well, look what happened in Afghanistan. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=171.64s)]
*  They decided to exit from a commercial airport. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=173.44s)]
*  What kind of moron leaves your troops in a commercial airport when they do? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=176.04s)]
*  Thirteen of our soldiers die. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=179.88s)]
*  You saw what Joe Biden was doing at their funeral, checking his watch after each [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=181.64s)]
*  casket went out. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=185.12s)]
*  So what did he do in response? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=186.32s)]
*  Everybody says you got to do something, do something. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=187.6s)]
*  So he bombed an aid worker, a completely innocent worker in his family was bombed [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=189.4s)]
*  out of anger, out of sheer anger. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=194.2s)]
*  So angry, you know, I'm angry, I'm angry. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=196.04s)]
*  I can't see those images without being angry and sympathetic to the Israeli people. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=199.12s)]
*  But if you act out of anger, irrationally, sometimes you do the wrong thing and make [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=202.56s)]
*  things worse. So all I ask is you want war, you want to drop a bomb on Tehran. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=206.68s)]
*  You don't do that like you're chewing bubble gum. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=211.24s)]
*  This is a really, really serious thing that we need to make sure we get right before [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=214.36s)]
*  we launch into a worldwide war. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=218.60000000000002s)]
*  OK, we already know we can't walk and chew gum at the same time. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  So let's just take it one step at a time. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=223.56s)]
*  Senator, thank you so much. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=225.8s)]
*  Thank you. Everybody go check out the book. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=227.08s)]
*  Right now. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UaeE5n1DZs&t=229.08s)]
