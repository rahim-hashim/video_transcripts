# White House grilled on possible military strikes within Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 30, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw)
*  We're awaiting an update from the Pentagon later today as our Secretary of State says [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=0.0s)]
*  the U.S. response to the drone attack that killed three U.S. troops in Jordan could be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=5.88s)]
*  multi-level and come in stages. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=10.88s)]
*  You're watching Fox and Friends First here on a Tuesday morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=12.96s)]
*  I'm Todd Pyre. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=15.16s)]
*  And I'm Carly Shimkus. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=16.16s)]
*  This comes as we learn the identities of the three Army soldiers killed in the attack. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=17.16s)]
*  Two of them were under 25 years old. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=21.28s)]
*  Now some are calling on the U.S. to send a direct message to Iran immediately. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=24.16s)]
*  Mark Singman is live with the details. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=29.68s)]
*  Good morning, Mark. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=31.12s)]
*  Yeah, guys, the Pentagon releasing the names of the three soldiers killed in that Iran-backed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=32.12s)]
*  attack. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=36.4s)]
*  We now know that they were all assigned to the 718th Engineer Company, an Army Reserve [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=37.4s)]
*  unit based in Georgia. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=42.04s)]
*  Their names are Sergeant William Jerome Rivers of Carrollton, Georgia, Specialist Kennedy [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=43.84s)]
*  Ladon Sanders of Raycross, Georgia, and Specialist Brianna Alexandria Moffett of Savannah, Georgia. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=48.28s)]
*  The State Department is set to hold a briefing this morning as the president faces growing [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  calls to take action against Iran. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=58.4s)]
*  It sounded like the administration has ruled out strikes within Iran. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=60.6s)]
*  Jackie, I appreciate the question. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=65.6s)]
*  I think you can understand. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=67.64s)]
*  I hope you can understand. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=69.12s)]
*  I'm not going to telegraph punches here. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=70.12s)]
*  We are not looking for a war with Iran. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=71.68s)]
*  We are not looking to escalate the tensions any more than they already have been escalating. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=73.84s)]
*  In fact, everything we've done has been designed to try to de-escalate those tensions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=77.44s)]
*  Is it that the administration ultimately does not hold Iran responsible for these attacks, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=81.64s)]
*  or that the current level of risk and loss to U.S. troops is somehow acceptable? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=86.44000000000001s)]
*  I am not going to telegraph punches for the president of the United States. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of his decision space and how he's going to respond. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=93.4s)]
*  We'll respond appropriately. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=96.84s)]
*  A U.S. official has confirmed to Fox News that the Iran-backed drone that killed those [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=98.32000000000001s)]
*  three troops and injured more than 40 others was actually mistaken for a U.S. drone that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=103.12s)]
*  was set to return to base at the same time. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=108.48s)]
*  The White House is refusing to comment. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=111.24000000000001s)]
*  But so far, there have been at least 165 attacks on U.S. forces since October 17th. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=113.6s)]
*  Florida Congressman Mike Walz says we must respond strongly. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=119.88s)]
*  Listen. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=123.52s)]
*  I'll remind everyone, the reason we have small numbers of special operators, drone operators [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=124.52s)]
*  and others in the Middle East is they're still going after ISIS and keeping a boot on their [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=130.66s)]
*  neck so they don't hit us here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=135.84s)]
*  Right now, they're sitting ducks for Iran and their militias. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=138.96s)]
*  Sean, it is a simple reversal of policy. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=143.4s)]
*  You hit the IRGC operatives that are running around the Middle East, including Soleimani's [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=148.08s)]
*  successor. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=153.24s)]
*  Number two, you dry up the cash. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=154.88s)]
*  Iran's received over $100 billion in oil sales, waivers and hostage money since Biden has [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  come in. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=165.52s)]
*  This marks the deadliest attack against U.S. forces in the Middle East since the Abbey [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=167.24s)]
*  Gate bombing during the final days of the Afghanistan withdrawal. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  Guys. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=174.16s)]
*  All right, Brooke Simon, live for us. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=175.16s)]
*  Brooke, thank you. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=176.16s)]
*  Brett Velikovitch is a former special operations intel analyst and drone expert, and he joins [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=177.16s)]
*  me now. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=181.84s)]
*  Brett, the fact that this enemy drone approached the base at the same time a U.S. drone was [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=182.84s)]
*  scheduled to return, what do you make of that? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=188.4s)]
*  Well, that's a technology issue because it sounds like they mistook it for a U.S. drone, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=192.28s)]
*  so they need to get a, you know, handle on that as soon as possible. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=197.44s)]
*  But the reality is America has the capability to deter Iran and groups like Qataba, so that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=200.8s)]
*  it doesn't happen like this again. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=207.16s)]
*  And we should. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=208.68s)]
*  We should start with it with strength, not just in our words, but in our actions. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=209.68s)]
*  And frankly, the top of this administration doesn't seem to understand these terrorist [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=213.52s)]
*  groups very well. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=216.96s)]
*  The government right now actually has real experience successfully combating these Iranian-backed [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=217.96s)]
*  groups before, because I don't recognize anyone at the top of this administration who understands [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=224.08s)]
*  how to deal with them or went up against them in Iraq or Afghanistan. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=227.84s)]
*  And I've said it time and time again, Iran is at war with us, and they've been aggressively [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=231.68s)]
*  activating their proxy groups globally to target Americans. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  And we don't seem to be at war with them or have any real cohesive campaign strategy to [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=239.52s)]
*  stop them, other than to just say, hey, please don't do it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=244.0s)]
*  And that's not working. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=247.28s)]
*  They keep getting away with it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=248.44s)]
*  And these recent drone strikes are the consequences of that weak foreign policy. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=249.96s)]
*  And it's going to get worse. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=253.68s)]
*  I mean, how many more U.S. soldiers need to die before this administration wakes up? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=254.44s)]
*  Well, it's a good question. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  And according to Politico, the Biden administration had only responded to 10 percent of the 160 [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=260.16s)]
*  attacks on U.S. soldiers in Iraq and Syria. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=267.0s)]
*  And now the president is facing a big choice. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=270.68s)]
*  What does he do to make sure that this doesn't escalate even further and stop? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=272.48s)]
*  And Politico says among the options on the table for the Pentagon, striking Iranian [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=277.04s)]
*  personnel in Syria or Iraq or Iranian naval assets and the Persian Gulf, according to [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=281.0s)]
*  the officials, the Iranian government for its part has suggested that a strike on Iran [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=286.2s)]
*  itself would be a red line. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=290.92s)]
*  The officials suggested that once the president gave the go ahead, the retaliation would [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=292.76s)]
*  likely begin in the next couple of days and come in waves against a range of targets. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=297.6s)]
*  There are Republicans, Brett, who are saying that the Biden administration should strike [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=303.28000000000003s)]
*  inside Iran. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=309.24s)]
*  It's looking like the Biden administration will choose a different option. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=310.44s)]
*  What do you think about that? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=314.16s)]
*  Well, whatever we do, we have to reestablish deterrence. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=316.6s)]
*  Iran's an evil that just can't exist in our world today. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=318.8s)]
*  And I don't think airstrikes are good enough. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=321.72s)]
*  I mean, they have their use cases, but we've done it before and they're they're not good [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=324.32000000000005s)]
*  enough in this case. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  They're a bandaid on the larger issue. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=328.88s)]
*  Iran has proxy forces. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=330.92s)]
*  We should use our proxy forces because we could probably do it better. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=333.0s)]
*  Iran wants to play games with drones. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=336.52s)]
*  We should unleash our drones. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=338.12s)]
*  We have way better drone technology in our arsenal than they do, yet we don't use them. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=339.24s)]
*  They collect dust in our military stockpiles. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=343.4s)]
*  And so why aren't Iran's oil fields right now on fire? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=345.96s)]
*  They've done past strikes on our soldiers. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=349.8s)]
*  Where's the deterrence? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=352.0s)]
*  What's stopping them from doing it again? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=352.92s)]
*  I think we definitely need a strategic global campaign to strike a lot of these Quds Force [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=354.4s)]
*  officers that are running around the world, creating turmoil, operating within impunity. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=359.92s)]
*  They're they're setting up these global terrorist networks that are designed just specifically [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=364.72s)]
*  to target Americans. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=369.08000000000004s)]
*  And so I think our response should be a combination of striking targets in Syria, striking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=370.32s)]
*  targets in Iraq, in Iran. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=374.6s)]
*  But also, that's not simply good enough from the air. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=376.24s)]
*  We need a we need a campaign behind the scenes that unleashes our special operations, guides [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=379.76s)]
*  our intelligence officers to prioritize striking these operatives moving around the world [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=383.68s)]
*  with impunity. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=388.8s)]
*  There is an Iranian spy ship in the Red Sea that's giving Houthis information on what [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=390.44s)]
*  ships to attack, and some are suggesting that taking that ship down would be a good place [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=394.36s)]
*  to start. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=398.2s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=400.6s)]
*  I mean, because these lethal drone strikes are just going to continue, it's going to get [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=401.8s)]
*  worse and worse unless we do something, especially when it comes to the Houthis. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, I remember when when these groups were just small groups operating out of huts [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=408.32s)]
*  and we had a chance to actually do something about it years ago. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=413.56s)]
*  Many U.S. soldiers know exactly how the Houthis started and that we had a chance to [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=416.48s)]
*  actually stop them before they became the organization that that they are today. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  But again, it comes down to actually doing something instead of just talking and stopping [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=427.12s)]
*  this Iranian covert influence. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=430.56s)]
*  Yeah. And Brett, before I let you go, you mentioned that it was a technology failure, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=432.0s)]
*  why this drone was allowed to enter near the base and then strike, eventually killing these [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=435.84000000000003s)]
*  three soldiers and and wounding so many more. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=442.04s)]
*  But could it also be that this Iranian backed group had information on when our drone was [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=444.72s)]
*  supposed to return and, you know, scheduling? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  And then it leads to questions. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=454.96000000000004s)]
*  What else might they know about our troops in the Middle East? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=456.68s)]
*  Yeah, potentially. I mean, I think we have to get a lot more information about what exactly [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=460.68s)]
*  took place there. But regardless, we've seen their drones penetrate our defenses before. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=465.08000000000004s)]
*  So it may not be good enough to just simply have a technology bubble around our military [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=470.6s)]
*  bases. We actually need to go on the offense and do something. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=475.96s)]
*  Brett, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=478.84s)]
*  Thank you for your insight. Have a great day. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wJr0QGyT8Yw&t=481.28s)]
