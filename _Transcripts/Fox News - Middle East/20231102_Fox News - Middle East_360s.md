# No one expected the press to push Hamas propaganda: Kennedy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ)
*  The Washington Post is calling out President Biden for not taking death toll numbers reported [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=0.0s)]
*  by Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=5.96s)]
*  Why would he? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=7.36s)]
*  Last week, President Biden casted doubt on data provided by Gaza's Ministry of Health. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=9.28s)]
*  I have no notion that Palestinians are telling the truth about how many people are killed. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=14.36s)]
*  I'm sure innocents have been killed. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=20.0s)]
*  And it's the price of waging a war. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=22.12s)]
*  I have no confidence in the number that the Palestinians are using. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=24.12s)]
*  But leave it to the Washington Post to claim that the president's marks were misinformed. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=29.52s)]
*  The Post's chief fact-checker, his name is Glenn Kessler. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=34.92s)]
*  I speculate he's often napping. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=37.44s)]
*  He doesn't fact-check Dems, but he'll wake up to defend Hamas. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=39.44s)]
*  The Gaza Health Ministry has had a pretty good track record with its death estimates [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=42.64s)]
*  over the years, notwithstanding that it is part of the Hamas-run government. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=46.92s)]
*  And Biden is in a position to know that. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=52.879999999999995s)]
*  Kennedy, Glenn Kessler targets Republicans, often leaves Democrats alone, but come on, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=55.6s)]
*  he wants to defend Hamas, he wakes up, he goes after Biden. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=61.68s)]
*  I mean, we look at the White House press secretary delivering propaganda on behalf of the president, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=64.32000000000001s)]
*  right? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=69.96000000000001s)]
*  But you don't expect that a member of the press whose power is codified in the First [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  Amendment is going to be propagandizing for Hamas. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=76.36s)]
*  This one I really don't understand. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=80.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, you could have taken a pause because clearly the New York Times stepped in it repeatedly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=83.76s)]
*  when they came out and did their reporting, based their reporting on Hamas talking points. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  They got it wrong, they had to issue a retraction, and this is just one of those aspects where [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  you wonder what has happened with reporting. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  So much of it is completely upside down and it is ideologically driven. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=104.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, Emily, how can Mr. Kessler be so sure that Hamas is correct? [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=109.8s)]
*  Here's how. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=113.44s)]
*  He says the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs tracks deaths in the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=114.44s)]
*  conflict and has found the ministry's numbers to be reliable. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=119.0s)]
*  So the U.N. says it, who targets Israel, it must be true. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=121.68s)]
*  I mean, he can keep referencing liar after liar after liar and enemy after enemy after [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=125.16s)]
*  enemy, but we all know the whole point is it is not credible. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=130.12s)]
*  It is a farce, and therefore he is a farce for furthering those lies. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=133.88s)]
*  The New York Times remember when Hamas first invaded Israel, couldn't decide whether to [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=139.44s)]
*  call them terrorists or gunmen. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  When it first happened, they rightly identified them as Hamas terrorists and then they went [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=145.12s)]
*  on to call them gunmen after that. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=148.88s)]
*  And then not to mention the despicable, for example, assumption by the BBC during the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=150.92s)]
*  hospital incident where they said, surely, quote, it had to be Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=154.72s)]
*  And that was based only on their assumption because of the firepower. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=159.35999999999999s)]
*  The assumptions and the concepts being put forth here, all they serve to do is pull the [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=163.04s)]
*  curtain back on again that anti-Semitism and the fact that they are doing the work [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=168.56s)]
*  of Hamas for Hamas. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=172.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=174.16s)]
*  And Paul, good old Glenn. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=175.16s)]
*  OK, not only is it Hamas talking points, Rashida Tlaib talking points too. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  Listen to what he says about the hospital. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=180.76s)]
*  The source of the explosion remains unclear. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=182.84s)]
*  A Washington Post visual investigation found that the damage was not consistent with an [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=186.04s)]
*  airstrike and probably not consistent with artillery shell, but reporters could not conclusively [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=190.2s)]
*  determine the cause. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  U.S. intelligence has determined it. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=195.48000000000002s)]
*  The Associated Press has determined it, but WAPO can't. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=197.36s)]
*  Yeah, so they're picking a side. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  These are the same folks who bought into the 51 intelligence officers who signed the Hunter [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=202.08s)]
*  Laptop Letter and were supposed to take this guy seriously. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=207.0s)]
*  So you know, remember something here. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=209.8s)]
*  At some point you have to pick a side here and the Hamas caucus that's emerging on the [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=211.8s)]
*  campuses very clearly has a presence in Congress and very clearly has a presence in our media. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=216.16000000000003s)]
*  These likely folks who were very similar when they were in college graduated, they were [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=222.16000000000003s)]
*  interns, etc. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=227.0s)]
*  They've drank the same Kool-Aid and now they're in a position of power. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=228.0s)]
*  But at the end of the day, legally, Hamas is a terrorist group that designated by the [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=230.52s)]
*  U.S. government. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=235.88s)]
*  And what I don't understand is the following, and this is why the WAPO and New York Times [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=236.88s)]
*  and a lot of our media from where I sit are dropping the ball. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=241.56s)]
*  Why aren't we hearing the following? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=243.84s)]
*  We got 32 Americans dead, right? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=245.60000000000002s)]
*  We have at least 10 American hostages. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=247.92000000000002s)]
*  Hamas did it. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=250.0s)]
*  The leadership of Hamas resides in a nominal American ally, Qatar. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=251.28s)]
*  We have our biggest Middle East base there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=257.12s)]
*  We have at least six major universities with a major presence there. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=258.79999999999995s)]
*  We're probably half their economy. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  Imagine if after 9-11, UBL and Zawahiri lived in Canada. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=263.76s)]
*  Would we indict them? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=268.56s)]
*  Would we ask for their extradition? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=269.76s)]
*  Where is that request? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=271.4s)]
*  Where's the indictments? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=272.4s)]
*  Great point. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=273.4s)]
*  Indict Hamas' leadership and get them back here. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=274.4s)]
*  Yeah, that's a great question. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=276.59999999999997s)]
*  Look, I mean, you nailed it. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=278.23999999999995s)]
*  The United Nations today decided that it would give a prestigious job, the chair-ship of [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=281.52s)]
*  the human rights division, to Iran. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  That's happening as we're on the air. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=292.24s)]
*  That's going to be their position now. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=294.64s)]
*  They gave it to Iran. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=297.08s)]
*  Human rights. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=299.52s)]
*  They treat women like animals they want to just kill. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=300.52s)]
*  And then they hire terrorists around the world to be their proxies and come after us. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=304.29999999999995s)]
*  I mean, this is crazy. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=309.2s)]
*  They're on our soil with the ability to say the trash they say about beheading and killing [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  and wiping, annihilating all Jews off the planet. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=317.79999999999995s)]
*  And they want Christians too. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=322.03999999999996s)]
*  And anybody who's a soft Arab, whatever the heck that means. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=323.64s)]
*  On our soil, the UN, I asked Vivek Ramaswamy last hour, he said he'd get rid of it, pull [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=327.47999999999996s)]
*  us out. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  And it's like, pull us out, kick them out. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=333.23999999999995s)]
*  They're on our soil. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=334.64s)]
*  Amen. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=335.64s)]
*  Yeah, a good rule of thumb. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=336.64s)]
*  If Hamas puts babies in ovens, they should not be trusted. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=338.64s)]
*  They should not be trusted. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6tlUubpgHQ&t=342.8s)]
