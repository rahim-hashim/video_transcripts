# Tlaib faces two GOP censure resolutions over Israel-Hamas war comments
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8)
*  Back now with a pair of Republican lawmakers now pushing separate resolutions that censure [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=0.0s)]
*  far-left Michigan Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib for her controversial comments on Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=5.42s)]
*  But it's not just the GOP that's outraged as the Israel-Hamas war continues to widen [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  the divide within the Democratic Party. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=15.64s)]
*  So something we're watching in senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=18.68s)]
*  He's live on Capitol Hill with more. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=22.36s)]
*  Hi, Chad. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=24.28s)]
*  Dana, good morning. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=25.28s)]
*  The war in the Middle East is fracturing Democrats. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=26.76s)]
*  There's outrage over Rashida Tlaib for posting the inflammatory trope from the river to the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=29.4s)]
*  sea. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=34.36s)]
*  Israelis view that as a call to wipe them out. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=35.36s)]
*  The House could vote on two resolutions to sanction Tlaib today. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=38.2s)]
*  Some debates don't have two sides. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=43.68s)]
*  From the river to the sea means the destruction of Israel and everyone who's in it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=45.26s)]
*  Just like Mein Kampf is not a coloring book. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=49.44s)]
*  Congresswoman has a First Amendment right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=52.4s)]
*  She can say whatever she wants. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=53.62s)]
*  Some pro-Israeli Democrats are wrestling with progressives who back Palestinians. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=56.86s)]
*  Aides to liberal Democrat John Fetterman are divided over his move to stand foursquare [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=60.94s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=65.94s)]
*  But Indiana Democrat and Muslim Representative Andre Carson says Tlaib deserves to be heard. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=66.94s)]
*  That criticism should not go without an attempt to understand her point of view, her position, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=72.94s)]
*  where she comes from, the fact that she is Palestinian, the fact that she has seen injustice [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=79.94s)]
*  and inequity on her side. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=85.58s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene tried to censure Tlaib last week for supporting an anti-Israeli rally [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=89.7s)]
*  on Capitol Hill. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=94.7s)]
*  So two resolutions to censure Tlaib today, one from Greene and a new one from Rich McCormick [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=96.18s)]
*  after the latest dustup. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=101.86s)]
*  I think Congresswoman Greene realized that she wasn't as thoughtful in her resolution [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=103.78s)]
*  as she should have been. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=110.26s)]
*  Congressman McCormick was much more so careful of his language, protection of First Amendment, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=113.53999999999999s)]
*  and so we'll see which goes forward and how they go forward. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=119.25999999999999s)]
*  Now not to be outdone, California Democrat Sarah Jacobs introduced a resolution to censure [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=123.94s)]
*  Florida Republican Brian Mast. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=129.22s)]
*  He compared Palestinian civilians to Nazis. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1HG1rTy8l8&t=131.78s)]
