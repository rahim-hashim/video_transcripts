# ‘Iranian axis of resistance’ strike could come in several waves: Former CENTCOM commander
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA)
*  to General Joseph Rattel, the former U.S. Central Commanding General, kind enough to join us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=0.0s)]
*  General, that is a bit of an unusual strategy there to wait till after the Olympics to do [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=5.12s)]
*  something. I can understand that. But what do you make of just that? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  Well, thanks, Neil. It's great to be with you. Certainly, the Olympics could be a consideration, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=16.48s)]
*  but I actually think there's probably some other considerations here that are in play as well. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=21.44s)]
*  I think Iran has to think about the risk of failure. They failed the last time in terms [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=26.64s)]
*  of doing this. And another major failure of being able to accomplish any kind of military [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=31.2s)]
*  mission would be a setback for them. Second of all, I think they have to be concerned about the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=36.08s)]
*  Israeli response. I think there's no doubt that an Iranian or coordinated large-scale Iranian [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=41.84s)]
*  Axis of resistance attack will meet with an equally fierce response from Israel. So they've [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=49.12s)]
*  got to think their way through that. And then third, I think we have to entertain the idea that [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=56.24s)]
*  perhaps Iran and maybe some of its major partners like Hezbollah may have some divergent goals and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=61.28s)]
*  objectives here. There are different considerations for each of those. It's probably taken some time [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=67.68s)]
*  to work through all that. So I think certainly the Olympics is part of that, but I think there's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=72.56s)]
*  probably something more substantive to the reasons why they have not launched their strike yet. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=77.36s)]
*  You mentioned some of these proxies, Hezbollah to the north and Hamas, of course, a constant threat, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=84.56s)]
*  the Houthi rebels. I could extend that to these constant attacks on shipping interests in that [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=89.52s)]
*  neck of the woods as well. What if it's their responses that will be coming from those proxies [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=94.24s)]
*  and not directly Iran? And that's where Iran leaves it. Sure. Well, first among them, of course, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=99.6s)]
*  is Hezbollah. Hezbollah has literally hundreds of thousands of missiles and rockets that they [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=106.88s)]
*  can launch. They are much closer to Israel, so they could create much greater havoc and chaos [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=111.44s)]
*  and less time to respond for Israeli and other U.S. and other forces that may be participating [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=118.24s)]
*  in the defense. Certainly the other Shia groups, Shia militia groups, like those we've seen in Iraq [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=124.32s)]
*  and Syria, could launch attacks against U.S. bases or interests in the region to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=130.24s)]
*  disrupt it, to cause us to divert our attention over there. And then, of course, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=138.0s)]
*  the Houthis are really a wild card. They not only are trying to create [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=141.84s)]
*  effects in the Red Sea, but they do have capabilities that they can extend beyond the Red Sea, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=145.68s)]
*  just as we saw just a couple weeks ago in Tel Aviv. So all of the combined aspect of this, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=151.28s)]
*  I think, could create some real challenges. And it's likely that we're not just going to see one [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=157.2s)]
*  phase to this Iranian axis of resistance strike, but likely we'll see maybe a couple different [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=162.72s)]
*  waves of it. All right. We'll see, presumably after the Olympics, to your point. General, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=168.64s)]
*  very good seeing you. Thank you for your service to this country. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUbW6NC-7zA&t=174.39999999999998s)]
