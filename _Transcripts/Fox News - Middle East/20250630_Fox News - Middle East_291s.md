# Trump says more countries will join Abraham Accords: 'GROUNDBREAKING'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ)
*  Israel's strategic affairs minister expected to visit Washington today, where he will [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=0.0s)]
*  reportedly face pressure for the Trump administration to end the war in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=5.0s)]
*  Yesterday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's operation against Iran [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=9.8s)]
*  has opened up more opportunities for them, quote, first and foremost to rescue the hostages [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=14.32s)]
*  and defeat Hamas, and also broad regional possibilities. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  President Trump continuing to call for a ceasefire in Gaza and for a return of all hostages, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=23.36s)]
*  adding that more countries could be joining the Abraham Accords. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=28.8s)]
*  Has any other country suggested to you recently as a result of this that they want to join [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=33.56s)]
*  the Abraham Accords? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=40.56s)]
*  So we have some really great countries in there right now, and I think we're going to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=42.2s)]
*  start loading them up because Iran was the primary problem. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  White House press secretary Caroline Lovett has suggested Syria could also be one of those [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=52.04s)]
*  countries joining in. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=55.88s)]
*  And here to break all of this down is foreign affairs analyst and former George Washington, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  George W. Bush appointed U.S. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  Commissioner member Harvey, Harley Littman. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  Harley, thank you so much for joining us this morning. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=66.56s)]
*  So Iran has been sending a lot of mixed signals on what direction they're going to take their [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=68.67999999999999s)]
*  country. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=73.68s)]
*  So first of all, what are the chances in your estimation of the United States and Iran having [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=74.68s)]
*  some sort of discussion this week? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=79.88s)]
*  We're having a little bit of audio issues. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=82.6s)]
*  Let's see if we could pod him up. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=88.96s)]
*  Oh, we. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=90.52s)]
*  Iran is going to have discussions, and they're very clever negotiators. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=91.52s)]
*  And they just announced at the UN that they will enrich uranium no matter what international [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=98.28s)]
*  pressure happens, and they will do it indefinitely. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=104.08s)]
*  So clearly that sends a signal, as President Trump said just a moment ago on your newscast [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=107.8s)]
*  that Iran is the problem. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=113.84s)]
*  But there is a solution here, which is the Abraham Accords. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=116.0s)]
*  And what a lot of people may not realize is the Abraham Accords means peace with your [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=119.96s)]
*  neighbors. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=123.84s)]
*  What President Trump is doing is going to transform the Middle East in a way that we [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=125.24s)]
*  haven't seen in over 100 years. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=129.64s)]
*  You have Lebanon, Syria and Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=132.06s)]
*  I arrived in Israel today. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=135.26s)]
*  I'm meeting with the American Ambassador Mike Huckabee this Wednesday at two o'clock. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=137.6s)]
*  And I'm meeting with Israeli ministers in the next two days because big things are going [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=142.0s)]
*  on in the Middle East right now. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=146.28s)]
*  They certainly are. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=148.28s)]
*  And on the Abraham Accords front, Harley, the possibility of Saudi Arabia and even Syria [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=149.28s)]
*  potentially entering into these accords. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=155.52s)]
*  I mean, just six months ago, especially on the Syria front, no way anybody thought that [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=157.68s)]
*  was possible. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=162.08s)]
*  Is it now? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=163.08s)]
*  It's more than possible. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  It's likely to happen. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=166.84s)]
*  I predict it will happen. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=167.84s)]
*  And it's due to President Trump because President Trump showed extraordinary leadership and [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=169.6s)]
*  courage in challenging Iran in a way that no American president has ever done. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=174.68s)]
*  And he successfully attacked Iran. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=180.16s)]
*  And Iran was defeated by close coordination between the United States and its close ally, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=182.6s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=187.76s)]
*  And the nations in the Middle East saw that, that they could count on America as a reliable [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=188.76s)]
*  ally and they could work with America to transform the region. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=192.4s)]
*  So this is groundbreaking. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=196.52s)]
*  There's nothing like this that we've seen in our lifetime. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=198.08s)]
*  And it's going to make dramatic changes in this part of the world that's going to uplift [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=201.08s)]
*  the life of people living in Arab countries that have been suffering so much. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=205.68s)]
*  So according to an Israeli media report, Israel is prepared to end the war in Gaza and then [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=211.20000000000002s)]
*  turn control over to four Arab countries. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=217.26000000000002s)]
*  Do you think that this is what the likelihood is going to be, that this is going to be the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=221.28s)]
*  outcome? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=226.4s)]
*  And if so, what would that mean for the hostages that are still in Gaza? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=227.4s)]
*  I do think it's a likely outcome. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=232.68s)]
*  This is part of the reason why I'm here today. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=234.66s)]
*  I flew in this morning. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=236.56s)]
*  And I think what will the result of this will be the freeing of the hostages. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=238.68s)]
*  This is a primary condition for Israel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=243.22s)]
*  And President Trump has been a champion of these poor people who have been savagely [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=245.84s)]
*  beaten and tortured and kidnapped into Gaza. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=251.44s)]
*  So I've never been this hopeful in my life that something is changing in international [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=254.74s)]
*  relations, especially in the Middle East for the good. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=259.72s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=263.92s)]
*  It really is. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=264.92s)]
*  It certainly is. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=265.92s)]
*  Harley, we're going to have you back on to talk about all of this after you meet with [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=266.92s)]
*  the ambassador and Israeli officials. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=271.78000000000003s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us ahead of those discussions. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=274.22s)]
*  And we will check back in with you very soon. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=277.02s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=278.5s)]
*  Harley Lippmann, we appreciate it. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rr0u7pW9NiQ&t=279.5s)]
