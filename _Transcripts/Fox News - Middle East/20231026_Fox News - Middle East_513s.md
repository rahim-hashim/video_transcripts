# Biden under fire for Iran policy: 'Where exactly is the red line?'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg)
*  Let's turn now to the Middle East and the tensions between the United States and Iran are rapidly getting hotter by the day [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=0.0s)]
*  More than 20 Americans have been injured by drone attacks on their military bases inside Iraq and Syria [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=7.76s)]
*  So they are targeting our military personnel and we knew this was coming and they have the proxy assets to do it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  Iranian-backed groups have hit us at least 13 times in just the past week [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=23.2s)]
*  Iran already warned Israel it would attack if they invaded Gaza and now President Biden is [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=30.16s)]
*  Upping the ante at least with his words issuing a stark warning toward the Islamic Republic [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=37.12s)]
*  That the United States will not tolerate attacks on American troops overseas [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=42.2s)]
*  My warning to the ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops we will respond [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=48.56s)]
*  And he should be prepared [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=55.68s)]
*  There's nothing to do with Israel [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=58.24s)]
*  Marti son the president has been hit in recent days for more words than action and what I am prayerful about is that [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=60.76s)]
*  He's taking some great action that they cooked up in the sense situation [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=67.2s)]
*  Room with a with a bevy of Pentagon officials and generals and they just can't tell us. Well, I hope so [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=71.2s)]
*  I mean keep in mind that he's inching up closer and closer to Donald Trump's policy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=77.42s)]
*  Which was he drew a red line with Iran that he said if you kill a sing you or one of your proxies kills a single [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=81.7s)]
*  American we will take we will take military action against our men and women have been hurt [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=88.22s)]
*  We're told at least two dozen. So what is this? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=92.46000000000001s)]
*  We got 30 Americans dead in Israel people taken hostage and there been no consequences for it at all [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=97.7s)]
*  Trump's Trump when when Trump was president he drew that red line and he said to the Iranians if you kill an American [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=103.34s)]
*  We're gonna hit we're gonna strike at you and you're gonna pay the price and when they crossed that red line [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=108.9s)]
*  He killed Qasem Soleimani and then he told the Iranians and he I have the tweet [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=113.08000000000001s)]
*  He said I've picked out 52 targets in honor of the 52 hostages you took in 1979 [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=117.22s)]
*  And if you retaliate, I'm gonna take you [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=122.04s)]
*  I'm gonna I'm gonna strike Iran proper and we hit him hard and I'm gonna hit him fast and they back down and not only [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=124.06s)]
*  Did they back down peace broke out? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=129.3s)]
*  He signed not one not two not three, but four Abraham Accords, right? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=131.3s)]
*  So the lesson is when bullies back down when they face overwhelming force and the reason why Iran is not backing down right now [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=135.9s)]
*  is because they think that Joe Biden is more fearful of escalation than they are and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=142.78s)]
*  So he needs to draw a draw a serious credible red line [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=146.34s)]
*  He needs to reiterate the Trump red line and said it's and if you touch a single hostage if one of those [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=150.12s)]
*  The Hamas is holding hostages. We hold you Ayatollah responsible for their lives [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=154.5s)]
*  If anything happens to them, you're gonna pay the price not Hamas [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=159.06s)]
*  You know what I am concerned about and and I appreciate you so much taking us back through what we all lived through as [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=162.12s)]
*  Americans during the Trump administration because he also holds the distinction in the open era and this current century of being the only [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=170.12s)]
*  President that Russia didn't go to war with one of its neighbors under [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=177.16s)]
*  Kelly what what concerns me now though is with this president if the expectation is to take action [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=181.88s)]
*  What would that be after all of the death and carnage that we've already seen this red line [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=189.24s)]
*  I mean his former boss Obama said it was a red line with Syria and that turned out to be an invisible red line that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=194.08s)]
*  Maybe only Obama could see right that was the cautionary tale of red lines and Obama 2012 you said it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=199.92000000000002s)]
*  He drew a red line on the use of chemical weapons in Syria went on enforced [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=206.8s)]
*  And what did Vladimir Putin do Vladimir Putin went in in support of Assad Vladimir Putin and went into Crimea [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=210.34s)]
*  Vladimir Putin then went into Ukraine didn't happen on Trump's watch for the reasons mark laid out [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  But I love that you ask is the red line perforated is it dotted? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=220.5s)]
*  I mean, I think that's such a vivid way to describe what is happening here because Blinken laid out that red line before the United [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=224.5s)]
*  Nations Biden underscored it yesterday, but to your point we've already had many service members injured from Iran [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=229.95999999999998s)]
*  So where exactly is the red line? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=236.34s)]
*  It seems pretty weak at this moment and by the way Trump enforced Obama's red line twice on chemical weapons [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=238.44s)]
*  If you use chemical weapons, we're gonna strike you Obama didn't do it Trump did it twice and then they kept using them [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=244.08s)]
*  So it didn't deter them from using them in the future. They kept doing it red lines are an interesting communications tactic [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=249.16s)]
*  They can often be a diplomatic and a military deterrence tactic [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=255.44s)]
*  I think the conversation happening right now look Biden and Blinken have both been very clear that Iran should be on notice the conversation [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=258.24s)]
*  I think they're having with the Israelis right now is how do we prevent Iran from? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=264.88s)]
*  Encouraging Hezbollah to undertake sort of a full-scale attack on Israel on a second front how to not get more Iranian [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=269.40000000000003s)]
*  Proxies being more aggressive against against Israel right now while Israel focuses on Gaza and that's it [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=276.48s)]
*  That's a tough balance right and I can guarantee you that in the intelligence community [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=281.44s)]
*  There's lots of covert ways to hold Iran accountable [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=284.88s)]
*  I think those of us who've worked in government and who haven't are familiar with some of them [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=287.36s)]
*  Some of them have been reported publicly [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=290.92s)]
*  So I think that Iran right now is probably a little bit nervous because Israel I [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=292.32s)]
*  Think they probably are I think the president the United States has made clear this feels like a very different moment in the region [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=297.92s)]
*  And there are a lot of people a lot of countries including some of those Abraham Accord countries who are also very focused on Iran [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  The Arab states of course also who have also made very clear that if Iran [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=308.44s)]
*  You know gets more aggressive and gets their proxies to be more aggressive. They will also take steps as well [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=312.72s)]
*  So it is a very [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=317.74s)]
*  And a tinderbox even more so than it was two weeks ago three weeks ago [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=319.52s)]
*  And I think our goal should be to tell Iran that we will hold them responsible [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=322.96s)]
*  But to not ignite a further conflict that puts Israel at risk. So you're in favor with words over action [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=327.52s)]
*  Decides if they make it wider Iran, I [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=334.88s)]
*  Mean has more than [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=339.0s)]
*  Party gets a vote in this war [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=341.56s)]
*  Every party gets a vote in this war and I think that words actually do matter in conflict [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=343.59999999999997s)]
*  Well, the people on the ground don't get a vote [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=347.47999999999996s)]
*  I hear what you're saying and I think I just wish that I felt more confidence in that [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=350.0s)]
*  I feel like with this president right now who keeps saying don't don't be prepared [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=354.68s)]
*  We haven't seen that the actual deterrent consequence of that [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=359.48s)]
*  I spoke about this yesterday that I just haven't seen a demonstration by the United States [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=362.5s)]
*  To me to little old me that gives me faith and confidence that these warnings actually hold water [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=367.36s)]
*  So I'm pretty confident that our enemies are laughing all the way to the bank too and more insidiously [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=372.56s)]
*  They're laughing all the way to their attacks and I point to the fact that you know [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=378.56s)]
*  When we when we meld behavior with words as well, you know [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=382.35999999999996s)]
*  This president nominated Jack Lew to be ambassador to Israel two years after he assumed the commander-in-chief position [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=385.15999999999997s)]
*  So if we want to talk about who is arguably an Iran apologist [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=391.94s)]
*  That's who is in place right now to be our ambassador between us and Israel [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=395.18s)]
*  You know the Pentagon reports that 21 US service members have been injured in attacks by Iranian proxies [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=400.26s)]
*  Including 19 diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. How much is too much? How much is enough? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=406.24s)]
*  Secretary Austin testified that we were attacked 83 times [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=412.72s)]
*  Responded four times and now 13 times against US soldiers in Syria and Iraq in the last week and still [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=416.64000000000004s)]
*  Just words from this president. So I personally have no confidence no faith in him as commander-in-chief [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=423.68s)]
*  my fear and my [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=429.52000000000004s)]
*  Anxiety deepened with my loved ones being deployed under his watch and I can't imagine [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=431.59999999999997s)]
*  How other families feel you laid that out so beautifully Murray just a quick word from you because I mean you you made the opposite [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=436.62s)]
*  Argument, are you okay with us just sitting by? Well, I actually didn't say we should just sit by [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=443.08s)]
*  I guess my question to Emily would be what do you want him to be doing right now? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=447.62s)]
*  Like I don't think any of us want to be in some sort of fighting for our people [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=450.79999999999995s)]
*  What does that mean? We said we do is America that we wouldn't let it happen again [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=454.0s)]
*  I don't think we want to get in a hot conflict with Iran [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=457.72s)]
*  I just I think that is not good for US security and that's not good for Israeli security [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=460.72s)]
*  You know how three days ago the Pentagon said that there was no direct orders from the supreme leader, you know allegedly [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=464.40000000000003s)]
*  So what do you want us to be doing? So my point is what do you want the US to be doing right now? [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=471.0s)]
*  We were tallied physically. Yeah, I could you think we should strike Iran. You think we should not military [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=474.8s)]
*  They're the ones who strike who fired at the base even Trump did that before [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=482.92s)]
*  Every single no, we're not we haven't hit cut the air firing firing with impunity [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  That our base yeah, we are not America's when America gets shot at and America doesn't fire back that America's seen as weak [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=492.56s)]
*  Simple. All right, last word enforce maximum pressure campaign like Trump did freeze the six billion permanently [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=498.48s)]
*  There's all sorts of things you could do short of going into Iran or having a military conflict [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=504.6s)]
*  We're not doing any can we stop them from selling all that oil and making all that money? All right [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJXLSFpb1jg&t=508.32000000000005s)]
