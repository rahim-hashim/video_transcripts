# They won't answer this very simple question: Tom Cotton
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg)
*  Hey Steve, great interview. A live look at Gaza City as America's bravest ally continues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, live look at Gaza. Israeli counter-strikes continue. Just moments ago, the IDF announced [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=7.0s)]
*  that sirens are sounding across central Israel, a very fluid situation across the country. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=13.32s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about fighting war against terrorism firsthand. GOP Senator Tom [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=18.16s)]
*  Cotton served in Afghanistan and sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee. He joins [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=24.44s)]
*  us now. Senator, I want to talk about this $6 billion in the president's speech yesterday. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=29.08s)]
*  A lot of heart there, so I commend him for that, addressing what's going on in Israel. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=36.76s)]
*  But he did not address the state's number one sponsor of terrorism, which is Iran. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=41.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, Iran is the world's worst state sponsor of terrorism. Hamas wouldn't exist in the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=48.28s)]
*  scale and the brutality that it does without Iran's support. And President Biden just last [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=52.08s)]
*  month freed up $6 billion to Iran to use. Now, it may be the case that it hasn't been [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=57.04s)]
*  released yet or it's being held offshore, but that obviously emboldened Iran that America [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=62.04s)]
*  would pay ransom for five American hostages. And it freed up $6 billion of their own money [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=67.52s)]
*  to continue to support groups like Hamas and Hezbollah. And you know, they spent the weekend [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=72.76s)]
*  saying how not a penny of that money has been spent. Well, that's great news. That means [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  that we can refreeze the money and not send it to Iran. I'm very worried that they refuse [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=80.16s)]
*  to answer that simple question, that it suggests that in fact they can't plan to go forward [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=85.12s)]
*  with that foolish decision and allow Iran to access that $6 billion, just like they're [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=88.80000000000001s)]
*  allowing Iran to ship tens of billions of dollars worth of oil by not enforcing sanctions. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=92.92s)]
*  All that money is doing is fueling Iran's campaign of terror across the region. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  What is the holdup on freezing the money? Yeah, I can't imagine why they're refusing [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=102.92s)]
*  to say they're going to freeze it now unless they simply don't want to. They want to continue [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=108.96000000000001s)]
*  with the failed Obama-Biden policy of conciliating with Iran, of appeasing Iran, of trying to [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=113.08s)]
*  elevate Iran to achieve some kind of false balance in the Middle East between Iran on [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=119.08s)]
*  the one hand and Israel and its Arab friends on the other hand. What we need right now [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=123.72s)]
*  is strength and resolution. We need to stand by Israel and we need to make it clear to [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=129.0s)]
*  Iran and Hezbollah and Hamas that we will not tolerate this kind of atrocity that we've [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=133.36s)]
*  seen in Israel. Senator, we're looking at live footage right now of Gaza City and the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=139.3s)]
*  shelling that's going on. And there's been this effort and you served, you know what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=145.16000000000003s)]
*  happens at war, but you already see it in some of the media and you see some of it in [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=150.74s)]
*  liberal publications to paint Israel as the enemy and the bullies. Can you explain to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=155.9s)]
*  us the goal of Hamas from a propaganda standpoint? Well, Hamas' very charter says it's dedicated [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=162.62s)]
*  to the destruction of Israel and the death of Jews. Look what happened over the weekend. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=169.54s)]
*  Babies beheaded, women raped and mutilated in the streets, families burned alive to terrorize [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=174.45999999999998s)]
*  Israel. And Hamas is not just a terrorist group, it's also a governing entity that purports [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=181.57999999999998s)]
*  to govern Gaza, which is larger than some sovereign nation, which has two million people. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=186.89999999999998s)]
*  What Israel has to do is what we did to Imperial Japan or Nazi Germany after Pearl Harbor. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=191.5s)]
*  It has to completely destroy Hamas as a terrorist group, as a governing entity and as a social [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=198.62s)]
*  movement. Anything less will leave Israel exposed in the future to exactly this kind [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=203.98s)]
*  of brutal atrocity. It will also signal that if we don't back up Israel in their campaign [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=210.22s)]
*  to destroy Hamas, signal even more to Iran and its proxies to say nothing of China and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=215.9s)]
*  Russia that the United States is not strong and resolute in the defense of our friends [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=221.02s)]
*  and our own citizens since we had more than a dozen Americans killed and a couple dozen [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=226.3s)]
*  apparently are missing or held hostage. Senator, I only got about 15 seconds. At what point [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=231.26000000000002s)]
*  should America's armed forces be involved in this conflict? Well, Israel always wants [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=235.58s)]
*  to fight its own wars, but we should provide them every support they need, not just in [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=241.02s)]
*  missiles and rockets and other munitions, but mission planning and intelligence and [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=245.5s)]
*  so forth. We also may need American forces to help liberate our citizens. Those are our [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=248.66000000000003s)]
*  responsibility. They're not Israel's responsibility. They're America's responsibility. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=254.26s)]
*  We can't have another Kayla Mueller situation. Senator, thanks so much for joining the program. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZJIBc8Jrsg&t=257.38s)]
