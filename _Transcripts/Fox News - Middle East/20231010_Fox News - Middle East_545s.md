# Gen. Jack Keane: Biden has to revisit his entire strategy on Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE)
*  Well, of course, you might have caught on air Jake Sullivan, the National Security Advisor, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=0.0s)]
*  outlining what the United States is going to do right now in response to this, following [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=4.36s)]
*  up on the president's address. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=8.06s)]
*  It wasn't so much his kind of vague comments about Iran and its responsibility for this [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=9.84s)]
*  attack or helping in this attack on the part of Hamas, but his answer to a question that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=15.6s)]
*  concerns something far bigger. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=20.68s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=22.84s)]
*  What circumstances would you put American forces on the ground to help out? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=23.84s)]
*  At this point, that is not something that is under planning. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=29.32s)]
*  What we are focused on when we talk about sending experts, it is people who can work [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=34.04s)]
*  on intelligence, who can work on overall planning, who can work on coordination with the Israeli [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=38.88s)]
*  government. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=43.6s)]
*  We are not currently sending forces to Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=44.6s)]
*  And I'll leave it at that for now. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=50.36s)]
*  I'll leave it at that for now. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=51.36s)]
*  That raised a lot of questions and a lot of curious responses from people wondering, is [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=53.28s)]
*  that ultimately where this could be going, American troops on the ground in Israel? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=57.32s)]
*  General Jack Keene with us. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=61.96s)]
*  General, what do you think? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=62.96s)]
*  Well, I'm stunned by the president's speech and also by Jake Sullivan's response to questions [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=65.24s)]
*  here. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=72.84s)]
*  The president gave a heartfelt support, certainly, of the suffering that has taken place and [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=73.84s)]
*  the need to support Israel to see this operation that they're going to conduct through to its [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=79.03999999999999s)]
*  completion. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=84.88s)]
*  But he never, ever mentioned Iran, who is directing their proxies to attack Israel and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  has been doing so for 40 years. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=92.8s)]
*  And they admit that Iran is broadly complicit, as Jake Sullivan said, in funding, in training [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=96.28s)]
*  and supporting Hamas. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=104.11999999999999s)]
*  But we don't have any specific confirmation that they were involved in the planning or [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=107.16s)]
*  coordination of this attack. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=112.47999999999999s)]
*  What he should have said, he said, we can make the assumption, based on Iran's previous [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=114.48s)]
*  activities, that they directed this, helped plan it, helped coordinate it and helped achieve [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=119.75999999999999s)]
*  the success. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=127.2s)]
*  And therefore, we are going to support Israel, but we're also going to make certain that [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=128.88s)]
*  if any, any American hostage loses their life at the hands of the Hamas, then Iran, we're [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=135.64s)]
*  going to react to that. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=144.28s)]
*  You will pay the price for that and direct that attention to the Iranian leadership. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=146.4s)]
*  The same thing. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=153.0s)]
*  The president made this speech and made a clear point about the expansion of the war, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=154.52s)]
*  and he did it in reference to the aircraft carrier and military response that's in [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=160.88s)]
*  the region, and it's there to deter an expansion of the war. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=164.88s)]
*  What are we really talking about here? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=170.8s)]
*  We're talking about Lebanon, Hezbollah, really opening up a northern front, or possibly [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=172.12s)]
*  Syria, et cetera. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=177.12s)]
*  But mostly it's all about Lebanon. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=178.84s)]
*  And he said, don't. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=181.68s)]
*  Why didn't he come forward and say, and if you do, then you have forced me to take action [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=183.08s)]
*  in support of Israel? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=189.44s)]
*  Now, we would not take military action in support of Israel if they didn't ask us to [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=190.76s)]
*  help them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=195.96s)]
*  They have never asked us since 1948, in every confrontation they've had. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=197.9s)]
*  They've been able to deal with it on their own. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=202.3s)]
*  But if they want our help, we would be there, and I would have put that out there so the [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  Iranians understand it. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=208.66s)]
*  That is the deterrence, not just having the ships there, but what? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=210.54000000000002s)]
*  Deterrence takes two things. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=215.58s)]
*  One, the capability. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=216.58s)]
*  Your enemy's got to see it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=218.38s)]
*  Secondly, they've got to believe you're going to use it. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=220.18s)]
*  Those two things together gets you deterrence. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=223.9s)]
*  And he left out, I'm going to use it. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=226.94s)]
*  And that is the problem I'm having. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=230.06s)]
*  The president needs to revisit his entire strategy dealing with Iran, Neil. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=231.78s)]
*  The appeasement and the containment strategy is not working. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=236.74s)]
*  He's got to confront them, the only thing they understand. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=240.54000000000002s)]
*  Really slap the sanctions on them. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=245.1s)]
*  Pull back the $6 billion. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=247.14000000000001s)]
*  And then, certainly, in dealing with the specifics of this, do the couple things I just mentioned [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=250.46s)]
*  so this thing doesn't get worse for the United States citizens there, but also for [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=261.7s)]
*  the Israeli citizens in terms of the expansion of the war. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=267.18s)]
*  Be unequivocal. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=270.34000000000003s)]
*  Be clear. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=271.74s)]
*  This is a time when you have to find your spine and your strong moral compass and stand [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=272.92s)]
*  up for stability, security, and you've got to be willing to confront these adversaries. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=279.6s)]
*  So let me ask you, and I wish we had more time, General, but what was the strategy for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=285.76s)]
*  Hamas? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=290.72s)]
*  It surely had to anticipate the sweeping response that Israel is offering right now, and that [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=291.72s)]
*  it would be what Hamas did times 10. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=299.32s)]
*  So whether complicit with Iran or not, what was the thinking that went into that, unless [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=303.28s)]
*  it's encouraging a widening of the war, bringing Hezbollah into it, bringing more, and we [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=309.12s)]
*  got these reports of missile attacks from Syria into it, I don't know, but the strategy [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=314.8s)]
*  escapes me here. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=321.15999999999997s)]
*  Well, one of the basic strategies they've always had is they want a strong military [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=324.16s)]
*  response from Israel in the Gaza Strip. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=330.12s)]
*  That it would unite the Arab world, right? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=334.2s)]
*  Right, and they want the casualties. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=337.08s)]
*  This is the horror of Hamas. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=339.16s)]
*  You know, they expose the civilian population there, that they're the government, that [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=341.2s)]
*  they're designed to protect, but they hide themselves in that population. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=348.32s)]
*  They weaponize their factories underneath mosques and schools, and then when the Israelis [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=353.06s)]
*  are coming with their guns, they want that civilian population casualty rate to go up. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=358.6s)]
*  They want the international community to condemn the Israelis. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=364.66s)]
*  I mean, how the hypocrisy and the horror associated with that, these are their people, and they [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=367.7s)]
*  actually want high casualty rates. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=374.74s)]
*  That is, I think, one of the purposes here. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=377.64s)]
*  In 16 years, they've never done anything like we have seen in the first two days of this. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=381.54s)]
*  They know that's going to get a strong response from the Israelis. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=386.82s)]
*  They want it, because their people are going to suffer. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=390.22s)]
*  Well, as I'm talking to you, General, we're seeing explosions going on in Gaza City right [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=393.82s)]
*  now of there had been talk of a land war, you know, getting boots on the ground on the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=396.82s)]
*  part of Israel to deal with this in Gaza. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=401.06s)]
*  They'd even put out warnings to Palestinians in the area that this is coming, whether this [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=403.5s)]
*  is the beginning of that. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=408.7s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=409.90000000000003s)]
*  But what's the next stage of this, as you see it? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=411.82s)]
*  Well, they're staging and preparing to conduct a military incursion into Gaza. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=415.14s)]
*  And their purpose here is completely different than what they've said before. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=422.82s)]
*  Before it was always going hard, going fast, and push them back for a number of years before [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=427.46000000000004s)]
*  they can do this again. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=432.34000000000003s)]
*  Kill as many leaders and as many fighters as you can, destroy the missiles, and once [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=434.18s)]
*  you can get your hands on of any value in the tunnels and get out. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=438.64000000000004s)]
*  Get out before the entire international community is condemning their actions. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=442.32000000000005s)]
*  This time, what the prime minister has said, he's going to change out the political entity, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=447.24s)]
*  which is Hamas, that governs Gaza. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=453.36s)]
*  That means he's going to bring in Fatah, someone else, and then he's going to destroy [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=456.5s)]
*  the entire network, which means the leaders, the fighters, all of the military infrastructure. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=460.96000000000004s)]
*  And he's going to stay there until that mission is completed. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=467.5s)]
*  They have never assigned that mission to themselves before. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=470.76s)]
*  This will take weeks and months, not the 10 days, two weeks that has happened in the fast, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=473.94s)]
*  a hard and fast approach. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=479.22s)]
*  This is going to be slow. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=481.2s)]
*  It's going to require patience. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qURaJCN_WCE&t=482.2s)]
