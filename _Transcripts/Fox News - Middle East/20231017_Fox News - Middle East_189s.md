# 'DISCRIMINATION': Professor urges law firms against hiring anti-Israel students
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 17, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ)
*  Well, as college students across the United States hold rallies and give statements against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel blaming Israel for the deadly attacks carried out by Hamas, one University of California [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=8.6s)]
*  Berkeley law professor says the adults need to step in writing, don't hire my anti-Semitic [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  law students, urging law firms and companies to stop hiring student activists who don't [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=22.42s)]
*  condemn terrorism. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=29.36s)]
*  Professor Stephen Solomon joins us from California right now. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  Professor, good morning to you. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=34.8s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=36.8s)]
*  Okay, so why did you write this great op-ed in the Wall Street Journal about don't hire [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=37.8s)]
*  my anti-Semitic law student? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=43.32s)]
*  Well, you don't need a graduate degree to know that you shouldn't be endorsing hate [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=45.76s)]
*  and murder. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  And the massacre in Israel was horrific. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=52.6s)]
*  What I'm saying is for law school employers, if your students, the students that you're [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=56.36s)]
*  hiring to represent your clients have endorsed or advocate hate and murder and anti-Semitism, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=63.239999999999995s)]
*  don't hire them. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=71.32s)]
*  You don't want them to be representing your clients and you don't want them to be part [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=72.32s)]
*  of your group. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=76.32s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=77.32s)]
*  At your school last year, law students for justice in Palestine voted to ban any pro-Israeli [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=78.32s)]
*  speaker from any events at college. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=86.16000000000001s)]
*  What message did that send? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=89.4s)]
*  Well, they didn't more than that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=91.48s)]
*  They said anyone who believes in an Israeli state should not be allowed to speak or supports [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=93.56s)]
*  an Israeli state. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  And as Jews, and I'm Jewish, this is our homeland. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=102.2s)]
*  It's our identity. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=106.56s)]
*  And so essentially what they're saying is we're not going to allow Jews in our organizations. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=108.12s)]
*  Even our dean said, look, this would prevent me from speaking. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  And this is part of the attitude on college campuses that allowed this massacre to happen. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=119.64s)]
*  It treats Jews as different. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=126.60000000000001s)]
*  It's discrimination. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=129.12s)]
*  And frankly, law students should know better. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=130.12s)]
*  Indeed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  And in fact, last week, I believe it was, a New York University law student had a job [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  rescinded from a great big, very prestigious firm, Winston and Strawn, because of a statement [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=141.16000000000003s)]
*  they put out essentially supporting Hamas. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=146.36s)]
*  And it was very anti-Israeli. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  You think law firms should ask about a student's background before they hire them, right? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=152.0s)]
*  I think they do already. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=159.32000000000002s)]
*  I don't think this is asking to do anything more than do what you're doing already, which [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=161.28s)]
*  is you wouldn't hire someone who advocates discrimination against African-Americans. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=165.56s)]
*  You would check their social media. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=171.48s)]
*  You shouldn't be hiring law students who've endorsed and advocate [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=174.11999999999998s)]
*  a terrorist organization that's murdered over a thousand people. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=178.12s)]
*  Indeed. He's a professor at University of California, Berkeley. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=182.76s)]
*  Stephen Solomon, thank you very much. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkBCab0DjUQ&t=187.32s)]
