# 'FINAL OUTCOME': IDF veteran says every single Hamas officer needs to be 'eliminated'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw)
*  Well, Eric and Greg, right now we're going to bring in Lieutenant Colonel Avital Libovitch. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=0.0s)]
*  She served more than 20 years in the Israeli Defense Forces, many of it as a spokesperson. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=4.24s)]
*  She is now the director of the advocacy group American Jewish Committee. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=10.620000000000001s)]
*  So I will call you Colonel Libovitch. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=15.16s)]
*  And if you could talk to us about this IDF strategy in this new phase of war, what can [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=16.6s)]
*  you tell us? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=22.96s)]
*  So the main goal of the war is the number one, to defend Israel and not to return to [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=25.04s)]
*  the same situation Israel has been facing since really 2001. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=31.08s)]
*  That was actually the first year when rockets started flying from Gaza into Israel, so 22 [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=36.8s)]
*  years of rocket firing. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=42.72s)]
*  But it's even more than that. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=43.72s)]
*  Hamas has one goal, to wipe out Israel. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=45.76s)]
*  They call on their charter Jews pigs, animals. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=49.34s)]
*  We don't have the right to exist here, and we want to make sure, Israel wants to make [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=53.4s)]
*  sure that this changes, that Hamas is no longer controlling the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=58.16s)]
*  And the second goal is to return the 229 hostages home. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=63.6s)]
*  In order to do that, it isn't sufficient to only have air force raids. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=69.24s)]
*  That's not going to get these two goals. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=74.88s)]
*  That's the reason why the expansion of the operation has been taking place since yesterday. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=77.02s)]
*  And you will be seeing a lot of activity on the ground, artillery, special units, commandos, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=83.24s)]
*  and also special units from the sea. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  And this, I hope, and we all hope here in Israel, will bring us to the final outcome [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=93.52s)]
*  of the war. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=98.69999999999999s)]
*  And what is that final outcome? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=101.6s)]
*  What would it look like from your experience? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=103.72s)]
*  Well, we cannot afford to continue when Hamas is controlling Gaza. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=109.32s)]
*  And in order to change the authority in Gaza, for example, to the Palestinian Authority, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=116.0s)]
*  which that would be the acceptable solution, we need to make sure that every single Hamas [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=121.64s)]
*  officer, whether junior or senior, is eliminated. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=128.72s)]
*  We need to make sure that any terror infrastructure inside Gaza, whether it be storages of rockets, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=133.48s)]
*  launchers, underground tunnels crossing the borders into Israel, different facilities [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=141.32s)]
*  used for terror, drones, we have to make sure that all of these facilities are eliminated. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=148.2s)]
*  And in order to do that, we have to work very carefully. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=155.56s)]
*  Yeah, and Prime Minister Netanyahu just said what you are saying, that you will destroy [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=160.28s)]
*  Hamas and save hostages. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=165.35999999999999s)]
*  So, and you said you have to work very strategically, because what will IDF do to locate and extract [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=167.68s)]
*  American and dual national citizens who are being held hostage? [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=174.56s)]
*  How do you navigate that? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=178.51999999999998s)]
*  Well, I think that this relates to a broader question, and this is the very good and close [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=180.2s)]
*  strategic relations Israel maintains with the U.S. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  We have seen here, we welcomed with open arms President Biden and Minister Blinken and Lloyd [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=190.44s)]
*  Austin, who were here and spoke great words of solidarity. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=199.32s)]
*  So the conversations are very close between the countries. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=203.8s)]
*  And I believe that there will be a solution for those holding dual citizenships. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=207.4s)]
*  But please keep in mind, we are right now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=213.48000000000002s)]
*  We are fighting the war of survival. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=216.23999999999998s)]
*  So we need to continue and defend ourselves. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  Just two minutes before I came here to the broadcast, there was another rocket attack, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=220.76s)]
*  half an hour from where I'm sitting here in my living room. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=226.16s)]
*  So we are still right in the midst of ongoing defense. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=229.11999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  And I understand that you don't have a specific answer in terms of how the hostages will be [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=234.35999999999999s)]
*  released and hopefully saved and gotten out of there alive. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=239.64s)]
*  It appears that the prime minister and the defense minister were saying that they were [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=244.04000000000002s)]
*  going to put this pressure on, this initial pressure, in hopes that somehow Hamas will [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  be willing to release these hostages, at least some of them. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=251.64000000000001s)]
*  I do have one last question for you regarding your other, the other role that you play, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=255.12s)]
*  which is the director of American Jewish Committee. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=260.72s)]
*  And I wanted to ask you, is there any way to end the sometimes deadly cycle of hatred [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=263.44s)]
*  and attacks on Jewish Americans in our country? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=270.64s)]
*  You know, I think it begins and ends with education. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=275.84s)]
*  There is a lot of ignorance. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=279.76s)]
*  People are not sure what exactly is a Jew. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=281.15999999999997s)]
*  And there is a lot of incitement on social media. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=284.4s)]
*  So I also hold the companies of social media responsible. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=287.47999999999996s)]
*  And there is also enforcing of law, because at the end of the day, when there is Jew hatred, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=291.91999999999996s)]
*  anti-Semitism, it doesn't just stop there. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=297.92s)]
*  It goes down to other minorities. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=301.36s)]
*  It goes to gay and lesbian communities and others as well. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=304.24s)]
*  So it's really about values and what we stand for. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=309.44s)]
*  I'm very happy that the U.S. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=313.52000000000004s)]
*  and Israel share the values, but I'm very concerned of the rising anti-Semitism in the U.S. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=315.08000000000004s)]
*  and also in other countries in the world where there is Jewish minorities as well. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=321.64s)]
*  And I do hope the authorities will take the relevant measures so this will minimize [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=326.32s)]
*  and eventually cease to be. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=331.84s)]
*  Avital Libovich, I have to leave it there. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=335.76s)]
*  Thank you very much for joining us. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=337.8s)]
*  Stay safe. Thank you. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N4Yr3sbJphw&t=339.44s)]
