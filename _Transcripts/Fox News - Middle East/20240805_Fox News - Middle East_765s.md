# Kayleigh McEnany: Does anyone have confidence right now?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po)
*  Well, we have a crisis developing right now in this country, not to mention the ones that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=0.0s)]
*  are all over the world right now. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=6.2s)]
*  War in Israel, potentially the Middle East now, they're on alert. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=9.0s)]
*  So all of this is developing on a very busy Monday and concerns over a potential recession [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=12.8s)]
*  now are causing stocks to plunge. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=18.02s)]
*  They've come back from where they were well over 1100 when stocks opened this morning, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=21.48s)]
*  but they're still in triple digit, really high triple digit number losses at this point. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=26.8s)]
*  The down down now by 809, 810 and we count on Japan's Nikkei index has its worst day [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=32.24s)]
*  since the Black Monday crash nearly 40 years ago. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=40.2s)]
*  So we are all globally connected and we tend to think that we are on top here in the United [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=45.0s)]
*  States because we are. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=50.18s)]
*  So when our world rocks, everybody's does. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=51.8s)]
*  The Middle East again is on the brink of a wider war. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  Israeli officials are bracing for a potential attack from Iran and it could happen, we're [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=57.36s)]
*  told, as early as today. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  So they're ahead of us in hours. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=62.919999999999995s)]
*  That means eminently because it's dark there now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=64.92s)]
*  President Biden will meet with his national security team in the situation room. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=68.6s)]
*  We're told that that will happen at 2 p.m. Eastern. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=72.52s)]
*  And the Pentagon says the United States is prepared for every possibility as Iran vows [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=75.12s)]
*  to, quote, punish Israel. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=80.08s)]
*  Our greatest ally in the Middle East. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=83.36s)]
*  We have many American citizens there that have dual citizenship with us here. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=85.56s)]
*  Israelis and American citizens, dual citizenship. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=91.56s)]
*  Some of them are fighting in the IDF right now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=93.96s)]
*  This is Outnumbered. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=96.96s)]
*  I'm Harris Faulkner here with my co-host, Kayleigh McEnany and Emily Campagno. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=98.16s)]
*  Also joining us today, Fox and Friends First, co-host Carly Shimkus and Fox News contributor [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=102.56s)]
*  and host of the Guy Benson show on Fox News Radio, Guy Benson. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=107.48s)]
*  Let's start with Alex Hogan, who was live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=111.72000000000001s)]
*  Israel is the latest on the ground there. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=114.68s)]
*  So imminent danger is what the alerts are coming across. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=116.56s)]
*  What's it like to be there, Alex? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=120.2s)]
*  Hi, Harris. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=122.2s)]
*  Well, the sun is setting. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=123.2s)]
*  It is another day of high tension here as people are bracing for what could be an Iranian [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=125.24000000000001s)]
*  attack, something that we have been repeatedly hearing the growing concerns, not just here [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=130.92000000000002s)]
*  on the ground, but internationally. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=135.32s)]
*  Today, Iran says that that retaliation will happen and it will be severe. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  But this is a look at the U.S. Navy's assets within the Middle East as the U.S. really [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=142.14s)]
*  tries to shore up its military might to support Israel's defense. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=147.94s)]
*  Now, diplomatically, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday spoke with G7 foreign [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=151.82s)]
*  ministers urging de-escalation. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=156.98s)]
*  This weekend, Israeli officials held defensive talks on the likely kinds of Iranian attacks [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=159.98s)]
*  that we could see play out. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=165.38000000000002s)]
*  And much of the preparing that we've seen is centered around Iran's attack in April [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=167.18s)]
*  when it launched about 300 drones and missiles toward Israel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=171.26000000000002s)]
*  All of that taking place within one night alone. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=175.02s)]
*  Iran today also sending this warning to Washington. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=177.98000000000002s)]
*  If the American government had acted on its moral, legal and human responsibility and [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=183.38000000000002s)]
*  put pressure on the Zionist regime, we would not have seen this level of instability in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=188.22000000000003s)]
*  the region. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=193.62s)]
*  Well, in Gaza today, Hamas militants fired about 15 rockets from the southern part of [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=196.3s)]
*  the strip into Israeli territory. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=201.38000000000002s)]
*  But it follows a weekend that was violent in the war that saw dozens of Palestinians [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=203.58s)]
*  killed in airstrikes, according to Hamas and the health ministry there, which warned that [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=207.70000000000002s)]
*  the death toll there has now surpassed 39,000 people killed in the last 10 months. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=212.02s)]
*  Now, looking to the northern part of Israel, back and forth crossfire today between the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=217.46s)]
*  IDF and Hezbollah, which we saw repeatedly take place just in the last several days. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=221.86s)]
*  The IAF says that it took out a Hezbollah weapon storage facility. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=227.62s)]
*  This is other countries are now sounding the alarm. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=231.46s)]
*  The World Health Organization today delivered 32 tons of medical supplies, including trauma [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=234.08s)]
*  kits to Lebanon for hospitals to stock up as tensions mount. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=240.38000000000002s)]
*  This comes as the U.S., France and the UK this weekend all called on their citizens [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=244.22000000000003s)]
*  in Lebanon to leave the country as soon as possible. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=249.02s)]
*  And if they are not leaving, they need to shelter in place. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=252.5s)]
*  Now, while that is taking place in Lebanon, Iran today is warning airlines not to fly [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=255.46s)]
*  over its airspace. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=261.3s)]
*  So incredibly high tensions here on the ground and throughout the region, as well as here [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=262.3s)]
*  taking place in Israel. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=267.54s)]
*  The country's defense minister spoke to forces today saying that they need to be prepared [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=268.7s)]
*  to defend the country and they need to be prepared to switch gears and to fire back [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=273.22s)]
*  offensively. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=278.02s)]
*  Harris. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=279.02s)]
*  Wow. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=280.02s)]
*  And meanwhile, there are about 100,000 people we've been reporting that have been displaced [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=281.02s)]
*  along the northern border with Lebanon, which we know that's Hezbollah as the proxy for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=285.21999999999997s)]
*  Iran. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=291.85999999999996s)]
*  So we could see a lot of movement along that border potentially, too. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=292.85999999999996s)]
*  Let's hope not. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=296.34s)]
*  All right, Alex, thank you very much. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=297.34s)]
*  I'm going to come to you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=299.34s)]
*  This is quite the moment. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=301.38s)]
*  Like I don't think we've ever faced a time in history where a candidate has pulled out [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=303.02s)]
*  of a race for the White House and now is going to negotiate our way forward in one [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=307.22s)]
*  of the most precarious times that we've seen in the Middle East. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=312.58000000000004s)]
*  The news cycle has been overwhelming for more than a month. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=316.62s)]
*  I think we're all feeling that. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=319.18s)]
*  I think voters are feeling that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=320.70000000000005s)]
*  I was struck listening to the soundbite that we played through the translator of an Iranian [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=322.70000000000005s)]
*  official attacking the Zionist entity, meaning Israel, for the instability in the region, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=326.34000000000003s)]
*  the gall of these liars. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  Instability in that region has a name. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=334.3s)]
*  It's Iran. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=336.38s)]
*  Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, they're the ones sowing this death and destruction. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=337.38s)]
*  And I think it's so telling over the course of the war in Gaza, which has been 100 percent [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=343.3s)]
*  justified by what happened on October 7th, the people, the usual suspects who always [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=347.34000000000003s)]
*  blame Israel and always attack the one Jewish state in the world, they've hidden behind [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=352.40000000000003s)]
*  various reasons for their supposed outrage, like civilian casualties and that sort of [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=357.22s)]
*  thing. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=361.54s)]
*  Well, in the last few weeks, what have we seen? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=362.54s)]
*  The Israelis executing pinpoint, precision, surgical strikes on top terrorists, and they're [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=364.26s)]
*  still mad at Israel. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=371.62s)]
*  And it's still Israel escalating. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=372.74s)]
*  No, Israel is responding by taking out terror masterminds, and the people who hate the Israelis [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=374.42s)]
*  are screaming bloody murder as usual. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=380.62s)]
*  Look, Americans have so much to deal with. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=382.82s)]
*  They're watching the markets move in a very negative way today, and from experts that [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=385.03999999999996s)]
*  I've been talking with, there's twofold. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=388.96s)]
*  It's the energy coming out of the Middle East, because countries are realizing now [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=391.06s)]
*  we can't get to those shipping lanes that we need. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=395.38s)]
*  I mean, that's already impacted our prices for oil. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=397.66s)]
*  But the other thing that we're watching now, too, outside of the energy, is just the price [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=400.26s)]
*  of everything is up. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=405.58s)]
*  Our ability to be resilient as a country economically in this moment is hitting. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=407.22s)]
*  That's playing a role on the stock markets, too. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=412.78s)]
*  So the world is watching us right now. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=414.58s)]
*  Where in the world are the people who are supposed to update us? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=418.02s)]
*  2015 is a long ways away when this started overnight. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=420.98s)]
*  That's the question. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=423.66s)]
*  We have a twofold crisis. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=424.66s)]
*  2.15 p.m. Eastern Time, they will be in the Situation Room. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=426.3s)]
*  Kamala Harris, Joe Biden. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=429.98s)]
*  Does anyone have confidence in the people who are going to be making decisions on these [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=432.18s)]
*  crises? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=435.98s)]
*  No, and I maintain you shouldn't. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=436.98s)]
*  On I believe it was January 12th of this year, Joe Biden was asked, April 12th, excuse me, [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=439.38s)]
*  what do you say to Iran as they consider waging war on Israel? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=444.94s)]
*  He said, don't. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=449.24s)]
*  Sometimes sometimes you need more than a syllable if you want to deter an adversary. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=451.02s)]
*  He said, don't. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=455.62s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=456.62s)]
*  Iran did the very next day. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=457.62s)]
*  Kamala Harris put out a tweet January 3rd, 2020, accusing Donald Trump of almost starting [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=459.06s)]
*  war because he took out Soleimani. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=464.38s)]
*  These are people who don't understand deterrence, don't understand effective communication. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=467.1s)]
*  Joe Biden last week, his word to Putin, stop, stop. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=471.78s)]
*  Don't. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=475.34s)]
*  People are not understanding that adversaries don't understand that you need more than a [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=476.34s)]
*  syllable. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=478.98s)]
*  And I don't trust those two minds coming together in this situation. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=479.98s)]
*  And I know you have toddlers in your household. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=481.94s)]
*  They don't even follow those words. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=483.62s)]
*  They don't. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=484.90000000000003s)]
*  I get it. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=485.90000000000003s)]
*  Emily. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  And keep in mind this weekend, too, when asked by reporters whether Iran would stand [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=488.90000000000003s)]
*  down, the president said, I hope so. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=492.82s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=495.1s)]
*  So in addition to the just the ineffective and the lame, you know, don't and not, he's [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=496.1s)]
*  literally saying, I'm not sure. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=502.58000000000004s)]
*  And this kind of feckless leadership, the kind of wishy washy that we are seeing as [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=504.44s)]
*  well from the vice president, who also this weekend we learned from Kirby has was part [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=507.5s)]
*  of authorizing force, you know, support over there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=511.62s)]
*  But flashback to 2020 when she was one of the large proponents of the no war against [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=514.78s)]
*  Iran bill. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=519.98s)]
*  She said at the time, we don't want Trump to take us unilaterally into war. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=520.98s)]
*  I will not support any type of funds over there. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=524.1s)]
*  So here we have one leader that isn't a leader and we have one leader that can't make up [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=526.6999999999999s)]
*  her mind. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=530.8199999999999s)]
*  And what did we learn last week with that historic prisoner swap? [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=531.8199999999999s)]
*  We learned the importance of allyship. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=534.72s)]
*  We learned the importance of these global relationships that we hope to rely on as Americans, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=536.78s)]
*  that our leaders will carry through. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=540.94s)]
*  What did we also learn from the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=543.1s)]
*  Can we count on these leaders to carry through? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=546.54s)]
*  Because right now in the Middle East, our allies there are aligned with parts of the [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=548.4s)]
*  Islamic Republic or parts of Iran that say we are not the Islamic Republic. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=552.82s)]
*  We want stability. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=557.22s)]
*  We want economic prosperity. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=558.3s)]
*  We do not like Hezbollah and all of these proxies cropping up. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=560.86s)]
*  We do not want that. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=564.4s)]
*  We want stability because we want to preserve our economic interests. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=565.4s)]
*  And to do so, we acknowledge the Jewish state sovereignty. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=568.52s)]
*  That's the majority. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=572.0799999999999s)]
*  The minority are these terrorists. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=573.24s)]
*  The minority are these anti-Semitic positions. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=575.3199999999999s)]
*  So when Prime Minister Netanyahu says, be prepared for a multi-front war, I hope our [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=577.64s)]
*  leaders take that into account because that includes the home front, the anti-Semitism [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=582.64s)]
*  and the support publicly and without any type of hindrance for Israel. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=587.36s)]
*  So what I love about that, it ties in what you were saying, Guy Benson, about how the [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=593.74s)]
*  Jewish state gets picked on. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=598.34s)]
*  So you're right. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=600.0600000000001s)]
*  The terrorists are outnumbered, but the people who are complicit in them retaining power [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=601.0600000000001s)]
*  in their bloodthirsty realm here, they outnumber everybody else because those people who support [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=606.0600000000001s)]
*  them are all over the Middle East. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=613.74s)]
*  I mean, we see this with Hamas and maybe people in Gaza are waking up to it now, but when [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=615.66s)]
*  you support killers, they'll put you in harm's way. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=621.0s)]
*  They'll kill you too. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=623.96s)]
*  I mean, that's where we are. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=624.96s)]
*  And with the Middle East in such a position, Carly, I just wonder, is anybody focused enough [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=626.92s)]
*  in the White House on what's going on with human pocketbooks inside the United States [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=632.2s)]
*  today, their ability, our ability as a nation to go forward? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=637.2s)]
*  Well, it's a great question. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=641.24s)]
*  And I was talking to somebody in Israel today and asked him if people there are on edge [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=642.52s)]
*  right now. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=646.2s)]
*  And he said yes and no. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=647.2s)]
*  And that answer makes so much sense considering there's the constant threat of attack. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=649.12s)]
*  But this 24 to 48 hour period is of heightened concern for obvious reasons. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=653.24s)]
*  One thing that could prove to be very important in this moment is that the foreign minister [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=658.92s)]
*  of Jordan was in Iran yesterday and the king of Jordan is speaking to President Biden today. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=663.32s)]
*  So there could be a communication channel still open if and how they choose to use it. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=669.14s)]
*  We may only learn after the fact. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=675.02s)]
*  To your point on communication, and if people are clear eyed in this moment, President Biden [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=678.9s)]
*  saying publicly that Benjamin Netanyahu needs to stop BSing when it comes to this negotiation. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=685.3s)]
*  First of all, the main driver of these hostage and ceasefire negotiations are Israel and [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=693.9399999999999s)]
*  Hamas is the one saying no. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=699.54s)]
*  And the other question is why is all of the public condemnation from the Biden-Harris [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=701.78s)]
*  side always against Israel? [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=707.54s)]
*  It's because it is foreign policy muddied by presidential politics when there does need [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=709.78s)]
*  to be a clear eyed approach to our number one ally in the Middle East. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=713.98s)]
*  And it's important to remember it's not just this moment. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=717.62s)]
*  It is their politics. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=720.36s)]
*  It's every moment that they've been engaged in. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=722.1999999999999s)]
*  So when Biden meets with leaders in the Situation Room today, he's promised Kamala she'll be [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=724.06s)]
*  the last one in the room. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=729.98s)]
*  I'll be curious to see if she at the table at this point for these important foreign [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=731.54s)]
*  policy decisions. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=735.58s)]
*  They own it anyway. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=738.1800000000001s)]
*  And to remind her today is Ariel Bebas' fifth birthday. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=740.0200000000001s)]
*  You know, there are still hundreds of hostages being kept. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=743.86s)]
*  Where are they? [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=746.4200000000001s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=747.4200000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=748.4200000000001s)]
*  Hey everyone, I'm Emily Campagno. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HcQ0E8fl7po&t=749.4200000000001s)]
