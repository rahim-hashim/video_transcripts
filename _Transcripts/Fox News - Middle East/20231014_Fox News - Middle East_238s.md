# Hypocrisy, lack of moral compass on campuses is anti-Semitism: CEO
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk)
*  All right, this one got a little weird. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=0.0s)]
*  I don't know if you followed up the people like Bill Ackman, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=5.28s)]
*  the billionaire who was calling out Harvard students for blaming Israel for [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=8.36s)]
*  these Hamas attacks, calling on CEOs not to hire any one of them. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=12.82s)]
*  My next CEO was among those who agreed, David Duell is the easy health CEO. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=16.56s)]
*  So he advocated just that and curiously enough, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=21.2s)]
*  his LinkedIn account was blocked, remains blocked. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  He joins us right now. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=28.0s)]
*  David, that seems a little more than coincidental, but what do you make of that? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=29.68s)]
*  Thank you, Neil, for having me today. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  I'd like to share some context. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=39.12s)]
*  I think that that'd be helpful to frame the situation. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=41.24s)]
*  My family fled their homeland of Iran over 2,000 years [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=43.92s)]
*  of the Islamic Revolution in 1979. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=48.04s)]
*  The Persian Jewish community had to flee overnight, a once unimaginable situation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=51.2s)]
*  And as a result of my family's experience, I don't take my freedoms and [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=56.199999999999996s)]
*  securities for granted. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  I'm a student of history and anti-Semitism, and [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=61.44s)]
*  I'm aware of how tenuous our safety is in society. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=63.72s)]
*  Our campuses are supposedly bastions of free speech, but [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=67.72s)]
*  are truly domains of preferred speech at best. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=72.28s)]
*  I think you and I know very well that in the wake of George Floyd, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=75.28s)]
*  if white nationalists decided to hold a rally at UCLA or Harvard, [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=78.92s)]
*  it would never be allowed. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=83.28s)]
*  Yet these same elite institutions are allowing and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=85.26s)]
*  often encouraging calls of protest for the slaughter and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=88.18s)]
*  genocide of the Jewish people. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=90.82000000000001s)]
*  Chanting River to the Sea, Palestine will be free. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=92.5s)]
*  These are the same people who so vocally demanded safe spaces for [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=95.98s)]
*  everyone and misgendering to be deemed a human rights violation. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=99.58000000000001s)]
*  So I'm not surprised my account was taken down for [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=103.54s)]
*  sharing a list of students who were advocating for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=106.22s)]
*  the definite destruction of the Jewish people. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=109.18s)]
*  We're not talking about arguments over a two state solution or [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=111.7s)]
*  political divisions of land. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=114.9s)]
*  We're talking about Hamas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=116.7s)]
*  We're talking about terrorism, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=118.26s)]
*  whose own charter calls for the extermination of the Jews. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=119.78s)]
*  So I think the hypocrisy and lack of moral clarity on campuses and [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  with administration is conscious or subconscious anti-Semitism. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=127.54s)]
*  And we need to make sure these students pay a price and that their neighbors, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=132.66s)]
*  friends, and employers know that they harbor these beliefs. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=136.5s)]
*  So you're saying for what they did as college kids, and [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=140.06s)]
*  you're quite right, a lot of it have very strong reactions to it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=144.5s)]
*  Unless they reverse those views or you would never hire any one of them. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=149.62s)]
*  I think nobody should be judged by the worst decision they made at their life. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=158.14000000000001s)]
*  I've made a lot of stupid decisions in my life. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=162.74s)]
*  But I think they have an opportunity to publicly renounce their support for [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=165.14000000000001s)]
*  terrorism and Jew hatred. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=168.82s)]
*  And this is not about my personal not hiring of folks cuz I'm a small impact. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=170.82s)]
*  But ultimately about the broader community knowing who these people are. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=176.42s)]
*  And for all employers, neighbors, and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=181.7s)]
*  friends to know that these folks harbor these types of beliefs. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=183.54s)]
*  At the end of the 20th century, 40% of university faculty and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=187.26s)]
*  students in Vienna were Jews. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=191.74s)]
*  That number went to zero and they got killed in the Holocaust. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=194.54s)]
*  I'm going to do my part to prevent this from happening again. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=198.1s)]
*  And I felt the need to speak up knowing full well that this would come at a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=201.02s)]
*  financial and personal price. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=204.06s)]
*  I've already received multiple threats bombarded with hate messages. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=206.06s)]
*  But history has shown that the price of inaction could be greater. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=210.22s)]
*  All right, well we have reached out to LinkedIn to find out what happened here. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=214.26s)]
*  We've not heard back, but we do want to keep track of this and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=217.7s)]
*  maybe get you back to find out how that's going. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=220.3s)]
*  But David, thank you for taking the time. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=222.5s)]
*  Thank you so much, Neil. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=POsRFn1zpBk&t=225.54s)]
