# General Keane on US-Iran tensions amid airstrike fallout
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks)
*  General Jack Keene is also with us this evening, chairman of the institute for the study of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=0.0s)]
*  war and Fox News senior strategic analyst. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=4.24s)]
*  General, good to see you this evening. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=7.28s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=9.44s)]
*  You know, I want to start with this. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  This is a sound bite from the former CIA director, Mike Morell. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=13.8s)]
*  Here's what he said about what we can all expect now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Watch. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=21.080000000000002s)]
*  The problem is that comes at a very high cost. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  Number one, there will be dead Americans, dead civilian Americans as a result of this, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=26.8s)]
*  possibly over the next few days in any place where Iran has its proxies. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=32.8s)]
*  Iraq is the most likely place, but also Lebanon, Bahrain, other places in the Middle East. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=39.04s)]
*  General, do you agree with that? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=45.0s)]
*  Well, I think the Iranians are going to retaliate. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=47.36s)]
*  That's for sure. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=50.08s)]
*  I mean, they as much stated it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=51.08s)]
*  What's going on with the Iranians so our viewers can understand? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=53.24s)]
*  Civil unrest driven by the sanctions has really got the Iranians back on their heels. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=56.3s)]
*  It spiked in November and there is nothing more threatening to their regime than their [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=62.019999999999996s)]
*  own people. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=66.94s)]
*  And that's that's what has got their concern. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=68.36s)]
*  And they they're determined to create as much crisis as they can for the international community [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=70.86s)]
*  to put pressure on President Trump to back off the sanctions. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=77.42s)]
*  And that is why, as you mentioned in the introduction with a former previous guest, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=81.04s)]
*  why they have been escalating military actions to create that crisis, to pressure the president. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=86.14s)]
*  But the problem is they crossed the red line with this president when he when he exercised [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  enormous constraint in not taking a provocation, but said, don't kill any Americans. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=99.68s)]
*  And when they did, he he acted and acted very strongly as we've seen. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=106.36000000000001s)]
*  You know, the suggestion that there's no strategy is one that you hear a lot. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=110.94s)]
*  We started hearing it last night and all through today. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=114.5s)]
*  But it strikes me that it was obvious that in the prior administration, the strategy [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=117.8s)]
*  was to to negotiate, to deal and to try to create an environment that deescalated through [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=121.74000000000001s)]
*  that avenue. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=128.12s)]
*  But clearly this president has a different way of going about it. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=130.2s)]
*  And as I said at the top, he is the first one to take out Soleimani, which is something [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=134.14s)]
*  that was probably opportunities that these other presidents, President Obama, President [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=139.58s)]
*  Bush had, I would imagine. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=143.64000000000001s)]
*  It is a definite strategy here. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=145.96s)]
*  This Trump administration looked at the appeasement strategy, as I would define it, that President [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=148.54000000000002s)]
*  Obama exercised for eight years as a seminal foreign policy objective. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=153.14000000000001s)]
*  It was his Nixon moment going to China, so to speak, is what he was trying to achieve. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=157.34s)]
*  And he thought by appeasing the Iranians, a nuclear deal with the centerpiece of it, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=162.54000000000002s)]
*  they would act responsibly and join the community of responsible nations. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=167.66000000000003s)]
*  And what did we get? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=171.92000000000002s)]
*  We got $130 billion put in their hands fueling the civil wars in Syria and Yemen, hundreds [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=173.22s)]
*  of thousands of rockets in Lebanon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=179.38000000000002s)]
*  The Middle East was put on fire as a result of it. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  This administration came in and fundamentally rejected that strategy and with our allies [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  definitely has a strategy. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=191.42000000000002s)]
*  It's to confront the Iranians using diplomatic and economic means to bring them back to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=193.42s)]
*  the negotiating table, not just to stop nuclear weapons and missiles but to curb their behavior [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=198.22s)]
*  in the region. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=203.7s)]
*  That is a sound strategy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=204.7s)]
*  And that's what this administration is about. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=206.98s)]
*  And to say they don't have one is nonsense. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=208.62s)]
*  We're going to have to leave it there. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=211.14s)]
*  We know that our military is on alert in Italy for the possibility of potentially going in [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=214.14s)]
*  to protect our assets and embassies in Lebanon. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=220.16000000000003s)]
*  And as you say, retaliation is likely. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=224.08s)]
*  And we'll be watching. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=227.0s)]
*  They're going to go in there in the event there has to be an evacuation and pressure [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=228.0s)]
*  is put. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=232.32000000000002s)]
*  173rd would go to Lebanon, evacuate the embassy, and the 82nd would go to Baghdad to evacuate [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=233.32000000000002s)]
*  the embassy. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=238.88000000000002s)]
*  That's primarily what they're there for. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=239.88000000000002s)]
*  General Keene, we'll be talking to you today in the coming days. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=241.52s)]
*  Thank you so much, sir. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vN4Jrrcl-ks&t=245.20000000000002s)]
