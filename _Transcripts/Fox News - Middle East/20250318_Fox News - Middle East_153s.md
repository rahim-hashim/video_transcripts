# BREAKING: Israel takes out Hamas' head of government
**Fox News - Middle East:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0)
*  Alright, John, we've got this Fox News alert of Mideast ceasefire breaking down as Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=0.0s)]
*  opens fire on Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip, announcing it took out several Hamas terrorists, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=4.16s)]
*  including the head of the Hamas government. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=10.52s)]
*  Let's get right to Trey Yankstar, our chief foreign correspondent. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=12.84s)]
*  He's live from Tel Aviv for us at this hour. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=15.24s)]
*  What is the situation there tonight, Trey? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=17.64s)]
*  Yes, Andrew, good afternoon. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=20.64s)]
*  We do have some breaking news for you right now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=22.72s)]
*  Minutes ago, sirens were sounding across southern Israel as the Iran-backed Houthis [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=25.0s)]
*  in Yemen launched a ballistic missile toward this country. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=30.04s)]
*  We are told by the Israeli military the missile was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=33.64s)]
*  but as a precaution due to the shrapnel from this interception, nearly a quarter million [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=40.4s)]
*  people were sent to bomb shelters in cities like Be'er Sheva and Damona in the southern [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=45.16s)]
*  part of this country in the Negev desert. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=50.24s)]
*  This is the first launch from Yemen toward Israel since the ceasefire broke down, and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=52.9s)]
*  it comes amid the backdrop of renewed conflict inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=58.62s)]
*  Overnight, Israeli forces bombarding the entirety of the enclave in Gaza, targeting Gaza City, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=63.019999999999996s)]
*  Hanunis and Ra'afa, reportedly killing hundreds of people. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=69.46s)]
*  Fox News cannot independently confirm that number, but we do know that a number of mid-level [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=73.25999999999999s)]
*  were killed in those strikes and the top spokesman for Palestinian Islamic Jihad. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=79.96s)]
*  Now later this evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is expected to address [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=85.63999999999999s)]
*  the nation about the ongoing war against Hamas inside Gaza. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=90.32s)]
*  But remember, there is close coordination taking place right now between the Israelis [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  and the Americans, not only as it relates to fighting inside the Gaza Strip, but also [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Iranian proxies, including the Houthis, following those American strikes over the weekend that [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=105.34s)]
*  targeted not only weapon storage facilities, but also a number of headquarters and launching [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=110.58s)]
*  positions for the Houthis. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=116.06s)]
*  So again, the latest information that we have tonight, Sandra, sirens just minutes ago sounding [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=118.02000000000001s)]
*  across southern Israel as a ballistic missile was intercepted outside of Israeli airspace [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  fired by the Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=129.26s)]
*  Sandra? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=132.22s)]
*  Thank you, Trey Yanks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=133.22s)]
*  They're live in Tel Aviv for us with the latest. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUhV1njVyH0&t=134.22s)]
