# 'DEATH BY 1000 CUTS': Iran scholar breaks down regime's strategy following attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI)
*  A Fox News alert, the world's leading terror sponsor launching its first direct military [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=0.0s)]
*  assault against Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=5.38s)]
*  Iran's Revolutionary Guard retaliating after two of its officials, one of them being its [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  top official, were killed in a strike at a consulate in Syria earlier this month. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=11.82s)]
*  Here to break down the terror regime's goal of reshaping the Middle East and the world [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=17.34s)]
*  as we know it, Iran's scholar and author, Benham Ben Talebou. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=20.84s)]
*  Benham, thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=26.0s)]
*  What is their goal? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=28.060000000000002s)]
*  Do they think they advanced the ball down the field last night? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=29.200000000000003s)]
*  Pleasure to be with you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=32.7s)]
*  In essence, I think the regime is trying to enact a death by a thousand cut strategy against [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=34.6s)]
*  Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=39.480000000000004s)]
*  We know that for 45 years it's had enmity, ideological and strategic with the Jewish [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  state. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=44.660000000000004s)]
*  And when it says death to Israel, it means it. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=45.66s)]
*  When it says death to America, it means it. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=47.52s)]
*  But unlike other actors, this regime knows how to fight to live another day. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=49.64s)]
*  So I think last night was just the beginning of a change that we're seeing in the security [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=53.96s)]
*  posture of the world's foremost state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=58.06s)]
*  Expect more, not less public operation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=61.36s)]
*  So that's interesting because you could have a debate about whether or not the Iranian [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=63.580000000000005s)]
*  leadership and regime is a rational actor. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=66.48s)]
*  You're sort of saying they're both, that they have this ideological bent, but they're not [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  suicidal. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=74.32000000000001s)]
*  So they want death to Israel, but they're going to inform the world that they're going [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=75.38s)]
*  to attack because it serves their purposes for now in pursuit of a larger goal. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=81.06s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=85.98s)]
*  The word for this is means ends rational. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=86.98s)]
*  They may have irrational ends, but they can logically and rationally follow those ends [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=89.98s)]
*  using the limited means they have. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=95.22s)]
*  And just look at what they struck Israel with last night, cheap, low and slow flying drones [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=97.18s)]
*  and more expensive high and fast flying ballistic missiles. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=102.14s)]
*  Both of these are replacements for the fact that the Islamic Republic of Iran has an exceptionally [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=105.7s)]
*  outdated air force. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=110.66s)]
*  These are weapons of the weak, but the Islamic Republic has become home to the largest ballistic [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=111.92s)]
*  missile arsenal in the Middle East. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=116.67999999999999s)]
*  And it's been turning that into its advantage. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=118.08s)]
*  So if they would, do they have weapons capable of surpassing these missile defense systems [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  and they intentionally did not use them? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=126.6s)]
*  I think you have a lot more of the same. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=129.28s)]
*  So sometimes they say quantity has a quality of its own. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=131.35999999999999s)]
*  There were reportedly only two to 300 cruise missiles, ballistic missiles and drones employed [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=135.04s)]
*  last night. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=139.56s)]
*  Tehran could employ probably hundreds more, marry them up with even cheaper drones, for [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=140.56s)]
*  example. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=145.68s)]
*  The Islamic Republic has a lot more lethality, mobility, survivability behind its ballistic [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=146.68s)]
*  missiles. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=152.0s)]
*  I fear that this is just the tip of the iceberg. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=153.0s)]
*  So you say death by a thousand cuts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=154.84s)]
*  That might be their strategy in pursuit of that goal. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=156.6s)]
*  Then what what did future cuts look like? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=159.84s)]
*  Why would you anticipate Iran continues to try to get at the state of Israel in the United [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=162.16s)]
*  States? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=166.72s)]
*  Well, first, it has a diplomatic strategy to stop the normalization between Saudi Arabia [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=167.72s)]
*  and Israel at all cost. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=172.24s)]
*  Second, it wants to pick off U.S. regional partners like the UAE, like some of the Gulf [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=173.92s)]
*  Cooperation Council states, get them to hedge a bit more. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=178.04s)]
*  Third, it wants to integrate China and Russia much more into the security architecture of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=181.44s)]
*  the region. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=186.0s)]
*  Those are Iran's lawyers after all. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=187.0s)]
*  And fourth, it wants to continue to animate a boom and bust cycle of violence against [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=188.88s)]
*  Israel from wherever it comes, from the Gaza Strip, from Lebanon, from Syria, and to force [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=192.92s)]
*  Israel to essentially be eradicated. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=197.83999999999997s)]
*  And that's why they've encircled Israel with a ring of fire of Iran-backed weaponry, drones, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=199.96s)]
*  missiles, rockets, you name it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=204.8s)]
*  Real quick, Benham, do you anticipate a retaliation from Israel and how large? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=207.16s)]
*  I certainly do, even though there are some troubling signs that the Biden administration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=213.44s)]
*  may be backing away already or trying to put handcuffs on Israel. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=216.92000000000002s)]
*  I think especially after a post-October 7 Middle East, it would be impossible to think [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=220.24s)]
*  of a world where the Israelis would not. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=224.72s)]
*  I don't necessarily think they're going to go for nuclear facilities, but I do think [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=226.68s)]
*  they're going to try to engage in deterrence by punishment. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  Benham, thank you for your time. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=232.4s)]
*  An Iran scholar from FDD, thank you for being here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=234.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LF5WT07BuGI&t=236.72s)]
