# Iran is the one that's waged the 'forever war,' GOP senator charges
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw)
*  Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=0.0s)]
*  Senator, they took out a hospital, for crying out loud. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=2.56s)]
*  The Israelis, they have been going after military targets. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=6.68s)]
*  But if you go back years, the Israelis have had to withstand what is over hundreds of [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=10.0s)]
*  thousands of missiles, mostly provided by Iran, either fired directly by them or through [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=15.88s)]
*  the proxies that they use. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=21.580000000000002s)]
*  They have been at war with Israel for all this time. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=24.14s)]
*  Now those missiles are more lethal than ever. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=27.2s)]
*  And now they're on the verge. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=29.759999999999998s)]
*  It's two minutes to midnight, a minute to midnight of getting nuclear weapons. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=31.439999999999998s)]
*  That can't happen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=34.839999999999996s)]
*  The president's been clear. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  I'm not exactly sure what a peace deal would look like, but I think the conditions I laid [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=37.2s)]
*  out are the only ones that would actually work. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=41.5s)]
*  What are your thoughts? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=44.04s)]
*  Sean, I agree with the details of a potential agreement that you laid out. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=47.04s)]
*  Color me skeptical that the Ayatollahs would accept such a term. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=51.879999999999995s)]
*  They've refused it for decades. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=54.92s)]
*  But as you say, Iran is the one that's waged the forever war. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=57.68s)]
*  They've waged a forever war against the United States and Israel and the civilized world [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=61.84s)]
*  since 1979. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=66.16s)]
*  And for 25 years, American presidents have been pledging that Iran cannot get a nuclear [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=68.24s)]
*  weapon. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  But only one, Donald Trump, actually has done something about it and has said that we're [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=74.03999999999999s)]
*  going to bring this chapter to a close soon. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=79.12s)]
*  As you put it, Fordow, their deeply buried underground nuclear bunker, has to be closed, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=82.44s)]
*  one way or the other. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=88.64s)]
*  It can be closed the easy way or it can be closed the hard way. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=89.64s)]
*  But it has to be immediately. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=90.64s)]
*  If they can't use this to buy time to rebuild their arsenal or to go deeper into their nuclear [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=93.24s)]
*  program, to me, it would almost have to be next day or nextâ€”within two days, no more [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=101.75999999999999s)]
*  Americans on the ground in the Fordow facility beginning the process of scientifically figuring [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=108.92s)]
*  out how to dismantle it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=115.56s)]
*  But it would also include anywhere, anyplace, any time inspections. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=117.22s)]
*  And they have to give up their long-range missiles and, frankly, any missile that has [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=120.76s)]
*  a range to hit any American target in the region. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=124.44s)]
*  I think that would be a fair deal considering they have no leverage and their backs against [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=127.28s)]
*  the wall because the Israelis have kicked their ass. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=131.68s)]
*  Yeah, and Sean, I don't think the president is going to allow the Ayatollahs to tap him [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=135.04s)]
*  along the way so many other presidents have. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=139.76s)]
*  This is a chance to bring this chapter to a close. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=142.56s)]
*  History will look back kindly on Donald Trump for ending this menace to the United States, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=146.28s)]
*  to our friends in the region, to the civilized world. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=151.12s)]
*  And as you said, he's going to make a decision within two weeks, could be two days, could [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=153.94s)]
*  be two hours. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=157.68s)]
*  The Ayatollahs need to act fast if they want to avoid the worst possible fate at Fordow. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  It's going to be closed one way or the other. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=165.88s)]
*  What do you make of China sending these mystery transport planes into Iran? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=169.72s)]
*  That concerns me. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=173.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, China has been buying Iran's oil on the black market for years, propping up their [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=175.92000000000002s)]
*  economy. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=181.88s)]
*  We shouldn't be surprised that China is going to continue to provide some kinds of support [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=182.88s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=186.88s)]
*  What we're going to see is Iran being isolated. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=188.07999999999998s)]
*  China has not let to Iran's offense. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=190.32s)]
*  Russia has basically said Iran is on its own. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=192.04s)]
*  None of their so-called proxies, their ring of fire around Israel has any desire left [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=194.84s)]
*  to fight Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=200.32s)]
*  In some places where they once had footholds like in Syria, Israel now has complete freedom [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=201.32s)]
*  of action against Iran. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=207.28s)]
*  So I think the real story here is that Iran is totally isolated. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=208.8s)]
*  Netanyahu has put the Ayatollahs on the back foot and we're about to finally bring this [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=214.8s)]
*  threat to the United States to an end. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=219.76s)]
*  Let's bring a little politics into this. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=223.24s)]
*  I mean, the left has been tolerant in the halls of Congress, on college campuses, of [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=225.08s)]
*  virulent anti-Semitism, and in many ways they have been somewhat complicit. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=229.96s)]
*  Their silence has been deafening. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=236.04s)]
*  I find in this conflict as well, their silence has been somewhat deafening. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=238.8s)]
*  Why are there not more outspoken voices against the number one state sponsor of terror? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=244.0s)]
*  To me, this is an issue of simple moral clarity, especially based on their history of following [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=248.16s)]
*  through and firing weapons either directly or through their proxies and also targeting [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=254.16s)]
*  Americans over the years going back to 1979. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=260.12s)]
*  There's your forever war. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=263.0s)]
*  They started it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=264.0s)]
*  Well, yeah, Sean, if you look at, for instance, some of these protests that have broken out [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=265.88s)]
*  on campus over the last two years, they don't just wave the Palestinian flag and burn the [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=270.56s)]
*  Israeli flag. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=275.08s)]
*  They burn the American flag. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=276.08s)]
*  They don't just chant against Israel. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=277.48s)]
*  They condemn the United States itself, which has provided them so many blessings of liberty. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=280.18s)]
*  The same thing is true in Iran. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=285.84s)]
*  They call Israel the little Satan. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=288.2s)]
*  They call the United States the great Satan. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=289.52s)]
*  They chant death to Israel. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=291.92s)]
*  They also chant death to America because they realize that we're part of the same heritage [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=292.92s)]
*  of Western civilization that they want to overthrow. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=298.56s)]
*  That's what the radical left in America wants to as well. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=301.88s)]
*  It's really two sides of the same coin. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=305.26s)]
*  Are there any things that you might be aware of? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  Because this kind of caught a lot of people by surprise that the president was opening [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=312.6s)]
*  door a little bit to maybe giving them a little bit more time after the 60 days and Israel [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=317.96000000000004s)]
*  very quickly bringing them to their knees. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=324.08s)]
*  Is there any insight? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=326.88s)]
*  Is there any other information that maybe the public's not thinking about that the president [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=328.16s)]
*  would know of that would cause him to buy a little more time? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=332.88s)]
*  Because I suspect that's a possibility. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=338.24s)]
*  Yeah, Sean, I don't want to speculate about what the president is thinking or about any [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=341.76s)]
*  information that we may have. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=347.68s)]
*  It's not in the public domain. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=349.12s)]
*  But I think it is clear after a week of Israel pummeling Iran's defenses that we do have [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=350.84s)]
*  the benefit of time here. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=356.8s)]
*  Not months, not years, but hours, days, a couple of weeks, as the president decided [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=358.52s)]
*  today. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=362.8s)]
*  He may give the Ayatollahs one last chance to try to turn over all of their nuclear weapons [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=364.08s)]
*  program uranium enrichment. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=368.15999999999997s)]
*  So to make sure that we're prepared in the region and around the world, as you rightly [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=370.26000000000005s)]
*  said, Sean, this is not without risk. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=374.42s)]
*  Our troops in the region are at risk. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  We have embassies around the world. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=378.78000000000003s)]
*  For all we know, sleeper cells could be in America because of Joe Biden's wide open border. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=380.14000000000004s)]
*  The president is aware of all of those threats. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=384.22s)]
*  I think we already know they are. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=386.5s)]
*  He wants to be prepared for them. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=387.5s)]
*  That's not an issue in dispute, is it? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=390.02000000000004s)]
*  He's let in known terrorists. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=391.66s)]
*  We know they're here. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=393.22s)]
*  Yeah, and I think, yeah, and Sean, I think the president recognizes all of those risks [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=394.5s)]
*  and those dangers, but he understands, as he's understood for 10 years, that the danger [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=399.54s)]
*  of a nuclear Iran with ballistic missiles within a few years that could hit the United [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=404.42s)]
*  States makes all those things worth bearing for the sake of the safety of the American [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=408.74s)]
*  people. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=415.1s)]
*  All right, Senator Tom Cotton, we appreciate you being with us as always. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFwlr-Ur3Sw&t=416.1s)]
