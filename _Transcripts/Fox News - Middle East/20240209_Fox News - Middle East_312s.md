# Israel should not take Biden’s advice: Gen. Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc)
*  President Biden publicly questioning Israel's military conduct in Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm of the view, as you know, that the conduct of the response in Gaza, in the Gaza Strip [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=7.76s)]
*  has been over the top. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=22.04s)]
*  He's saying that publicly. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=26.08s)]
*  Biden's comments coming as his administration is negotiating for the release of more hostages. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=27.799999999999997s)]
*  Here to react, Fox News Senior Strategic Analyst, retired four-star General Jack Geene. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=31.52s)]
*  General, the significance of the president saying that yesterday, and is he right? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=35.839999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, this is really unfortunate, but at least it's in the public what's been [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=41.44s)]
*  going on for weeks. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=47.68s)]
*  The administration has put a fair amount of pressure on the prime minister and the IDF [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=49.56s)]
*  forces. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=54.76s)]
*  And they've changed the nature of their operations. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=56.44s)]
*  On the one hand, reduced the comprehensive bombing campaign. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=57.44s)]
*  That has been reduced. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=62.72s)]
*  Number two, the change in nature of the ground operations and stop the clearing operations, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=65.08s)]
*  which is building by building, street by street, tunnel by tunnel, and conduct limited raids [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=71.2s)]
*  and also focus on leaders. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=78.52s)]
*  The IDF looks at that quite accurately in my view and says, well, that protracts the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=82.28s)]
*  war rather dramatically because we're not going to systematically dismantle Hamas as [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=87.34s)]
*  a result of it, as a fighting force. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=93.82s)]
*  And I know for a fact that when we focused on leaders in Iraq for three years, while [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=97.78s)]
*  we killed a lot of leaders, we were at the same time losing the war on the ground because [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=102.34s)]
*  our strategy wasn't right. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=107.42s)]
*  It would really be inappropriate for the IDF to take that advice and start following it, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=110.14s)]
*  and it will not lead to their end state, which is really to dramatically reduce Hamas, dismantle [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=116.38s)]
*  it and prevent it from ever attacking again. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=123.62s)]
*  If we put in play the strategy that the United States is suggesting, what will happen is [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=127.22s)]
*  Hamas leadership will survive, a fair amount of their fighting force will survive, and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=133.3s)]
*  what will happen? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=139.74s)]
*  They will rearm, rebuild, and re-attack. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=141.02s)]
*  And that's absolute failure for the Israelis because then they're not what? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=143.82000000000002s)]
*  They're not protecting their people. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=148.34s)]
*  And that's what's driving the leadership of Israel. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=150.3s)]
*  And I think we should support them and get out of the way. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  I 100 percent agree. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=158.14s)]
*  Evidently, the prime minister gave the secretary of state a virtual slap in the face when they [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=159.14s)]
*  were together a couple of days ago because I think he suggested the same thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=165.34s)]
*  There's been a change of leadership in Ukraine. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=168.5s)]
*  Zelensky has fired his former chief of the military. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=171.5s)]
*  He's hired a guy named General Zersky, who's nicknamed the butcher. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=175.5s)]
*  Is this a good move? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=180.57999999999998s)]
*  Well, that's up to the Ukrainians to decide here. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=183.14000000000001s)]
*  I mean, Zelensky is very popular, Brian. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=188.70000000000002s)]
*  He's a change agent. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=193.98000000000002s)]
*  He tried to change the Soviet doctrine of the focus on centralization and decentralize [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=194.98000000000002s)]
*  his force. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=201.9s)]
*  You saw that in the accomplishments that they've had in doing that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=203.18s)]
*  He's earned a huge amount of respect, so much so that many people in Ukraine want him to [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=208.14s)]
*  replace Zelensky as president. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=214.46s)]
*  So that's a tension point right there. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=216.54s)]
*  The second tension point for President Zelensky was, of course, the counteroffensive did not [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=218.9s)]
*  succeed and Zalusny described it as a stalemate in an interview and that infuriated the president. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=223.9s)]
*  Also, the new defense secretary, defense minister, excuse me, who I've spoken to a couple of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=233.06s)]
*  times, I know full well that he has had issues also with Zalusny and his popularity and his [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=238.62s)]
*  obstinance at times. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=245.58s)]
*  This is a decision for them to make. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=247.46s)]
*  Obviously, Zersky is very qualified. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=249.46s)]
*  They're in war. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=253.26000000000002s)]
*  Not everything is going the way they want to. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=254.26000000000002s)]
*  They want to make a change. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=255.70000000000002s)]
*  Let them make that change. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=257.3s)]
*  It's complicated because of the issues I mentioned. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=260.1s)]
*  And we just got to get them the aid and hopefully they're going to get that through. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=263.78000000000003s)]
*  Mike Pompeo and Mike Pence wrote in an editorial and they seem to be singing your song, General. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=267.1s)]
*  They're talking about it's time to strike back at Iran directly. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=271.26s)]
*  You feel the same way. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=275.82s)]
*  Oh yeah, this is long overdue. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=277.62s)]
*  The center of gravity for all the proxy activity that is going on in the Middle East is Iran. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=280.86s)]
*  The longer we ignore that, the longer it goes on. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=287.9s)]
*  It is that simple, Brian. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=291.29999999999995s)]
*  I hear you. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=293.29999999999995s)]
*  General Jack Keane, thanks so much. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=294.29999999999995s)]
*  The world is a crazy place. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=295.62s)]
*  You have a great way of navigating us through it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=297.94s)]
*  Thanks so much, General. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tZPdayz7MMc&t=300.9s)]
