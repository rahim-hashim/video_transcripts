# Sleeper cell concerns: More Iranians with criminal histories arrested by ICE
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo)
*  So with that, we bring in Florida Congressman and House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=0.0s)]
*  Brian Maass, also served in the U.S. Army for more than 12 years, was a bomb disposal [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  expert while deployed in Afghanistan. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=8.98s)]
*  Congressman, thank you very much for joining us today. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=11.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=14.8s)]
*  So give me a reaction to this report of these several Iranians who've already been arrested [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=15.8s)]
*  in the country. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=22.16s)]
*  And given the fact that we know that so many people crossed the border, some of whom were [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=23.52s)]
*  on the terror watch list over the past few years. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=27.5s)]
*  Yeah, let me give you two specific ties on why this matters. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=29.740000000000002s)]
*  Number one, there's the previous policies of the Biden administration. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=33.58s)]
*  That's why they were here, because they had policies that let people in illegally or just [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  simply were content to allow people to remain here illegally. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=41.74s)]
*  And that's what got rolled up, including, as you mentioned in your report, individuals [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=45.22s)]
*  that were literally known and suspected terrorists. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=48.900000000000006s)]
*  Here's the future tie that really matters. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=51.7s)]
*  You have the new Democrat policies as it relates to border and immigration, which are don't [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=53.84s)]
*  work with ICE, go out there and make sure to fund even more sanctuary cities, don't deport [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=59.2s)]
*  terrorists, make sure you bring them back if you did deport them. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=65.04s)]
*  And oh, by the way, don't deport gang members either if there happen to be gang members [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=68.44s)]
*  here and ask gang members in L.A. to turn their guns on ICE instead. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=72.62s)]
*  There's a new Democratic Party policies that are coming forward on what to do with these [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=77.2s)]
*  illegal immigrants from Iran or from South America or anywhere else. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=81.4s)]
*  And the other quick point that I would put on this as well is just simply to say for [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=85.92s)]
*  these individuals that are here legally, you talked about the gotaways in that report. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=90.28s)]
*  Why gotaways matter so much is because there were policies for the last four years that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=94.16000000000001s)]
*  incentivized coming into America illegally. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=98.72s)]
*  Who do you have to be coming into America if you ran away from those incentives that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=101.80000000000001s)]
*  you could have just been handed and said, I don't want anybody to know I'm here? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=106.92s)]
*  Great point. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=110.52s)]
*  It's a great point, Congressman. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=111.52s)]
*  So some members of Congress were waiting for some testimony from the defense secretary [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=112.52s)]
*  and others with regard to the operation that we watched, Operation Midnight Hammer, the [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=118.6s)]
*  strike in Iran. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=123.8s)]
*  Here's Adam Schiff talking about that and about what you and I have been discussing [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=125.12s)]
*  watch. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=129.64s)]
*  Today they mentioned the possibility of sleeper cells or attacks within the United States. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=130.64s)]
*  We need greater visibility into the status of our homeland security. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=137.78s)]
*  And this is not something that ought to wait for the appearance of defensive secretary [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=143.46s)]
*  Higzaf. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=148.38s)]
*  So he's saying the sleeper cells are so important that he didn't want this postponed to wait [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=149.38s)]
*  for the defense secretary to return from NATO. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=153.26s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=156.86s)]
*  Look, this is a real threat, right? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=157.86s)]
*  Just as much as Israelis had operatives in Iran, just as much as Ukrainians had operatives [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=159.6s)]
*  in Russia. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=164.16s)]
*  I don't think that there aren't operatives from a host of different countries that came [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=165.16s)]
*  into the United States of America illegally. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=167.96s)]
*  Let's tie this to the previous conversation. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=170.44s)]
*  If you allow these individuals to fester here and remain unchecked, the problem grows. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=172.76s)]
*  If you have a Trump administration that says we're going to roll up everybody that's here [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=178.04s)]
*  illegally no matter what, and we're going to return them to your country of origin, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=181.51999999999998s)]
*  think of the intelligence that you gather off of that when you start rolling up a couple [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=185.8s)]
*  members that were former part of the IRGC, that are known and suspected terrorists, that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=189.62s)]
*  are worshiping at these specific mosques. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=194.23999999999998s)]
*  You get more intel to get you down the road for a better and safer America. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=197.73999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, and you have to imagine that Iran, with some of their capabilities rolled up over [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  the weekend, is going to be looking for some asymmetric wins in different places, and that's [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=206.79999999999998s)]
*  obviously a big concern with these potential cells. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=211.39999999999998s)]
*  Congressman Mass, thank you very much, sir. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=214.04s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  Good to see you. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-HrcP_eM5Lo&t=217.07999999999998s)]
