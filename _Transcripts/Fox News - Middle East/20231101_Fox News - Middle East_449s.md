# Karine Jean-Pierre dodges questions as Biden loses support from Muslims
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA)
*  The Israel-Hamas war could reshape the 2024 presidential election and potentially be a [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=0.0s)]
*  disaster for President Biden. Muslim Americans overwhelmingly voted for him in 2020. Support [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=5.48s)]
*  is slipping right now for Biden's support for Israel. The National Muslim Democratic [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=11.56s)]
*  Council wrote this open letter to Biden. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=18.12s)]
*  We pledge to mobilize Muslim, Arab and allied voters to withhold endorsement, support or [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=20.88s)]
*  any votes for any candidate who did not advocate for a ceasefire and endorse the Israeli offensive [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=25.76s)]
*  against the Palestinian people. National Secretary, our security spokesman John Kirby said Hamas [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=32.08s)]
*  may benefit more from a ceasefire than Israel. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=39.040000000000006s)]
*  In terms of a ceasefire, our concern with that is that Hamas benefits to the tune of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=43.64s)]
*  being able to refit, renew themselves, plan and execute additional attacks. And as I said [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=51.36s)]
*  yesterday, right now is not the time for a general ceasefire. It is, however, the time [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=60.2s)]
*  to consider pauses in the fighting. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=67.08s)]
*  A new op-ed from The Hill says supporting Israel is politically perilous for President [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=70.48s)]
*  Biden while Politico calls the issue a political wedge that will shape the contours of the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  2024 election cycle. I want to bring in former DNC Deputy Press Secretary Jose Aristomuno, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=80.88s)]
*  former Georgia Congressman Doug Collins will join us in a moment. Jose, first of all, give [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=87.64s)]
*  me the calculus that has to happen now for Biden in the White House and getting those [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=92.84s)]
*  Muslim votes. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=98.22s)]
*  Well, look, I think first and foremost, Harris, we have to understand that Biden has supported [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=99.22s)]
*  the Muslim community since the very beginning. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=104.36s)]
*  Yes, he got a big chunk in 2020. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=106.32s)]
*  That's right. And we support Israel. Look, Joe Biden understands that, number one, we [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=109.48s)]
*  need to defeat Hamas, we need to support the Jewish community. At the same time, we need [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=112.88000000000001s)]
*  to support the Muslim community. The long-term vision for this is a two-state solution. That's [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=116.36000000000001s)]
*  just reality. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  So, you know, the sort of letters by the Muslim Democrats, look, it's unrealistic to have [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=122.80000000000001s)]
*  a ceasefire if we're going to defeat Hamas. Let's be real. If we want to defeat a terrorist [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=128.36s)]
*  organization, we need to engage with the enemy, and that's what Biden, along with Israel, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=131.88s)]
*  is prepared to do. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=136.4s)]
*  So, that's interesting, because you basically said two things that might not be oppositional, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=137.6s)]
*  but I don't often hear them together. You've got to support Israel. And my question was, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  how do you keep the Muslim vote? And they're telling you that you're not going to get it [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=146.16s)]
*  unless you do what they say and don't support Israel in the way that you're supporting them [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=149.20000000000002s)]
*  right now. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=153.24s)]
*  You think you can do both those things? How do you get that Muslim vote? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=154.24s)]
*  There's no question about it. And look, Harris, we are a year away from a presidential election, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=157.84s)]
*  with all due respect to the leaders from the Muslim community that wrote this letter. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=163.8s)]
*  I just don't think that's true. I don't think that's representative of the Muslim community [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=167.8s)]
*  as a whole in the United States of America. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=172.28s)]
*  Look, it's been reported that there are estimates beyond 14 months for this war. So, I mean, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=173.96s)]
*  that's beyond what you're talking about. That might be a problem for Biden. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's get to this, and then, Doug, I'll come right to you. The White House yesterday danced [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=182.72000000000003s)]
*  around questions about the president's dip in support for Muslim Americans. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=186.08s)]
*  I'm not going to get into every poll, right? Paying attention, listening to what different [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=191.6s)]
*  communities are concerned about. Obviously, that is important to this president. I'm just [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=196.88s)]
*  not going to go into every poll from here. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=201.6s)]
*  What does that say, Doug? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=205.8s)]
*  It says they don't want to deal with it. And look, I appreciate my friend's response there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=206.8s)]
*  We do have to support Israel, but I think it is incongruent to hold both of those at [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=211.72s)]
*  the same time, especially given what the Muslim community in this letter and others and what [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=215.08s)]
*  we're seeing in the streets, Harris. We saw this just the other day when you and I were [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=219.64s)]
*  talking on Outnumbered. They're not for a two-state solution. They're not out peacefully [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=222.39999999999998s)]
*  protesting for a two-state solution. They're peacefully out protesting saying, we support [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  Hamas and the atrocities of Hamas, and we believe that many of them have been saying, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=232.23999999999998s)]
*  we support whatever they did in the atrocities and the brutality and the murder. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=236.56s)]
*  Again, I'm not sure how the Biden administration is going to dance around this, because they [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=241.79999999999998s)]
*  They don't want any help for Israel. They don't want to take Israel into account. They [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=245.04s)]
*  want Israel to be gone. This isn't a two-state solution protest here. This is an annihilation [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=250.16s)]
*  of the Jewish state protest. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=254.79999999999998s)]
*  Right. And I mean, Hamas has said that. I mean, this is existential for Israel right [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=256.28s)]
*  now. Hamas wants to wipe Jews off the face of the map. That would be a one-state solution [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=260.88s)]
*  on their part, but they won't be able to do it. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=265.76s)]
*  Campaign finance data now showing vulnerable Democratic lawmakers in 12 states have taken [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  donations from political action committees tied to anti-Israel squad members, those far-left [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=272.76s)]
*  members of the House. All those Democratic lawmakers who took these donations voted for [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=278.28s)]
*  the House resolution standing in solidarity with Israel in its war against Hamas. Again, [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=283.52s)]
*  pointing to a divide in the party. Makes sense of this. How does this work out, Jose? [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=289.2s)]
*  Look, it's politics, it's democracy. So every party has their extremes. We got maybe extremes [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=294.59999999999997s)]
*  on the left. The Republicans have problems on their own that they got to solve. I really [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=299.76s)]
*  believe— [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  All right, let's focus on your party now, because we're focused on Biden. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=305.03999999999996s)]
*  Well, look, I can tell you the president supports Israel. That's number one. That's the most [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=306.76s)]
*  important thing. He's met with Netanyahu. He's met with the president of Israel. And [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  he's going to continue to support him. The Jewish community supports Joe Biden, and he's [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=313.32s)]
*  with this president. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=316.59999999999997s)]
*  So what does he do to get that Muslim vote? I feel like I'm asking you the same question, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=318.28s)]
*  because I just want to know what you say about it. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=322.44s)]
*  It's not that— [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=324.64s)]
*  I mean, you were the deputy press secretary. I got to know for the DNC. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=325.64s)]
*  It's not that complicated. I think the president is able to walk and chew gum at the same time, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=328.64000000000004s)]
*  Harris. He's able to support the Jewish community and help the Muslim community as a whole. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  That's what we do. That's why he's the president of the United States. You can do both things. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=337.96000000000004s)]
*  If the Muslim voters don't turn out for him— [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=342.0s)]
*  They won't turn out. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=344.96000000000004s)]
*  —the way they did in 2020, what happens to Joe Biden? What percentage—what are we [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=345.96000000000004s)]
*  looking at in terms of what goes away? I think it's like 2 percent. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=351.88s)]
*  Look, I love how we're—a year— [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=355.0s)]
*  I'm going to go to Doug. Hold on. I'll come back to you. Go ahead, Doug. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=357.04s)]
*  Well, I think he's got a problem. And this idea that he can walk and chew gum at the [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=360.28s)]
*  same time is sort of funny at this, because there is no walking and chewing gum here. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=363.36s)]
*  It's either you're going to support Israel, which the Muslim community has in these letters [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=367.12s)]
*  have said, you support Israel, we're not going to support you. But I do have to agree with [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=371.64s)]
*  my friend. Where are they going to go? Are they going to stay at home? Are they not going [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=375.28s)]
*  to vote? And then they have to look at this from the perspective of that their position [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=377.8s)]
*  is staked out with the position of Hamas. This is what really— [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=382.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=385.36s)]
*  This is going to push actually not just Democrat voters, but it's going to push Republican [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=386.40000000000003s)]
*  voters to take a look at that. Maybe those independents who don't want to—who may [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=389.48s)]
*  or may not have any trouble with both parties, they're going to look at this and say, do [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=392.76s)]
*  I want to stand with groups that, you know, that are going against this with the president [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=395.8s)]
*  here? I want to stand with Israel. I'm not going to stand with this grouping here. So [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  if I think it's going to tear up the vote, especially in Michigan and places like that, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=404.76s)]
*  it's not an easy answer. And I don't think you can easily write it off as being betrayed [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=408.24s)]
*  here. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=412.24s)]
*  The other person that I mentioned that that vote might represent this time around, think [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=413.24s)]
*  about how small the margins are in some battleground states. But also think about third party competition. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=416.8s)]
*  You've got Dean Phillips on the left getting into the race too. The president's going [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=422.96000000000004s)]
*  to need every percentage vote that he can get. This becomes one of those things we watch [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=426.16s)]
*  for. Good to see you, gentlemen. Thank you. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yeaE-HCY1lA&t=430.88s)]
