# Iran threatens 'huge earthquake' for Israel, warns against Gaza invasion
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA)
*  Straight to a Fox News alert as tens of thousands of Israeli soldiers are getting ready for a full-scale invasion of Gaza as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=0.0s)]
*  airstrikes have continued throughout the night [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=7.12s)]
*  IDF issuing a statement saying quote forces are currently preparing to implement a wide range of operational offensive plans [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=19.68s)]
*  Which can include combined and coordinated strikes from the air sea and land end quote [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=27.28s)]
*  Hamas is responsible for the killing of at least 1300 Israelis and 29 US citizens [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu assuring his troops that more fighting is on the way [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=39.6s)]
*  You ready for the next stage the next stage is coming [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=46.52s)]
*  The [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=49.64s)]
*  New York Times reports that Israeli forces have delayed their initial plans as weather conditions in the area could worsen [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=55.52s)]
*  Meanwhile second US aircraft carrier is on its way to the Mediterranean Sea in what Defense Secretary Lord Austin calls a show of force [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=63.36s)]
*  As the US continues to affirm its support for Israel [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=71.4s)]
*  Despite that Iran is now warning Israel to stop the fighting immediately [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=75.48s)]
*  Saying any further action they take will cause a quote huge earthquake for Israel if their operations in Gaza [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=80.39999999999999s)]
*  Continue and now let's get to Trey Yates who's live on the ground in southern Israel Trey. What's the latest? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=88.44s)]
*  Yeah, hey guys you can see it's a stormy morning here in southern Israel [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=96.75999999999999s)]
*  We're next to a military base a lot of traffic headed into the base as reservists show up for duty [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=100.68s)]
*  Overnight more Israeli airstrikes targeted positions in the northern and central part of the Gaza Strip as civilians [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=106.24s)]
*  Continue to evacuate south. This is a significant development because there was a lot of buzz last night [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  The invasion could start overnight the weather could have something to do with it [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=118.42s)]
*  You can see it's quite rainy here [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=122.44s)]
*  You do have a lot of those ground troops and infantry troops that are in dirt areas that are now turning to mud [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=124.6s)]
*  All of this a part of the calculation for the Israelis as they monitor the situation here in the south [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=130.92s)]
*  Rocket fire continuing into Israeli population centers, but also the situation in the north [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=136.76s)]
*  We saw today three anti-tank guided missiles fired into Israel from southern Lebanon the Israelis responding striking Hezbollah targets [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=141.68s)]
*  Inside Lebanon but yet another [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=150.12s)]
*  indication the Lebanese militant group may try to get involved in this fight and something that Israel worries about [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=152.72s)]
*  Because if they do get involved at a full scale level [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=158.4s)]
*  It is something that will overwhelm Israel's air defense system and create a massive massive [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=161.76s)]
*  Problem for this army as they try to first destroy Hamas and also try to rescue those hostages guys, you know Trey I was [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=166.72s)]
*  Scrolling through my ex feed this morning [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=175.08s)]
*  And I came across a tweet from you just about 30 45 minutes ago that really stopped me down [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=177.68s)]
*  And while you're talking about the attacks in the north Trey you said on X [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=181.92000000000002s)]
*  There's an understanding on the ground that Israel Gaza could just be the beginning [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=185.52s)]
*  Look at the amount of American military assets headed this direction the evacuation of US citizens by sea [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=189.16s)]
*  Iranian foreign minister meeting with leaders of Hamas [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=195.08s)]
*  Uncertain days and of course, there's also as you put out the tax from Hezbollah [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=198.32s)]
*  What is the feeling of what is about to happen in the region? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=202.16s)]
*  Yeah, look yesterday [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=207.92s)]
*  I'll point you to a meeting that took place in Doha between the foreign minister of Iran and Ismael Hania the leader of Hamas [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=209.14s)]
*  This meeting took place in a very friendly tone [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  It was something that it was seen across the Middle East as yet another indication that Iran had advanced knowledge of what took place in [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Southern Israel that massacre last weekend [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=227.2s)]
*  But remember Iran just yesterday said they will be forced to get involved in this fight if the ground operation into Gaza moves forward [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=229.44s)]
*  The ground operation into Gaza is absolutely moving forward. It is not a question of if but rather when so when that does happen [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=237.2s)]
*  Israel has to be braced for not only rocket and missile fire from Lebanon [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=244.12s)]
*  But also the fact that Iran could fire on the Jewish state. They've got intercontinental ballistic missiles [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=248.0s)]
*  They could hit Israeli targets and it's a real concern for Israel as they try to work through the situation here in the south [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=252.8s)]
*  and Trey that ground offensive that you say it's not if but when I'm hearing conflicting reports about [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=259.56s)]
*  What the objective would for Israelis would be that there's a there's a sense that the idea of holding it is almost untenable [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=266.56s)]
*  I'm hearing deadlines of 18 months. If you're talking about 18 months on a ground invasion [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=274.08000000000004s)]
*  That's incredibly significant. So this delay is it really for weather in your sense there [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=280.12s)]
*  You said it was a you know, dicey today and what's your sense of what their objective is right now? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=285.24s)]
*  Yeah, look in terms of objectives they are going to enter the Gaza Strip [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=292.04s)]
*  But they're gonna hold territory the amount of troops that we've seen here is unlike anything I have seen in the past [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=295.6s)]
*  We are talking about tens of thousands of infantry troops. They're gonna first let me take you through this. This is important [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=301.32s)]
*  Actually, they're gonna first go in with bulldozers D9 bulldozers to ensure that they can get rid of any roadside bombs or booby traps [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=307.24s)]
*  On the way into Gaza, then they're gonna take in the tanks and the APC followed by the infantry troops [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=313.64s)]
*  This is a coordinated effort by the Israelis and once they get in they're not just simply going to destroy a few targets and leave [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  they're going to hold territory and [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=325.36s)]
*  Part of what's taking place is a preparation for that. I'm gonna put a jacket on here [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=327.88s)]
*  Quite rainy as you can see but part of what's taking place is preparation for that and when you look at the the fire along the border [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=333.15999999999997s)]
*  It is is really just clearing the path for what is to come. The Israelis understand once they get inside Gaza [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=340.88s)]
*  They're gonna need to hold buildings. They're going to be facing [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=347.12s)]
*  Forces like Hamas and Islamic Jihad that understand this territory very well [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=350.91999999999996s)]
*  They're gonna be popping out of tunnels firing RPGs [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=354.35999999999996s)]
*  Hand grenades small arms and and they have to be prepared for all of this [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=357.15999999999997s)]
*  They will be sitting ducks surrounded by enemy forces and we know from past conflicts around the world [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=361.64s)]
*  An insurgency is one of the most difficult things to defend against and that's exactly what they'll be facing when they're inside the Gaza Strip [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=367.28s)]
*  Trey as we talk about this war [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=374.76s)]
*  Expanding and this imminence of the ground invasion [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=377.64s)]
*  Can you tell us any more about the civilians because I'm hearing conflicting reports about whether they can get out [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=381.54s)]
*  Whether Hamas is blocking them from getting out or whether the countries from which they're supposed to exit from are blocking that exit [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=387.94s)]
*  Yes, so the Israelis have opened up to evacuation corridors in Gaza basically when I say opened up [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=397.74s)]
*  I mean they've agreed not to strike those corridors and they're telling all civilians not just in Gaza City [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=402.78s)]
*  But in the entire northern part of the Gaza Strip, they must evacuate south if they don't they are at risk of being killed [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=407.86s)]
*  when the Israelis entered the Gaza Strip and [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=414.42s)]
*  So we've seen the images thousands of people heading south trying to get out of the way [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=416.42s)]
*  Toward the city of Hanunis the second largest city in Gaza and even further south to the city of Rafa [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=420.34000000000003s)]
*  Near the Egyptian border what is of note here though is Hamas [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=425.62s)]
*  We had reporting that indicated Hamas is keeping people from leaving their houses before Israeli airstrikes [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=429.86s)]
*  Well, the Israeli military now says Hamas is keeping people from driving south in some areas and even tried to set up roadblocks [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=435.06s)]
*  All of this is a concern because you've got two million people inside Gaza [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=441.85999999999996s)]
*  The vast majority are not militants the death toll among civilians women and children is rising rapidly and there are very [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=445.78s)]
*  concerning and real reports from inside Gaza of people running out of not just food but also water and so there's a [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=452.78s)]
*  Humanitarian crisis developing in parallel to what's taking place and a solution needs to rise to the surface [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=459.2s)]
*  To help get those civilians out of the way [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=464.96s)]
*  So the Israelis can operate and do the job that they say they plan to do which is destroy Hamas and try to rescue those [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=467.03999999999996s)]
*  hostages [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=472.96s)]
*  Well, Trey will let you get out of that rain get dry for a little bit [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=474.32s)]
*  We'll check in with you a little bit later in the hour. Thank you [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPGBJtgS1EA&t=477.36s)]
