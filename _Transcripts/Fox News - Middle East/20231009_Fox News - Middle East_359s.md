# 'NO DRILLS': Activist recalls harrowing escape from Israel amid Hamas attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c)
*  I want to break out of that commercial break to show you these live images out of Gaza [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=0.0s)]
*  City right now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=4.2s)]
*  This is probably the most activity we've seen in about an hour and 15 minutes. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=5.36s)]
*  This is Israel attacking Gaza City. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=11.36s)]
*  There are lots of explosions, lots of smoke. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=13.88s)]
*  At one point, if we get this image again, we can show you, you saw something fly up [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=16.84s)]
*  way high up into the air as Israel responds to the horrendous terrorist attack that has [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=20.8s)]
*  claimed the lives of at least 800 men, women and children, over 100 hostages, and nine [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=27.8s)]
*  of those killed were Americans. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=34.480000000000004s)]
*  We do not have a number on the hostages. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=36.32s)]
*  We are working on that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=38.36s)]
*  So these are the live images here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=39.36s)]
*  And these terrorist attacks in Israel forced my next guest to shelter with her family underground. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  She posted a video online describing what happened. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=47.08s)]
*  Let's take a look here. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=49.88s)]
*  The sirens started going off. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=53.28s)]
*  Stella came to me and said, Mommy, there's a bomb drill. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=56.16s)]
*  I said, in Israel, they don't have bomb drills. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  She started freaking out. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=62.31999999999999s)]
*  She grabbed Ali, jetted to the stairwell, to the bomb shelter. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=63.48s)]
*  We were in and out of that bomb shelter for the better part of the day. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=68.72s)]
*  Joining me now is Lizzie Sovetsky. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=73.19999999999999s)]
*  She is an American activist for Israel. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=75.16s)]
*  And Lizzie, you just landed and came straight here, and we appreciate that. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=77.28s)]
*  Take us back to that morning. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=82.52s)]
*  I know in the video you explained it, but now that you had a little bit of distance [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=83.96s)]
*  to think about it, what do you remember? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=87.6s)]
*  Unfortunately, that was really just the beginning of some of the scary things. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=90.32s)]
*  I haven't even had a chance to share with my followers what had happened since we left [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  for the airport, our situation on the airplane. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=101.72s)]
*  But going back to the beginning, we were celebrating the Jewish holiday of Simchat Torah. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=105.08s)]
*  We had been in Israel for Sukkot. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=111.32s)]
*  We did not have our phones because we are observant. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=113.44s)]
*  So we had no idea what was going on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=118.48s)]
*  We didn't know that the attacks had started at 6.30 a.m. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=120.39999999999999s)]
*  The first we heard was at around 8.30 in Jerusalem. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=124.72s)]
*  The siren, the red alert siren, started going off. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  And we're not used to hearing these things. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  Of course, people that live in Israel are more on high alert than we are as American [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=135.96s)]
*  tourists. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=140.2s)]
*  My daughter came in and she said somebody in the hotel says that there's a bomb drill. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  How old is she? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=146.88s)]
*  She's 10 years old. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=147.88s)]
*  I knew that there's no drills in Israel. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=152.6s)]
*  She grabbed my three-year-old son and started sprinting down the stairs. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=155.88s)]
*  I was putting on my shoes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=160.12s)]
*  She was yelling to me, mommy, we don't have time to put on our shoes. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=161.32s)]
*  Just sheer panic. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=164.72s)]
*  So she knows. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=165.72s)]
*  She knows. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=166.79999999999998s)]
*  She knows. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=167.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, I'm an Israel activist, so we talk about these things, but it's usually more [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  from a theoretical perspective, not something that we've lived personally. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=174.84s)]
*  I've lived in Israel, but I've never been in a bomb shelter. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=179.84s)]
*  So this was a first. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=183.12s)]
*  So what happened to you on the way to the airport? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  So when we got on the airplane, we heard that certain parts of the airport were on lockdown [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=187.52s)]
*  and people were in bomb shelters and people started whispering to each other on the plane [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=195.4s)]
*  that they were seeing on Twitter images of the Iron Dome shooting down rockets right [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=201.92s)]
*  directly over the airport. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  And you know, I was sitting in a row with my husband and my three-year-old son. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=210.35999999999999s)]
*  My girls are sitting in front of us. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=215.04s)]
*  I didn't want to make them nervous, but we were absolutely terrified. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=216.44s)]
*  We didn't know. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=220.74s)]
*  You know, we're stuck on this airplane. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=221.74s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  And everyone said together the Jewish Traveler's Prayer in one line, and it is, save us from [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=225.32s)]
*  our enemies. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=230.84s)]
*  And it's something that we say every time we're on an airplane, but it had never felt [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=232.24s)]
*  so poignant. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=235.68s)]
*  I could talk to you for hours, but I did want to get to this just so that we can get your [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=236.68s)]
*  reaction to it, because I should just interview Guy Benson and Josh Crosshart talking about [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=240.04s)]
*  here in America, you had the rallies, pro-Israel and against, yesterday, and the New York Post [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=244.88s)]
*  cover says, vile rally. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=252.28s)]
*  Just the headline. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=254.23999999999998s)]
*  The squad members in Congress. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay, so this is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ilhan Omar. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=258.59999999999997s)]
*  We can put this up on the screen, call for number three. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=262.15999999999997s)]
*  They are calling for ceasefire. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=264.92s)]
*  And ceasefire. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=268.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm sorry, when did the Israelis fire? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=269.03999999999996s)]
*  I'm missing something. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=272.24s)]
*  How can people without weapons who are innocent civilians, children, old elderly, 85-year-old [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=274.52s)]
*  woman, a Holocaust survivor, these people aren't armed, so I don't know what they mean [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=282.48s)]
*  by ceasefire. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=286.64s)]
*  I find that highly offensive. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=287.64s)]
*  And I think that anyone that is rallying in favor of this right now really needs to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=289.48s)]
*  check their moral compass, because we're talking about innocent women who have been raped, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=293.96s)]
*  paraded through the streets with blood coming down their legs. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=298.88s)]
*  These images are the most horrific things that I've seen since Holocaust times, and [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=302.52s)]
*  anyone to say that Israel did anything to deserve this is just insane. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=308.68s)]
*  Do you have friends that have people that they know that were killed or that are being [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=314.12s)]
*  held hostage? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=318.32s)]
*  I do. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=319.52s)]
*  I have a close friend who I grew up with whose cousin is missing being held hostage. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=320.52s)]
*  She was on one of the kibbutz that was taken over. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=324.91999999999996s)]
*  And Israel is a small country. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=329.24s)]
*  The Jewish people are very tight. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=331.35999999999996s)]
*  There's not that many of us. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  So we're all about one degree of separation away from somebody who's been directly impacted. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=335.8s)]
*  How can people follow you? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=340.44s)]
*  You can follow me at Lizzy Sawetzky, L-I-Z-Z-Y Sawetzky, S-A-V-E-T-S-K-Y on Instagram, and [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=342.06s)]
*  I'll be continuing to post as I have been my personal experiences as well as what's [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FkWcQXse-8c&t=348.6s)]
