# US military moving ships and aircraft closer to Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs)
*  And we do have breaking news for you, a U.S. military official telling Fox News, the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=0.0s)]
*  is moving Navy ships and military aircraft closer to Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=6.2s)]
*  Again, a U.S. military official telling Fox News, the U.S. is moving Navy ships and military [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=11.52s)]
*  aircraft closer to Israel. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=17.68s)]
*  This is as we continue to follow what some in Israel are calling their 9-11. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=20.96s)]
*  So far, at least 600 reportedly killed in yesterday's savage attacks by Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=28.2s)]
*  And we are learning more about the U.S. military, again, what they're doing in response. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=36.44s)]
*  We have Lucas Tomlinson. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=41.24s)]
*  He is live at the White House. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=43.08s)]
*  And as soon as Lucas is ready to get in front of the camera, we'll take you there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=44.599999999999994s)]
*  Lucas, what more can you tell us? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=49.28s)]
*  I want to ask you, what is this signal and where were these Navy ships stationed? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=51.480000000000004s)]
*  Arthel, you had the USS Bataan, that's a amphibious assault ship that was already on station in [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=57.96s)]
*  the Persian Gulf. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=62.68s)]
*  That ship will have 2,000 Marines on board and dozens of aircraft. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=63.68s)]
*  It is not an aircraft carrier, though. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  It will have the Vesal, the vertical short takeoff and landing aircraft. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=68.48s)]
*  That would be like a Harrier, a Marine Corps Harrier. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=72.52s)]
*  Also Joint Strike Fighter. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=75.48s)]
*  You also have those Vipers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  Those are Marine Corps attack helicopters, similar to some of our older viewers who know [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=78.32000000000001s)]
*  the Cobras, and also Huey gunships. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=81.84s)]
*  Those will be in the Persian Gulf. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  Not quite clear if they're going to be leaving the Persian Gulf, but however, of course, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=87.56s)]
*  what's right there? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  You have Iran. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  So you'd want to make sure a naval presence is right there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=92.96000000000001s)]
*  Now you also in the Mediterranean, you have the USS Gerald Ford Strike Group. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=95.96000000000001s)]
*  You have any kind of aircraft carrier strike group. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  We'll have a number of Navy escorts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=103.4s)]
*  You'll have cruisers. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=105.60000000000001s)]
*  You'll have guided missile destroyers. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  And normally, even though the Navy doesn't talk about it much, you'll also have a submarine [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=108.32000000000001s)]
*  as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=111.08000000000001s)]
*  Now, the big question is, will Hamas know that these ships have been moved closer? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=112.08s)]
*  Right now, it appears only the Israeli forces would know this, and also, of course, through [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=118.2s)]
*  the press reports. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=123.32s)]
*  But how close are those going to get? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=124.92s)]
*  Of course, territorial waters extends 12 miles offshore. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=126.56s)]
*  Not likely you're going to have a U.S. warship on the horizon, Arthel. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=131.32s)]
*  So this appears to be a very symbolic move. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=135.2s)]
*  Capitol Hill, if there are American hostages that Hamas captured yesterday, will the U.S. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=139.16s)]
*  military spin up and deploy a Tier 1 Special Operations Forces, hostage rescue forces, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=146.68s)]
*  to aid Israel in the recapture of, again, potentially American hostages? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=152.8s)]
*  Secretary of State Andy Blinken was on the Sunday shows earlier. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=158.68s)]
*  He said that is a possibility. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=162.14s)]
*  These are reports right now. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=163.14s)]
*  We cannot confirm that independently. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=164.85999999999999s)]
*  Running this down, did Hamas also capture American citizens? [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=167.16s)]
*  Of course, American citizens perhaps with dual nationality, Arthel. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=171.44s)]
*  Yeah, and we're looking live here at 7.56 p.m. local time in Gaza. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=176.6s)]
*  Explosion is still happening. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=181.88s)]
*  This war is red hot, Lucas. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=183.68s)]
*  You said this is symbolic. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=185.8s)]
*  We will see how the follow-through unfolds. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=187.18s)]
*  Thank you very much, Lucas Tomlinson. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKjFcCydeGs&t=190.56s)]
