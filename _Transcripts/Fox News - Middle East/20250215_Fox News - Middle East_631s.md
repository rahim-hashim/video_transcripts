# Israeli leaders face a ‘terrible’ decision, former ambassador says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk)
*  For more on this, let's bring in Michael Oren, former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=0.0s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=5.16s)]
*  So there you have it, the latest hostage exchange, three Israelis including an Israeli American [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=8.08s)]
*  for 369 Palestinian prisoners, including 36 individuals who are on, who are serving life [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=12.94s)]
*  sentences for acts of terrorism. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=20.240000000000002s)]
*  One of those individuals, one of those terrorists killed 12 Israelis, linked to the deaths [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=22.7s)]
*  of 12 Israelis. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=29.16s)]
*  You've been critical of this ceasefire in that you have, you have voiced your concern [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=30.72s)]
*  that this could in fact empower Hamas in some way. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=35.72s)]
*  What do you make of this latest prisoner exchange and where the negotiations are right now? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  Well, it's excruciating, Brian. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=45.8s)]
*  It's excruciating for Israelis. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=48.519999999999996s)]
*  On one hand, there's the joy of the reunion of these three hostages with their families. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=50.28s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=55.04s)]
*  Another American Israeli, another Russian Israeli, another Argentinian Israeli shows [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=56.04s)]
*  the international scope of this. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  On the other hand, we are releasing these terrorists, 369 terrorists who have blood [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=61.7s)]
*  on their hands. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=66.48s)]
*  And we know from previous exchanges that about 80% of them go back to committing terror. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=67.48s)]
*  The former head of Hamas who was eliminated, Yeheh Sinwar, had been released in an earlier [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=71.56s)]
*  exchange. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=75.72s)]
*  So we know that and they'll go on to kill more Israelis. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=76.72s)]
*  And also Hamas, Hamas, if we move into a second phase of the ceasefire, Hamas will basically [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=79.94s)]
*  regain control of the Gaza Strip and prepare the next October 7th because its leaders say [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=85.67999999999999s)]
*  they will keep on mounting attacks against Israel until Israel is destroyed. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=89.84s)]
*  At the end of the day, Israeli society is a unique society and this is the price that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=94.36s)]
*  Israelis are willing to pay to get these hostages home. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=98.92s)]
*  But we also understand the severity of the price. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=101.84s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, they're at 12 o'clock today, which was the deadline [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=105.28s)]
*  imposed by President Trump for Hamas to release all hostages. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=109.24s)]
*  President Trump went on True Social and said, look, with this exchange of the three hostages, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=113.52s)]
*  I'll leave it up to Benjamin Netanyahu if they're going to end this ceasefire. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=117.16s)]
*  It appears he had a Netanyahu had a security meeting at noon and the ceasefire truce continues. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=121.76s)]
*  What's the calculus right now you think when he had that meeting with his security team [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=128.72s)]
*  for Benjamin Netanyahu right now into deciding whether or not to continue with phase one [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=133.96s)]
*  of this deal? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=138.0s)]
*  That is the big question that everyone's asking tonight. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=139.8s)]
*  The answer appears to be this. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=141.60000000000002s)]
*  The army has been fighting now for close to 500 days. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=143.68s)]
*  It needs arrests low on ammunition. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  Give the army a chance to catch its breath and build up its arsenal again. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=149.16000000000003s)]
*  But beyond that, if we go back to fighting in Gaza, we have to be able to say to ourselves, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  honestly, that the 30 remaining hostages who are alive may not be so. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=157.16000000000003s)]
*  Because if the Israeli army had proceeded on the assumption once upon a time that if [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=163.08s)]
*  you ratchet up the pressure on Hamas, it releases terrorists, we found out when we ratched up [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=167.08s)]
*  the pressure, Hamas doesn't release the terrorists, it shoots the terror and shoots the hostages [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=171.44s)]
*  rather. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=175.6s)]
*  And so it's a terrible decision that the government has to make. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=176.6s)]
*  And I don't think any Israeli government is prepared to go out to the population and saying, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  listen, these reunions that we've seen between these families, those 30 remaining hostages [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  are not going to have those reunions because they're going to be executed by Hamas. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=189.28s)]
*  Ambassador Orrin, we have a shot up here at Tel Aviv. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=193.88s)]
*  This is Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has arrived in Israel tonight, Israeli time [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=197.06s)]
*  there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=204.38000000000002s)]
*  The goal for the secretary of the United States here is how to get this ceasefire, we assume [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=205.38s)]
*  into phase two of this truce, which under phase two is the release of all the remaining [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=210.46s)]
*  hostages and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=216.38s)]
*  What do you think needs to happen from the United States perspective to make sure that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=222.54s)]
*  this does enter phase two? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=227.73999999999998s)]
*  Well, in great contrast to the previous administration's policy, Marco Rubio has said that every Palestinian [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=229.66s)]
*  civilian killed in Gaza is killed because of Hamas, not because of Israel. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=236.5s)]
*  National Security Advisor Mike Waltz said tonight that Hamas must be destroyed. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=240.89999999999998s)]
*  Hamas is not going to be part of the future of Gaza. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=244.45999999999998s)]
*  So I think that the Secretary of State will be discussing with Israeli leaders how after [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=248.02s)]
*  the second phase, once we get all the hostages back, once Hamas is regaining control in Gaza, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  how then can we renew the conflict, the struggle against Hamas and eliminate it entirely? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=257.90000000000003s)]
*  But there's also going to be a bigger picture, Brian. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=264.38s)]
*  It's what's going to happen in Lebanon, what's going to happen in Syria, whether Syria will [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=266.22s)]
*  remain a threat to Israel, and above all, what's going to happen with Iran and the Iranian [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=269.18s)]
*  program, as reports have been circulated that the Iranian regime is very close to making [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=274.94s)]
*  a crude nuclear device. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=278.7s)]
*  Yeah, no doubt. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=280.34s)]
*  And you know, Ambassador, you've spoken about this. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=281.54s)]
*  The real risk here of empowering Hamas and undermining the Palestinian authority, when [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=285.26s)]
*  they release these hostages to Israel, they're having essentially, they're parading them. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=290.42s)]
*  Hamas right now is in a position where they are seen, perhaps it seems, as the group that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=295.38s)]
*  is providing aid, allowing for aid to come into Gaza at this moment through these exchanges. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=300.7s)]
*  What's the risk here that the Palestinian Authority will be further undermined and that [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=307.09999999999997s)]
*  Hamas will then be strengthened as this ceasefire continues? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=311.74s)]
*  Well, one thing, the Palestinian Authority does much to undermine itself. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=316.5s)]
*  It hasn't been able to fight off Hamas in parts of the West Bank and the northern part [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  of Samaria and Janine. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=324.18s)]
*  It's failed to do so. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=325.86s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority has even refrained from condemning the horrors of October 7th. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=328.14s)]
*  It doesn't distinguish itself much from Hamas. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=332.65999999999997s)]
*  At the end of the day, it's not the Palestinian Authority's authority or stature we have to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=336.29999999999995s)]
*  worry about. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=341.41999999999996s)]
*  It's our security. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=342.41999999999996s)]
*  And our security can only be guaranteed if Hamas is destroyed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=343.41999999999996s)]
*  And this is what Mike Walz has said tonight. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=346.65999999999997s)]
*  Hamas must be destroyed. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=348.73999999999995s)]
*  He's absolutely right. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=350.26s)]
*  But we also have to get the hostages back first. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=351.41999999999996s)]
*  When Secretary of State Marco Rubio meets here in Israel with his counterparts, I'm [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=354.74s)]
*  wondering, what role does President Trump's latest proposal about displacing 2 million [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=360.58s)]
*  Palestinians out of Gaza, taking control of Gaza, which has been met with just widespread [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=365.58s)]
*  condemnation from the Arab world, what role does that new idea play in the negotiations [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=370.65999999999997s)]
*  here and in the continuing, whether or not this ceasefire can continue? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=380.41999999999996s)]
*  I think it's changed the conversation, Brian. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=385.14s)]
*  The conversation for the last 30 years, and I've been involved in that peace process for [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=387.06s)]
*  30 years, has been that the only way you can move forward in the Middle East diplomatically [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=390.53999999999996s)]
*  is by creating a Palestinian state, because without the Palestinian state, so the old [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=395.09999999999997s)]
*  school used to say, that's the source of all the instability in the Middle East, because [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=399.26s)]
*  there's no Palestinian state. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=403.41999999999996s)]
*  Along comes President Trump and says, no, the source of instability in the Middle East [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=404.41999999999996s)]
*  is the Palestinian pension for violence. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=407.94s)]
*  And that Palestinian pension for violence is a result of socioeconomic conditions in [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=410.65999999999997s)]
*  the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=414.22s)]
*  You correct those conditions and you're going to get a lot less violence. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=415.22s)]
*  So I think that principle, that notion has changed the dialogue, has changed the discussion [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=419.1s)]
*  about the Middle East and about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=424.06s)]
*  Now, the big question, how can this be implemented? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=426.98s)]
*  Where would these Palestinians move to? [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=429.54s)]
*  Those are technical issues. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=431.02000000000004s)]
*  But what has been established is a principle. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=432.82000000000005s)]
*  And there's no way back from this. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=435.54s)]
*  There's a principle that says we have to get to the core of the conflict. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=436.54s)]
*  This is the core. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=441.54s)]
*  And I think about 80% of Israelis agree with him. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=443.22s)]
*  Do you think the Arab world will continue to support this, given the fact that this [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=446.66s)]
*  proposal has been on the table? [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=450.54s)]
*  I know the president met with the Jordanian king and they spoke about this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=451.54s)]
*  The Jordanian king was not a fan of this proposal by Trump. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=456.38s)]
*  I mean, I got to think, I just want to get your thoughts on the X factor here, which [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=459.46000000000004s)]
*  is now President Trump and how that might be playing a role here moving forward. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=464.02000000000004s)]
*  Well, I think no one's really disagreeing with the principle that Gaza has to be [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=469.90000000000003s)]
*  reconstructed. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=473.3s)]
*  And having spent a lot of time in Gaza as a soldier, as a civilian, it's beautiful [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=474.46000000000004s)]
*  beachfront. Everyone's right. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=478.94000000000005s)]
*  And that the potential there is immense. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=480.1s)]
*  The question is, how do you realize the potential? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=482.90000000000003s)]
*  And what the president is saying, it's very difficult to realize that potential if [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=484.54s)]
*  you have two and two point two million people, refugees living in tents and [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=488.1s)]
*  they're sitting on top of about 30,000 unexploded bombs. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=492.26000000000005s)]
*  It's very difficult to do. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=494.98s)]
*  I think people in the Middle East will generally agree that building Gaza and [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=496.70000000000005s)]
*  making it into a prosperous, secure zone without Hamas is a very, very good idea. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=499.86s)]
*  It's actually an essential idea. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=504.54s)]
*  How do you get to that ideal? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=505.90000000000003s)]
*  That's where the states people, the politicians sit down and knock their heads [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=507.42s)]
*  together and come up with a solution. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=511.86s)]
*  And real quick here, do you think that this ceasefire continues into phase two? [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=513.3000000000001s)]
*  My gut feeling tells me it really has to. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=519.26s)]
*  Again, Israelis want to see these hostages home. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=521.0600000000001s)]
*  They're not willing to say that the 30 hostages are going to die, that they [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=523.62s)]
*  won't have those reunions with those families. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=526.94s)]
*  It's just too difficult. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=528.74s)]
*  We are we are unusual society in that way. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=530.26s)]
*  The Israeli parents send their kids into the army with the understanding with the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=532.62s)]
*  state that the state will do everything possible to free their their children if [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=536.86s)]
*  they're ever taken captive. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=540.34s)]
*  And that's sort of a basis of the way we defend ourselves from war to war. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=542.18s)]
*  And we're willing to take immense risks in order to preserve that principle, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=546.74s)]
*  including the resistive of releasing terrorists who most probably will go back to [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=549.98s)]
*  being terrorists in the future. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=554.4200000000001s)]
*  It's a difficult I understand it's a difficult dynamic to understand. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=556.38s)]
*  It's peculiar to Israel. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=560.3000000000001s)]
*  We have no choice. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=562.0200000000001s)]
*  At the end of the day, we will continue to struggle against Hamas until Hamas is [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=563.22s)]
*  eliminated. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=566.86s)]
*  And here we have Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the tarmac there in Tel Aviv, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=567.38s)]
*  greeting his counterparts there in Israel. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=571.7800000000001s)]
*  The main goal for Secretary of State Michael for Marco Rubio is what? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=575.0999999999999s)]
*  Ambassador Michael Warren. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=580.6999999999999s)]
*  The main goal is the next steps in Gaza, [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=581.6199999999999s)]
*  pursuing pursuing the Israeli Saudi peace agreement, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=584.42s)]
*  ensuring that Hezbollah will remain cobbled and coward in Lebanon, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=589.06s)]
*  assuring that the Syrian situation and we don't know who's going to be in control [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=595.06s)]
*  of this situation will not threaten not Israel, not Jordan, [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=598.78s)]
*  other countries in the Middle East. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=601.8599999999999s)]
*  And ultimately, as I said earlier, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=603.26s)]
*  the big issue is going to be Iran. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=604.62s)]
*  And what are we going to do about the Iranian nuclear program? [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=606.9s)]
*  Well, we shall see an important visit by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=610.34s)]
*  former Israeli ambassador to the U.S. Michael Warren. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=613.6600000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much for being with us through that landing there. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=616.58s)]
*  I appreciate that. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=620.02s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_ZIdT3VcJk&t=620.62s)]
