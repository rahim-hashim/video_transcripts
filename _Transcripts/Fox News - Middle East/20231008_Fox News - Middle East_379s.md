# Israel war could be ‘much bigger’ than Russia-Ukraine: Expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE)
*  We're back with the Fox News alert Joe Biden offering verbal support for Israel while critics call out the administration's appeasement of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=0.0s)]
*  Israel's enemies our next guest agrees and says the US has been too distracted by the Russia-Ukraine war [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=7.32s)]
*  Independent Women's Forum senior fellow. Dr. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=14.56s)]
*  Kanta Ahmed has previously spent time at the Gaza border with Israel Defense Forces and she joins us now with her insights [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=16.64s)]
*  Good morning to you. Dr. Ahmed [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=23.16s)]
*  As you look at the news over the past 36 hours, what is your top line thought? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=25.16s)]
*  first of all Israel and [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=29.599999999999998s)]
*  All those people like us that are invested in peace in the region pluralist Muslims are [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=31.919999999999998s)]
*  under siege by terrorist organizations Hamas and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=39.2s)]
*  Hezbollah Hamas has launched this assault with Palestinian Islamic Jihad, which is also a terrorist group [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=43.4s)]
*  They want to reignite what we've just lived through the global war on terror [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Radical Islam against the world radical Islam dividing the Muslim world the war in which you served [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=53.92s)]
*  And and so that's the first message the second message is this is an attempt to scupper the Israel-Palestinian [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=60.0s)]
*  deal [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=67.24s)]
*  That Jared Kushner envisioned and the Saudi Arabian Israel [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=68.96s)]
*  Detente that the Abraham Accords presents. This is multi-pronged [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=73.92s)]
*  We were both of us on the South Lawn and September 15th [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=78.67999999999999s)]
*  I believe it was of 2020 in that historic moment first time since 1994 [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=82.84s)]
*  You saw a peace accord UAE was there Bahrain, of course the United States that was under President Trump [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=87.8s)]
*  That was September of 2020 you fast forward here. We are September of 2023. We don't have a peace accord right now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=92.72s)]
*  We have a really unprecedented attack on Israel. Is that any accident or is it a change in leadership? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=98.44s)]
*  I think that [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=104.04s)]
*  Hamas which is working as a proxy for Iran was looking for a golden opportunity [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=105.72s)]
*  I think it has to be tied with the extraordinary dialogue [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=111.28s)]
*  We saw Brett Baier having with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman who indicated to the world that we were very close to having an agreement [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=115.2s)]
*  And I think also there were events during the Jewish holiday of Sukkot at al-Aqsa compound [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=123.32s)]
*  Which inflamed a lot of sentiments but that is just an excuse for a very carefully planned assault on the Jewish state [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=129.56s)]
*  Sovereignty and an assault on the region. This may not be like any conflict we've ever seen [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=138.08s)]
*  It's gonna be very difficult to contain this to Hamas [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=143.12s)]
*  Gaza and Israel it can spill out across the region and this should not be seen really as anything other than an [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=147.12s)]
*  unveiled [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=155.08s)]
*  Direct conflict of Iran with Israel. That's why [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=156.16s)]
*  Saudi-Arabia UAE Egypt Jordan are all working on the telephones to try and contain this [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=161.52s)]
*  Before it becomes uncontainable. Do you think Iran wants it contained? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=168.48s)]
*  I mean Iran wants it to spill out and what what would it look like if Iran actually had a nuclear device? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=173.32s)]
*  I mean, well, what's their ultimate what's a reminder viewers what Iran's ultimate goal is here when as it pertains to [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=178.72s)]
*  They've said it explicitly their own supreme leaders say [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=185.32s)]
*  explicitly the eradication the elimination of the Jewish state the war that Hamas and Hezbollah that is shortly I [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=189.79999999999998s)]
*  Think poised to attack at Israel's northern border. Their war is a cosmic [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=197.0s)]
*  Fanatical enmity with global jury every Jewish person on the planet is an enemy in their [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=203.24s)]
*  Islamist ideology that is an ideology Saudi Arabia has spent decades [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=210.28s)]
*  Eliminating I've just traveled to Saudi Arabia [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=215.16s)]
*  Very recently a couple of times they have eliminated anti-semitism and anti-zionism from their curricula [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=218.16s)]
*  The whole reason the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is making peace [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=225.12s)]
*  Dialogue with Israel is because Saudi Arabia has issued that ideology [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=229.92s)]
*  That's that's the past that is not the future of Saudi Arabia [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  Iran wants to reignite that and Iran does want this to spill beyond Iran has essentially [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  Lebanon eyes colonized Syria [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=245.76s)]
*  Lebanon is captive to Hezbollah, which is a a terrorist [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=248.6s)]
*  very very ferocious [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  battle-hardened military [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=255.79999999999998s)]
*  Iran has [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=257.84s)]
*  IRGC missile bases that operate out of Iraq without impunity Iraq is [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=259.44s)]
*  Under the yoke of Iran and we have Yemen which is equivalent to Saudi Arabia's [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=265.88s)]
*  Afghanistan a terrible humanitarian catastrophe and in an entrenched conflict [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=272.36s)]
*  Which is in a fragile state that could also be a place from where to? [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=278.08s)]
*  Launch operations while you are in in the White House [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=283.08s)]
*  We saw Saudi Aramco in 2019 attacked by Iranian drones and that is an assault not only on Saudi Arabia [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=286.59999999999997s)]
*  But the world's oil markets oil futures are already rising for tomorrow morning [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=293.92s)]
*  So this is colossal and on the background of Russia and Ukraine [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=299.32s)]
*  the United States has been [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=304.12s)]
*  Incredibly depleted by the war in Russian Ukraine with soldiers armaments [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=307.20000000000005s)]
*  Psychological energy there's been a tremendous [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=312.48s)]
*  Suffering on the Ukrainians. There's people dying on the Russian side. The world is drained by that conflict now [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=316.44s)]
*  We're looking at something that could be much much bigger [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=323.12s)]
*  And just the precedent the Trump administration said the first foreign trip was to Saudi Arabia [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=326.6s)]
*  Indicating this region matters to us [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=331.68s)]
*  And that's why I think we shouldn't lose hope because we have an 80 year relationship with Saudi Arabia [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=334.28000000000003s)]
*  Jared Kushner and President Trump had the vision of [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=339.32s)]
*  economic investment and stability [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  For the Palestinian people to the tune of 50 billion dollars [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=344.88s)]
*  That's in the Peace to Prosperity report which is as big as a telephone directory that you can all read [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=349.15999999999997s)]
*  That was the vision in order to prevent this Iran doesn't give any other vision except annihilation and [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpF-1EPO7vE&t=354.47999999999996s)]
