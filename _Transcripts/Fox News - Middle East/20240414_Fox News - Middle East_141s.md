# 'WEAKNESS': Trump slams Biden for not deterring Iran's attack
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 14, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM)
*  So, Jackie, you know, we kind of talked about this a minute ago, but it is true. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, this and a whole array of catastrophes that are going on around the world, you can [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=5.36s)]
*  make the argument would not have happened if under under President Trump and his policies. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=10.5s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=15.08s)]
*  You can make that argument and he would make it himself if President Biden would be willing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  to get up and debate him. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=19.88s)]
*  This is the first time that we've got two presidents with a track record and they can [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  go toe to toe on each issue. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=24.96s)]
*  You know, as well as I do, the handlers don't want Biden getting up on the stage because [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=27.56s)]
*  you don't know what will happen when he's off script. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=31.279999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=33.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=34.36s)]
*  And I can't think of anything more important to have a fulsome debate on but this. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=35.36s)]
*  Griff, media organizations got together and sent a letter to the candidates saying, though [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=37.92s)]
*  it is too early for invitations to be extended to any candidate, it's not too early for [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=42.76s)]
*  candidates who expect to meet the eligibility criteria to publicly state their support for [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=46.4s)]
*  and their intention to participate in the commission's debates plan for this fall. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  Would you imagine in 2024, two people running for president and not debating? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=57.02s)]
*  Well, the vice presidential debate is already set for September. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=63.38s)]
*  So you're going to let the vice president have a debate and you're not. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=67.5s)]
*  Look, here's the thing. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=70.14s)]
*  I'll just tell you what I think. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=71.26s)]
*  This is my own theory and it could be completely wrong. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=72.42s)]
*  But I think that the Biden fully intensive debate and is wants everyone to tug and beg [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=75.22s)]
*  and plead and so that people will play down, say, well, he doesn't want he's holding out [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=83.14s)]
*  because he can't do it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=87.58s)]
*  He can't do it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=88.86s)]
*  Set the expectations so low and then he over delivers. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=89.86s)]
*  Well, if the media doesn't absolutely go crazy over this, it's malpractice on their part. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=93.1s)]
*  Well, I just absolutely. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=98.42s)]
*  And I just think President Biden refusing to commit to a debate is the most anti-democratic [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=99.42s)]
*  thing that I certainly see. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=104.02s)]
*  You cannot just have a monologue. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=105.42s)]
*  That is like people just being on social media. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=106.86s)]
*  You're just pandering to your base. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=108.62s)]
*  You have to have an open dialogue. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=110.28s)]
*  You have to have it, especially in the form of debate, as we're on the precipice of a [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=111.66000000000001s)]
*  World War three, essentially because policies that Biden rolled back from Trump. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=114.74000000000001s)]
*  This is the perfect time for them to say whose policies were better. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=119.02000000000001s)]
*  Where would we be right now? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=122.58000000000001s)]
*  It is absolutely they need to have a debate. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=123.7s)]
*  But Joe Biden is going to save democracy. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMEjggFVCqM&t=125.94s)]
