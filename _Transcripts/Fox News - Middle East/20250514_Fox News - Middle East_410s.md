# Middle East must go 'all-in' on Trump to counter Iran, says Hannity
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU)
*  And welcome to Hannity and we are coming to you from Doha, Qatar. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=0.0s)]
*  It is nine o'clock on the East Coast, four a.m. here in Qatar. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=7.36s)]
*  And tonight we'll bring you part two of my exclusive interview with President Trump aboard [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=11.0s)]
*  Air Force One. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  We covered a ton of ground. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=16.54s)]
*  It went on for nearly 50 minutes. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=18.2s)]
*  All of that part two coming up. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=20.2s)]
*  You don't want to miss it. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  But first, another historic day for the United States of America. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=23.080000000000002s)]
*  President Trump began the day with more high level meetings in Saudi Arabia, including [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=27.66s)]
*  one with the president of Syria. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=32.1s)]
*  Trump urging him to normalize relations with Israel, just like he did Saudi Arabia, and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=34.58s)]
*  reject radicalism. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=40.14s)]
*  In return, President Trump is lifting U.S. sanctions on Syria to, quote, give them a [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=41.14s)]
*  chance at greatness. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=46.46s)]
*  Take a look for yourself. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  Among others and friends of mine, people that I have a lot of respect for in the Middle [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=49.58s)]
*  I will be ordering the cessation of sanctions against Syria in order to give them a chance [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=54.54s)]
*  at greatness. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=60.42s)]
*  Now before departing Saudi Arabia, President Trump also addressed the Gulf Cooperation [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=62.06s)]
*  Council where, and I was at this meeting, where he held the progress being made in the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=66.66s)]
*  region and painted an optimistic picture of lasting peace in one of the world's most volatile [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=71.14s)]
*  regions. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=76.74s)]
*  Take a look at this. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=77.74s)]
*  As I said in my address last night, the Gulf nations are at the forefront of creating a [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=78.78s)]
*  stable, peaceful, and prosperous Middle East. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=84.02s)]
*  And I have to say that I've seen such progress. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=87.94s)]
*  It's really incredible. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=91.74000000000001s)]
*  I've also seen great unity and friendships. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=93.62s)]
*  I've spent a little time with you just before this, and I've seen tremendous unity, tremendous [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=95.74000000000001s)]
*  friendship, and the whole world is watching the Middle East, and many are watching with [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=101.14s)]
*  envy. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=105.62s)]
*  You have something very special going on. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=106.78s)]
*  Incredible opportunities are within reach for this region. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=109.9s)]
*  If we can simply stop the aggression from a small group of pretty bad actors, I especially [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=113.46000000000001s)]
*  want to thank and congratulate the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain for their vision [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  and courage in signing the historic Abraham Accords. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=123.5s)]
*  I hope that in the near future we can continue that progress. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=128.8s)]
*  We have a mandate from the American people, the likes of which people haven't seen for [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=133.42s)]
*  129 years. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=137.05999999999997s)]
*  They say it was the most consequential election in America in 129 years. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=138.5s)]
*  Now the president even expressed a willingness to make a deal with Iran, but he issued a [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=145.22s)]
*  very strong warning demanding an end to Iran's proxy wars and their unyielding sponsorship [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=150.26s)]
*  of terror around the entire world, the number one state sponsor of terror. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=157.42s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=161.26s)]
*  I want to make a deal with Iran. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=162.73999999999998s)]
*  I want to do something if it's possible. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=164.29999999999998s)]
*  But for that to happen, it must stop sponsoring terror, halt its bloody proxy wars, and permanently [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=166.89999999999998s)]
*  and verifiably cease its pursuit of nuclear weapons. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=172.85999999999999s)]
*  They cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=176.62s)]
*  I don't imagine there's anybody at this table or anybody in this room that would say they [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=178.66s)]
*  can. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=182.66s)]
*  I'm strongly urging all nations to join us in fully and totally enforcing the sanctions [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=183.66s)]
*  that I just placed on Iran. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=189.45999999999998s)]
*  The president, he has been very clear over and over and over again that Iran will never [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=193.26s)]
*  have nuclear weapons or the enrichment of uranium. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=198.94s)]
*  That must stop. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=202.45999999999998s)]
*  He's been clear on that. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=203.45999999999998s)]
*  Everything must be verifiable. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=204.98s)]
*  He's also been clear. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=206.57999999999998s)]
*  Nobody wants military strikes. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=208.26s)]
*  Nobody. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=209.85999999999999s)]
*  However, the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism, coupled with their evil and [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=210.85999999999999s)]
*  extreme ideology, puts the entire region and world at risk. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=215.07999999999998s)]
*  So President Trump is being very clear that will not happen on his watch. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=220.16s)]
*  Now, make no mistake, there has been no bigger champion of peace in Europe, peace in the [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=224.07999999999998s)]
*  Middle East, than President Donald Trump. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=229.16s)]
*  Bottom line, a peaceful Middle East is good for America. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  It is good for the region where we are. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=235.24s)]
*  It is good for the entire world. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=237.16s)]
*  This is not just good for our national security, but also our economy will benefit greatly. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=239.24s)]
*  This brings to us some massive news from right here in Qatar earlier today. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=245.64s)]
*  The red carpet, you can see it by the way, rolled out for President Trump's arrival following [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=251.27999999999997s)]
*  Saudi Arabia's show of solidarity with the U.S. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=255.88s)]
*  Qatar sent its own fighter jets up to escort Air Force One to its landing. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=258.91999999999996s)]
*  By the way, what you're seeing there, I was able to film some incredible sights. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=263.56s)]
*  And on the ground, in an incredible display from Qatar, President Trump's motorcade was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=268.08s)]
*  escorted in part, you see there? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=272.44s)]
*  By Tesla's cyber trucks. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=275.36s)]
*  Anyway, just as they did yesterday in Riyadh, American flags were lining the streets of [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=277.0s)]
*  Doha as President Trump made his way to a meeting with the leader of Qatar right here. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=282.04s)]
*  Where, by the way, he did continue to deliver more victories for America and the American [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  people, adding on to yesterday's $600 billion commitment from the Saudis yesterday with [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=293.92s)]
*  to go up to a trillion dollars, including nearly $150 billion purchased in weaponry. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=301.32s)]
*  This trip could yield well over a trillion dollars in the coming months. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=308.8s)]
*  That means high paying career jobs for the American people. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=312.96s)]
*  And we are now nearing the $10 trillion in monies committed towards American jobs and [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=317.56s)]
*  manufacturing of things like, oh, that are important, semiconductor chips, pharmaceuticals [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=323.88s)]
*  that will manufacture in America, automobiles will manufacture in America. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=328.96s)]
*  President Trump, he signed a series of economic and defense agreements with the emir of Qatar, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=333.32s)]
*  including an agreement from Qatar Airways to purchase Boeing jets, which, according [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=338.91999999999996s)]
*  to President Trump, would include 160 Boeing jets. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=343.32s)]
*  That's worth up to $200 billion. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=348.0s)]
*  All told, the White House says today's agreements will generate more than $1 trillion in economic [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=350.28s)]
*  exchange between the U.S. and Qatar, bringing the total from this trip so far to trillions [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  of dollars in investments. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=362.76000000000005s)]
*  Over the first two days of the trip, President Trump has delivered one victory after another [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=364.56s)]
*  after another. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  We wouldn't know it from the legacy media mob, while simultaneously outlining a vision [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=369.84000000000003s)]
*  for a brighter future for the Middle East, a safer world, a better America. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=374.56s)]
*  And it is now more abundantly clear than ever. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=379.56s)]
*  In order to counter Iran, the Middle East has to go all in on Donald Trump and the United [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=383.68s)]
*  States and buy into peace, reject radicalism, don't turn a blind eye to radicalism, embrace [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=389.56s)]
*  the relationship of this historic trip. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=saz4-h6X9tU&t=396.56s)]
