# Col. Richard Kemp: Israel is being 'restrained' by the Biden-Harris admin
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 16, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM)
*  In Tel Aviv, Israel, my dear friend Colonel Richard Kemp, former commander of British [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=0.0s)]
*  forces in Afghanistan, former chairman of the Cobra Intelligence Group. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=4.8s)]
*  Colonel Kemp, there you are. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=9.36s)]
*  You're in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=11.44s)]
*  You're in Israel. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=12.44s)]
*  What's the sense you get there, number one? [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=13.44s)]
*  And number two, I mean, with your experience, your background, you're a scholar, the whole [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=16.0s)]
*  deal, what do you make of this idea? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=21.92s)]
*  We bring in these massive forces, and they're diplomatically behind the scenes. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=24.78s)]
*  We're doing everything possible to tell the Israelis, stand down, stand down, don't [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=28.959999999999997s)]
*  defeat Hamas. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=32.92s)]
*  Missiles coming in from Hezbollah, Iran getting a nuclear weapon. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=34.72s)]
*  And it's Israel's fault, and it's Netanyahu's fault if they would only agree to a ceasefire, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=38.32s)]
*  if they would only agree to this, if they'd only back off. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  What's your sense of all this? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=45.32s)]
*  Yeah, I've been here in Israel for quite a long time now, several weeks since I arrived. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=46.32s)]
*  And my overall impression of the situation, as it is right now, is that the Israelis, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=54.64s)]
*  they know that they're in the crosshairs of Iran's threatened rocket attacks and drone [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=60.92s)]
*  attacks. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=66.2s)]
*  They're ready for it. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=67.2s)]
*  They're not afraid of it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=68.48s)]
*  They obviously don't want it, but they're not afraid of it. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=70.32s)]
*  I think the—I've been into Gaza recently. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  I've spoken to IDF soldiers in Gaza. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=76.52s)]
*  What they want to do is they want to keep fighting. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=79.44s)]
*  They are absolutely opposed to the idea that I think comes largely from the United States [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=81.92s)]
*  that Israel should not completely defeat Hamas, that they should pull out, they should allow [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=87.32s)]
*  Hamas to continue. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=92.22s)]
*  The IDF soldiers on the ground don't want that. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=93.88s)]
*  They want to fight on, despite the terrible conditions they're fighting in and despite [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=96.46s)]
*  the immense dangers they face. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=100.6s)]
*  So that's the broad position here, I think. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=102.64s)]
*  In terms of the situation, everybody's waiting for Iran to attack. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=105.68s)]
*  There are arguments that Israel should do a preemptive strike on Iran. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=112.46000000000001s)]
*  Iran has threatened Israel. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=117.0s)]
*  Israel should hit them first. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=118.16000000000001s)]
*  Now, I'm not going to tell Israel what it should and shouldn't do, because I don't [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=119.68s)]
*  have all the full facts, but that's certainly one option. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=123.64000000000001s)]
*  But meanwhile, the United States and other countries around the world, including the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  seems to me to be doing everything it can to prevent Israel from defeating Hamas and [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=132.16s)]
*  then retaliating against Iran, which, of course, is the controlling hand behind Hamas. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=139.23999999999998s)]
*  And of course, it's not just going on in Gaza. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=145.56s)]
*  It's also going up in the north. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=148.68s)]
*  There have been numerous rocket and drone attacks on northern Israel from another Iranian [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=149.92s)]
*  proxy, Hezbollah, up in Lebanon, who have forced, over the last 10 months, have forced [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=154.92s)]
*  something like 70,000, 80,000 people from northern Israel to leave their homes, leave [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=160.68s)]
*  their places of work and take shelter further into Israel. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=166.04000000000002s)]
*  So that's the kind of situation. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=169.88s)]
*  And faced with that, faced with a war on multiple fronts—and we're talking about seven different [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=172.36s)]
*  fronts, including the Houthis in Yemen, Iraq, Syria and others—Israel is expected to somehow [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=178.28s)]
*  agree to stand down, to basically surrender to Hamas. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=186.56s)]
*  And this current meeting that's going on at present in Qatar, which has been orchestrated [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=191.16000000000003s)]
*  by the U.S., which Hamas have said they will not attend, is designed to get Israel to stop [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=197.24s)]
*  fighting. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=203.52s)]
*  And that's a terrible tragedy. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=204.60000000000002s)]
*  The payback for it seems to be the possible release of a few of the hostages. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=208.44s)]
*  Not all of the hostages are being held, but some of them. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=214.6s)]
*  And Israel has got this real dilemma, I think, at the moment. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=216.72s)]
*  It knows it can fight and defeat Hamas. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=220.64s)]
*  It knows also that it can take the war into Lebanon, to Hezbollah, if it needs to. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=223.44s)]
*  And it knows it can strike a very powerful blow against Iran, yet is being restrained [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=227.76s)]
*  by almost every sinew from the Biden administration, the Biden-Harris administration, which seems [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=232.79999999999998s)]
*  to want Israel not to win. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7ZrG10AVYM&t=238.66s)]
