# How close is Iran to a nuclear weapon?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA)
*  For more on this, let's bring in the president of the Middle East Institute, Paul Salem. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=0.0s)]
*  He spent several years in the region and knows well the conflict going on. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=4.64s)]
*  Paul, thanks for being in the studio. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=8.6s)]
*  Thank you, Griff. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=10.32s)]
*  I want to pick up just where Jeff Paul's reporting left off, and we heard that sound bite from [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=11.32s)]
*  Iran saying, no damage was done, no damage was done whatsoever. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=15.64s)]
*  But yet, in this what appears to be a very limited strategic strike by Israel, striking [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=19.3s)]
*  which is, of course, the area where they house their most sensitive nuclear headquarters. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=26.28s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=32.84s)]
*  Well, I do think, and this is good news, that we've avoided a major escalation in the region. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=33.84s)]
*  I think a lot of credit for that goes to the United States, both its military defense as [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=38.28s)]
*  well as its active diplomacy, to urge Israel to have a measured and limited response to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=42.68000000000001s)]
*  the attack on Israel that happened the last weekend. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=48.68000000000001s)]
*  So I think we've avoided a pattern of major escalation, but we've entered a new period [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=52.44s)]
*  when both Iran and Israel feel free, in a sense, to attack their other countries' mainland [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=58.68s)]
*  directly. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=64.4s)]
*  And that poses serious questions for the future. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=65.84s)]
*  That's the Rubicon we've crossed, is that first Iran striking Israel directly, then [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=69.84s)]
*  the reverse happening. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=75.4s)]
*  And so my question to you, as someone who has spent your life and career studying this, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=77.75999999999999s)]
*  how significant is it that we've now crossed this threshold on the escalation ladder in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=82.44s)]
*  terms of threat? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=89.75999999999999s)]
*  What path are we on now, Paul? [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=91.08s)]
*  Well, first of all, the other conflict is continuing and might get worse, which is the [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=92.83999999999999s)]
*  war in Gaza and the war that Iran's friends or proxies, the militias around the region, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=97.28s)]
*  are conducting. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=102.8s)]
*  That is set to continue, and that is not de-escalating. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=103.8s)]
*  And I think we've bought a bit of a reprieve in terms of direct Israeli and Iranian attacks, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=106.54s)]
*  but as you say, we've crossed the Rubicon. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=111.30000000000001s)]
*  We're in a new period. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=113.42s)]
*  I think most immediately it will lead to a major arms race between Israel and Iran. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=114.7s)]
*  Israel will be receiving a lot of military aid from the U.S., the package that's now [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=119.82000000000001s)]
*  in the House. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=123.68s)]
*  I think the Iranian attack on Israel, while it was successfully defended against, it also [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=124.94000000000001s)]
*  demonstrated that if Iran really intended to cause major harm, it could have sent not [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=129.26s)]
*  but maybe 3,000 or 10,000, and that would have overwhelmed Israeli as well as American [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=136.22s)]
*  defenses. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=141.06s)]
*  And Israel demonstrated they can get into Iran any time they want. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=142.06s)]
*  And you really put your finger, Paul, on the concern of all the officials at the Pentagon [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=145.1s)]
*  and at the White House and here in the U.S. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=150.38s)]
*  And when you said if they really wanted to hurt them, because you heard just an hour [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=152.9s)]
*  or so before we got word of these strikes happening, the Iranian foreign minister, Amir [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=158.14s)]
*  Abdelahian, landed at the U.N. mission and went on another network, CNN, and said if [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=163.7s)]
*  Israel continues in their adventurous errors, however he put it, there would be a maximum [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=170.9s)]
*  level response that would be, quote, definitive, decisive and regretful to them. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=176.85999999999999s)]
*  And then overhanging all this is our intelligence that Iran's enriching uranium at about 60 [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=182.5s)]
*  percent. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=189.62s)]
*  They're getting close. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=190.62s)]
*  How concerned are you that we could see Iran? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=191.62s)]
*  Really threatening and possibly using a nuclear weapon? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=194.38s)]
*  Well, I think they'll be holding at this level for a long time. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=197.1s)]
*  I think they've always had breakout capacity. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=200.86s)]
*  If they really wanted to go for a bomb now or last year or next year, they certainly [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  can do it. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=207.34s)]
*  I don't see any major sea change in their thinking to say now is the time to go for [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=208.34s)]
*  it because that will have major consequences in the region and internationally. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=212.62s)]
*  So I think they'll hold. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=216.74s)]
*  What I think will happen is their alliance with Russia and their reliance on China will [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=218.28s)]
*  increase tenfold. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=222.70000000000002s)]
*  I think it's clear to them that they need a tremendous amount of air defense and air [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=224.5s)]
*  force and much of that will probably come from Russia so that worrisome alliance will [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=228.98000000000002s)]
*  get much worse. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=233.66000000000003s)]
*  We also should remember that this recent escalation happened when Israel attacked a compound in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=235.38000000000002s)]
*  Damascus. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=241.78s)]
*  What I mean to say by that is Iran and Israel have been going at it for decades now and [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=243.42000000000002s)]
*  years in Syria, but this was the first time from the Iranian perspective that they overstepped [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=249.02s)]
*  a certain line and hit what they considered embassy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=254.9s)]
*  So maybe they will be calm for a while. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=257.3s)]
*  To put it in context, Israel of course says that Iran, through their support of proxies [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=259.3s)]
*  and the Hamas horrific attack on October 7th, really set this latest escalation. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=263.82s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=269.26s)]
*  Paul Salem, thank you very much for being here. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=270.26s)]
*  We've run out of time. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=272.26s)]
*  We've got to leave it there. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=76hPMOIlhDA&t=273.26s)]
