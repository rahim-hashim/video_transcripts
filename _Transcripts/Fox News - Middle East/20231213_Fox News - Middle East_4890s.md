# Biden officials grilled on Iran's support of terrorism
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ)
*  Somebody who has been an integral part of our team here at the Oversight Subcommittee, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=0.0s)]

*  stuff too called the Senate. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=27.22s)]

*  We just want to say thank you for your service. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=53.42s)]
*  We know you're not going far. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=57.02s)]
*  I'm sure our paths will be crossing again. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=58.620000000000005s)]
*  Blessings and all the best to your future. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=63.06s)]
*  With that, I'm happy to acknowledge my colleague as well. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=65.78s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=68.3s)]
*  This is one of those moments of bipartisanship. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=70.42s)]
*  I'm honored to acknowledge the outstanding work and would wish her well as well. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=73.58s)]
*  Thank you, Rachel, for your service. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=80.86s)]
*  As a former staffer, I know you're only as good as the people you surround yourself with. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=82.68s)]
*  She's been excellent. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=89.76s)]
*  Thank you again. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=92.56s)]
*  With that, this hearing is entitled Moving the Money Part 2, Getting Answers from the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=94.4s)]
*  Biden Administration on the Iranian Regime's Support of Terrorism. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=98.72s)]
*  Without objection, all members will have five legislative days within which to submit extraneous [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=103.08000000000001s)]
*  materials to the chair for inclusion in the record. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=107.08000000000001s)]
*  I now recognize myself for five minutes to give an opening statement. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=110.64s)]
*  Assistant Secretary Rosenberg, Deputy Special Envoy Paley, thank you for appearing before [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  our subcommittee this morning. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=121.16s)]
*  Your testimony is significant to this subcommittee and continues to investigate how the Iranian [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=123.08s)]
*  regime accesses money around the world due to relapse sanction enforcement and waivers. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=129.56s)]
*  So additionally, we hope that you can shed light on why a new waiver was necessary for [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=135.56s)]
*  the Iraqi electricity sales and how the Biden Administration monitors compliance of sanctions [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=140.44s)]
*  around the world. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=146.52s)]
*  And as I said during our last hearing, I don't believe this topic should be partisan. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=147.76s)]
*  However, I do believe in accountability. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=152.2s)]
*  It is vital that our oversight work is informed with the collaboration and testimony directly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=155.07999999999998s)]
*  from agencies in an open and transparent setting, not behind closed doors. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=159.8s)]
*  So again, thank you for your willingness to be here today. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=164.44s)]
*  As we documented in our previous hearing, Iran continues to be a leading state sponsor [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=168.48s)]
*  of terrorism, facilitating wide range of attacks and other illicit activities around the globe. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  And we are seeing these reports daily regarding our own troops in the region. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=178.39999999999998s)]
*  October's attack on our ally Israel is a stark reminder that in order to prevent further [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=185.32s)]
*  atrocities, we must increase, not relax, pressure on the Iranian regime. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=189.83999999999997s)]
*  Iran sanctions have been a significant component of U.S. policy since Iran's 1979 Islamic Revolution. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=196.6s)]
*  And history tells us that they work. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=206.88s)]
*  For example, the previous administration's maximum pressure campaign cut oil exports [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=209.48s)]
*  from Iran, significantly reducing Tehran's ability to fund attacks against Americans [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=214.28s)]
*  and our allies. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=220.92s)]
*  In contrast, the current administration has adopted a different strategy. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=222.56s)]
*  This past September, as part of a deal with the Iranian regime to get American hostages, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=226.4s)]
*  President Biden waived U.S. sanctions to allow for the transfer of $6 billion of Iranian [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=231.12s)]
*  funds from accounts in South Korea to Qatar. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=236.20000000000002s)]
*  While the funds were only to be used for humanitarian purposes, such as food and medicine, there [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=240.60000000000002s)]
*  are reports that the Iranian regime has found and exploited ways around those restrictions. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=248.44000000000003s)]
*  Regardless of what the restrictions are placed on these transferred funds, Iranian officials [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=255.16s)]
*  themselves have signaled that this money is fungible, which is confirmed by the Iranian's [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=259.52s)]
*  president Ibrahim Raisi, who stated, quote, this money belongs to the Iranian people, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=264.6s)]
*  the Iranian government, so the Islamic Republic of Iran will decide what to do with this money, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=271.92s)]
*  close quote. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=277.36s)]
*  Believing that the money will go to benefit Iranian citizens may be a bit naive. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=278.36s)]
*  The White House and my colleagues on the other side of the aisle may attempt to dismiss the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=284.48s)]
*  significance of these waivers, assuring us that Iran will not gain access to these transferred funds. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=288.68s)]
*  The reality is they likely will at some point if they haven't already. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=295.64s)]
*  My colleagues will use this opportunity to point fingers at the past administration. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=301.12s)]
*  Instead of acknowledging that under this president, Iran has gained ground and grown in their influence. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=305.92s)]
*  I will note that the Obama administration, the Trump administration, all had been operating [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=311.71999999999997s)]
*  under this, but we saw a decrease in those sales, and that's what this whole program [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=317.56s)]
*  was about, to wean places like Korea off of Iranian oil. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=323.88s)]
*  The American people expect their representatives in Washington to stand up to those who wish [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=328.24s)]
*  us harm. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=332.7s)]
*  As we speak, Iranian proxies continue to attack American troops and our allies with little, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  if any, accountability or responsibility from this administration, in my opinion. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=340.0s)]
*  So as chair of this subcommittee, I intend to use Congress's oversight and authority [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=344.36s)]
*  to hold our government and the Biden administration accountable. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=348.59999999999997s)]
*  The status quo is not acceptable. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=352.2s)]
*  American lives have been lost. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=354.52s)]
*  There's been 66, 66 troops and contractors that have been killed in recent days. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=355.84s)]
*  And I look forward to having an open and honest dialogue this morning, and with that I'm going [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=363.24s)]
*  to yield back the balance of my time. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=369.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=371.8s)]
*  And the chair now recognizes the ranking member of the subcommittee on oversight, the gentleman [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=372.8s)]
*  from Texas, Mr. Green, for his requested four minutes for an opening statement. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=376.96s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=382.2s)]
*  I appreciate greatly your desire for accountability. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=383.2s)]
*  I respect greatly your desire to investigate fungibility. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=387.0s)]
*  I do believe that President Biden is an honorable man. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=393.2s)]
*  I believe that President Biden has followed the law. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=397.03999999999996s)]
*  I believe that what he has done for humanitarian purposes is something that other presidents [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=400.91999999999996s)]
*  have done in a similar way. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=408.03999999999996s)]
*  I believe that the $6 billion have not gone to, and I think we'll get evidence of that, [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=410.84s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=418.4s)]
*  The money would never go to Iran. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=419.4s)]
*  I think that this quest for accountability is something that we should pursue. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=423.28000000000003s)]
*  I don't think we should stop with just the second hearing, however. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=441.28000000000003s)]
*  I think we need a third hearing. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=445.48s)]
*  I think we need a third hearing because we need to take a look at the money that has [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=448.48s)]
*  gone to Hamas. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=455.16s)]
*  CNN news story. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=457.16s)]
*  In 2018, Qatar, Qatar is the same country that would aid and assist with the humanitarian [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=460.8s)]
*  support to the people in Iran. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=469.2s)]
*  In 2018, Qatar began making monthly payments to the Gaza Strip. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=473.64000000000004s)]
*  Some $15 million was sent into Gaza in cash-filled suitcases. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=479.76000000000005s)]
*  Cash-filled suitcases. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=486.84000000000003s)]
*  Now, this cash money going into the Gaza Strip, into the hands of Hamas. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=487.84000000000003s)]
*  This was delivered by the Qataris through Israeli territory after months of negotiation [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=498.44s)]
*  with Israel. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=505.28s)]
*  Now, what is interesting about this is, in doing this, $15 million, and by the way, when [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=506.84s)]
*  I say dollars, I literally mean dollars. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=513.28s)]
*  U.S. dollars, not Canadian dollars. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=516.76s)]
*  In doing this, the U.S. was aware of the Qatari payments, and this was on President Trump's [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=520.8s)]
*  watch to Hamas. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=527.88s)]
*  This is per a former senior State Department official. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=530.84s)]
*  And also, this allowed Prime Minister Netanyahu to avoid the pressure of peace talks because [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=535.08s)]
*  he could indirectly keep Hamas in power, and in so doing, he would have the perfect enemy, [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=548.96s)]

*  And as a result of not wanting Israel to exist, he could always say, I don't have a partner [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=566.0s)]
*  to negotiate with. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=571.1s)]
*  But while he's saying this, he is allowing millions in cash, we don't have to talk about [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=574.1999999999999s)]
*  fungibility, millions in cash to go directly to Hamas. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=584.0799999999999s)]
*  I think that we ought to investigate Mr. Trump's actions or the administration's actions. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=594.52s)]
*  I don't think we can limit these things to the lawful actions of President Biden. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=600.6800000000001s)]
*  This is more than probable cause to investigate. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=611.24s)]
*  I would hope, Mr. Chairman, that we would treat the Trump administration with similar [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=619.36s)]
*  desire to have accountability and find out what happened to that cash, suitcases of cash. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=627.5200000000001s)]
*  I yield back. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=632.8800000000001s)]
*  Gentlemen yield back. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=634.8800000000001s)]
*  I will note that I believe Ms. Rosenberg, and I'm not sure about Mr. Paley, but her [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=637.2800000000001s)]
*  career, employees, correct? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=642.7600000000001s)]
*  No, I had it reversed. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=645.7600000000001s)]
*  Mr. Paley is, so you may have that ability to ask them that. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=648.0s)]
*  The Chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, Ms. Waters, for a minute [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=652.08s)]
*  before an opening statement. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=657.2s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Green. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=663.2s)]
*  Under the Biden administration, the United States has maintained the most extensive set [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=666.24s)]
*  of comprehensive sanctions on Iran. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=671.0400000000001s)]
*  In fact, the Biden administration has ramped up pressure significantly since the Trump [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=674.24s)]
*  administration by designing sanctions for hundreds of additional entities for activity [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=679.36s)]
*  related to Iran, including illicit sale of Iranian oil. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=686.12s)]
*  Further, President Biden successfully negotiated a temporary ceasefire and the return of hostages [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=691.4s)]
*  taken by Hamas. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=699.16s)]
*  This is a kind of steady leadership that America needs in an increasingly unsteady world. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=701.0s)]
*  While I'm interested in working across the aisle with the administration to ratchet up [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=707.84s)]
*  pressure against Iran in any way possible, the accusations that the Biden administration [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=712.96s)]
*  has somehow weakened sanctions against Iran are simply false and are not conducive to [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=720.32s)]
*  productive conversation on these issues. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=727.12s)]
*  I hope we can clear up much of that misinformation, and I thank you and I yield back. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=730.48s)]
*  General, ladies, time has expired. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  So today we welcome the testimony of Elizabeth Rosenberg. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=740.64s)]
*  Assistant Secretary Rosenberg is the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=744.1999999999999s)]
*  Crimes. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=748.84s)]
*  Mr. Abraham Paley is the Deputy Special Envoy to Iran, and we want to thank you for taking [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=750.28s)]
*  the time to be here in person today. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=757.36s)]
*  And without objection, your written statements will be made as part of our permanent record. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=759.0s)]
*  So Assistant Secretary Rosenberg, you are now recognized for five minutes for your oral [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=764.16s)]
*  remarks. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=769.04s)]
*  Thank you, Chairman Hizenga, Ranking Member Green, and distinguished members of the committee. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=770.04s)]
*  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on what the U.S. Department of the Treasury is doing [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=775.8s)]
*  to combat terrorist financing. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=780.1999999999999s)]
*  October 7th was a day of horror. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=782.8s)]
*  The brutality of the terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas against Israel, killing indiscriminately, [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=785.4s)]
*  sparing neither children nor the elderly, was an affront to our shared humanity and [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=791.5999999999999s)]
*  a somber reminder of the threat posed by terrorist organizations like Hamas. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=796.84s)]
*  It is my responsibility as the Assistant Secretary for Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=801.0s)]
*  to identify and disrupt terrorist financing in the United States and abroad. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=806.8000000000001s)]
*  Since the attacks, Treasury has redoubled its effort to identify and freeze the finances [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=811.8000000000001s)]
*  of Hamas and other Iran-backed terrorist groups. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=816.6800000000001s)]
*  Hamas has traditionally been able to raise funds for its terrorist activities from an [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=820.36s)]
*  array of sources, including taxation, donations, a portfolio of investments across Africa and [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=824.4s)]
*  the Middle East, and direct support from Iran. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=831.4s)]
*  The U.S. Treasury Department has historically used the full scope of its authorities to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=835.0s)]
*  impede Hamas' funding. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=839.62s)]
*  Sanctions designations of the group's leaders and investments span over two decades. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=842.2s)]
*  Recognizing the dangerous role that Iran plays in destabilizing the region more broadly, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=847.96s)]
*  Treasury has sanctioned nearly 1,000 individuals and entities connected to the Iranian regime [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=852.8s)]
*  and its proxies to date. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=857.3199999999999s)]
*  Since the October attacks, Treasury has released three separate sanctions tranches focused [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=859.52s)]
*  on Hamas, designating over 50 additional individuals and entities linked to Hamas in Iran across [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=865.56s)]
*  multiple jurisdictions. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=871.48s)]
*  And today, just this morning, Treasury has announced another tranche of sanctions on [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=873.3199999999999s)]
*  Hamas entities in connection with international partners. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=878.6800000000001s)]
*  However, Hamas leaders live and move freely in Turkey, Qatar, and elsewhere, publicly [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=882.28s)]
*  solicit funds and enjoy financial services. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=889.28s)]
*  Therefore, in addition to sanctions designations, disrupting Hamas' international financial [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=892.44s)]
*  networks requires international action. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=898.16s)]
*  In the wake of the Hamas attacks, Treasury reached out to counterparts across the Middle [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=902.08s)]
*  East and Europe to convey the administration's support for Israel and the intent to use all [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=905.8000000000001s)]
*  the tools at our disposal to expose and disrupt Hamas, including the terrorist financing targeting [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=911.6s)]
*  center, which we promptly convened among a number of Gulf partners in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=917.44s)]
*  in October. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=923.0s)]
*  Additionally, Treasury Under Secretary Nelson recently traveled to Turkey to discuss the [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=924.48s)]
*  urgent need for Turkish efforts to freeze Hamas funds. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=929.88s)]
*  Secretary Adyemo also spoke with his European counterparts in late October to press partners [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=934.28s)]
*  to investigate entities with possible ties to Hamas. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=939.8399999999999s)]
*  Treasury has also had substantive technical outreach to our partners around the world, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=943.76s)]
*  which has led to complementary sanctions actions by Australia, the European Union, Japan, United [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  Kingdom, and others to designate Hamas-related targets through their own domestic authorities. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=954.4399999999999s)]
*  Treasury has also engaged the private sector, both in the United States and abroad, to refine [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=961.5999999999999s)]
*  the red flags and indicators of terrorist financing and underscore the imperative to [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=966.1199999999999s)]
*  report and freeze terrorist funds. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=971.64s)]
*  Alongside these counter-illicit finance activities, Treasury has a significant role to play in [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=975.28s)]
*  addressing the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Gaza to ensure that our financial measures [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=979.4s)]
*  do not negatively impact legitimate aid going to the people of Gaza. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=985.16s)]
*  Treasury has had close engagement with representatives of non-governmental organizations, international [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=990.04s)]
*  organizations, and U.S. government implementers of humanitarian assistance on these matters. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=995.28s)]
*  In sum, Treasury's response to Hamas and its funders over decades has been broad and aggressive. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1001.16s)]
*  As this committee fully appreciates, Hamas' attacks and their relationship with Iran pose [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1008.8s)]
*  a threat to the safety and stability not only of Israel but to the region more broadly and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1014.0799999999999s)]
*  to American interests. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1018.7s)]
*  All of us here share a common interest, preventing acts of terror. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1020.9s)]
*  Secretary Yellen and Deputy Secretary Adyemo have previously spoken about how to confront [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1026.1s)]
*  these challenges by maintaining U.S. leadership abroad, meeting all our financial commitments, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1029.78s)]
*  and adapting our laws to meet the challenges posed by new and emerging financial technologies. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1036.14s)]
*  I look forward to working with the members of this committee on these issues, and I'd [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1041.26s)]
*  be happy to answer your questions. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1044.94s)]

*  Our bolstered presence in the region has sent a clear message that this is not a time to [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1155.52s)]
*  take advantage of the situation. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1160.24s)]
*  And President Biden has shown he is prepared to defend U.S. personnel and interests time [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1162.22s)]
*  and time again. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1167.06s)]
*  While our priority right now remains supporting Israel, countering Iran's support for terrorism [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1168.78s)]
*  in the region, and addressing the humanitarian situation in Gaza, we also continue to counter [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1173.94s)]
*  the full range of the Iranian regime's activities that are antithetical to our interests and [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1178.94s)]
*  our values. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1184.1000000000001s)]
*  We are confronting the Iranian regime's lethal plotting against current and former U.S. officials, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1185.32s)]
*  as well as the transnational repression of dissidents, journalists, and human rights [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1190.46s)]
*  defenders, including on U.S. soil. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1194.66s)]
*  We are using all of the tools at our disposal to expose and disrupt Iran's expanding military [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1197.3000000000002s)]
*  partnership with Russia, alongside our allies and partners. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1202.3000000000002s)]
*  We are standing with the people of Iran in the face of continued oppression and violence, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  and on the nuclear front, President Biden is absolutely committed to never allowing [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1211.38s)]
*  Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon, and has been clear that we remain postured and prepared [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1215.5s)]
*  to use all appropriate measures to do so. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1220.58s)]
*  Iran's unjust detention of our citizens for political leverage also represents a threat, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1223.86s)]
*  and that is why we continue to stress to all Americans, do not go to Iran. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1228.74s)]
*  President Biden and Secretary Blinken have been clear there is no higher priority than [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1234.34s)]
*  the safety and security of Americans, and the administration stands by our deal that [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1238.42s)]
*  brought five innocent Americans and two of their family members home. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1242.66s)]
*  This deal was about reuniting these Americans with their loved ones. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1246.88s)]
*  As part of this arrangement, we facilitated the transfer of $6 billion in restricted Iranian [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1250.9s)]
*  funds held in South Korea to restricted accounts and cutter for humanitarian use only. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1256.3600000000001s)]
*  Not a penny of this money has been spent, and these funds will not go anywhere anytime [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1263.02s)]
*  soon. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1267.94s)]
*  This does not change anything about our approach to Iran. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1268.94s)]
*  Iran remains an adversary, and we will continue to confront it as such. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1272.46s)]
*  With respect to Qatar, its relationship with Hamas has been well known to multiple Israeli [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1277.38s)]
*  governments, including the current government going back many years. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1282.5s)]
*  It has been and remains extremely helpful in securing hostage releases. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1286.42s)]
*  At the same time, we have discussed with Qatari leaders that there is no going back to the [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1291.6000000000001s)]
*  status quo of October 6, and they have expressed their agreement with that. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1295.08s)]
*  With respect to the waiver Secretary Blinken signed on November 14, the 21st such waiver [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1299.88s)]
*  across multiple administrations for Iraq to pay for electricity imports and in support [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1304.9s)]
*  of Iraq's energy independence. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1310.16s)]
*  Under these waivers, no money has been or will be permitted to enter Iran, and any notion [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1312.5800000000002s)]
*  to the contrary is false. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1318.0400000000002s)]
*  These Iranian funds can only be used for the purchase of food, agricultural commodities, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1319.8000000000002s)]
*  medical devices, and other non-sanctionable transactions. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1326.64s)]
*  We do not believe that restricting the availability of humanitarian goods to the Iranian people [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1330.3600000000001s)]
*  would decrease Iran's support for terrorism. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1334.8000000000002s)]
*  Iran has proven it prioritizes destabilizing activities and terrorism regardless of the [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1337.6000000000001s)]
*  country's macroeconomic conditions, and since we do not expect any change in Iran's behavior [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1342.72s)]
*  from these steps, our approach to Iran is similarly not going to change. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1347.2800000000002s)]
*  And so I close by reaffirming the administration's commitment to addressing Iran's continued [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1351.0600000000002s)]
*  destabilizing behavior unilaterally and with our partners. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1355.8799999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1359.52s)]
*  Thank you for that. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1363.32s)]
*  And before I get into my questions, I want to emphasize as well the U.S. citizens that [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1365.24s)]
*  still go to Iran is stunning to me. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1370.8s)]
*  Recently I had the Swiss ambassador to Iran in my office. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1375.24s)]
*  She and the Swiss act as our on-the-ground liaison since we do not have diplomatic relations. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1379.72s)]
*  They know of tens of thousands of our citizens who are there, and they suspect that it may [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1386.84s)]
*  be more. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1394.98s)]
*  So if anything, if we want to talk about bipartisan agreement, please do not go to Iran. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1396.08s)]
*  And so we, the government, and we as citizens aren't ever put in that situation. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1403.32s)]
*  So I wanted to emphasize that is a public service announcement from the oversight committee. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1409.44s)]
*  That's okay with the ranking members. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1414.72s)]
*  So I'm going to start with my questions with Assistant Secretary Rosenberg. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1416.52s)]
*  What is the Biden administration's policy reason for allowing the transfer of money [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1422.96s)]
*  from Iraqi banks to Iraqi Dinar, in Iraqi Dinar, to France, Germany, Italy, and Oman? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1427.6000000000001s)]
*  The last two waivers covered those. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1436.0s)]
*  And to be then converted from Dinar to Euros. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1439.24s)]
*  Basically, what I'm wanting to know is the why. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1442.0s)]
*  And then secondarily, who requested this move? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1445.52s)]
*  So the secretary. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1448.52s)]
*  Thank you very much for the question. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1449.52s)]
*  I appreciate the opportunity to speak to this. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1453.64s)]
*  As a point of clarification, the money was earned in Euros. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1457.4s)]
*  So it never changed. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1461.5s)]
*  There was never an FX transaction. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1463.24s)]
*  It was earned in Euros. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1464.6000000000001s)]
*  What do you mean by earned in Euros? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1466.92s)]
*  I mean, this was electricity that was sent from Iran to Iraq. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1468.8s)]
*  The Iraqis paid for it in Euros? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1474.24s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1476.96s)]
*  So it was never in Iraqi Dinar? [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1478.1599999999999s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1480.12s)]
*  Okay. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1481.12s)]
*  And that's my understanding, though, that the law says that it is meant and intended [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1482.12s)]
*  to be in the local denomination. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1484.56s)]
*  I will defer to my colleague from the State Department to discuss the waivers that were [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1487.6s)]
*  put in place originally by the last administration that allow for Iraq to purchase energy from [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1495.52s)]
*  Iran. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1503.28s)]
*  So they haven't been converted to Euros because they were in Euros is your testimony? [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1504.28s)]
*  Yes. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1508.32s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1509.32s)]
*  Why is that necessary? [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1510.32s)]
*  It's necessary. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1514.08s)]
*  The Iraqis have the opportunity to pay for that in either Dinar or Euros, and they pay [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1517.08s)]
*  for it in Euros. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1522.72s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1524.1200000000001s)]
*  As we've discussed, Oman is one of the countries. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1525.6000000000001s)]
*  So the money that's whether it's in Italy, France, or was in Germany, or is in Oman is [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1527.64s)]
*  in Euros is your understanding? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1532.44s)]
*  It's in Euros. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1535.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1536.16s)]
*  Why is Oman one of the countries granted a waiver to receive Iranian funds from Iraq? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1537.28s)]
*  Why Oman? [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1542.56s)]
*  We have worked with the financial institutions in Oman to create the structure for restrictions [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1544.68s)]
*  on these finances. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1552.52s)]
*  Do you have greater confidence in the Omani banking system than you do in the Qatari banking [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1553.52s)]
*  system or the Italian banking system or the French banking system? [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1558.24s)]
*  Speaking specifically to the funds in question, I think that we're here today to discuss. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1563.56s)]
*  So funds in Qatar and funds in Oman. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1568.0s)]
*  We've worked very carefully with- [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1572.2s)]
*  But the waiver says Italy and France, France twice, the last two waivers, and Germany. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1574.44s)]
*  I'm curious why Germany is no longer in that waiver and maybe Mr. Paley is going to have [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1579.96s)]
*  to answer that, but I want to continue with you. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1583.4s)]
*  I'd happily defer- these are State Department waivers, so I'd happily defer to my colleague [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1585.32s)]
*  to speak to the text of the waiver. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1589.64s)]
*  Okay. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1592.0s)]
*  But with respect to the confidence that we have in the financial institutions in Qatar [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1593.0s)]
*  and in Oman that hold this money, we've worked on creating a structure for the restriction [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1598.16s)]
*  of these funds and a whole series of levels of compliance in order to examine the money [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1604.2s)]
*  and any potential requests for- [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1611.28s)]
*  We had testimony previously that there's no written agreement on that. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1613.3600000000001s)]
*  There is no letter, or there is a letter, but not a written agreement. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1617.16s)]
*  But have there been any humanitarian transactions facilitated from the Iranian funds held in [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1621.0400000000002s)]
*  Oman? [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1626.2s)]
*  There have been two transactions. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1627.2s)]
*  Two transactions, okay. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1628.68s)]
*  I know Mr. Paley had said there had been none out of Qatar, but there have been out of Oman. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1630.0s)]
*  Have there been any issues or problems identified in the transactions facilitated from the Iranian [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1635.8s)]
*  funds held in Oman? [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1640.76s)]
*  I'm familiar with the request from the Chair regarding some matters related to the financial [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1642.48s)]
*  institutions. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1648.92s)]
*  We have prepared a response to that, and that will be forthcoming, I believe, today. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1650.16s)]
*  It would be inappropriate for me to speak in an open setting here about the financial [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1655.48s)]
*  institutions in detail, although we'd be happy to, in a closed setting, speak more about [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1659.6799999999998s)]
*  that particular matter. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1664.28s)]
*  So this is yes or no. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1665.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, you're not giving us any information. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1667.24s)]
*  Have there been problems or issues with those transfers? [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1670.28s)]
*  The transactions themselves? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1676.6399999999999s)]
*  We have confidence in the series of restrictions that we have in place and the due diligence [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1678.64s)]
*  around the request. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1685.0s)]
*  Okay, Ms. Rosenberg, you're sliding into bureaucrat speak now. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1686.0s)]
*  I mean, you're going soft around the edges on this. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1689.48s)]
*  It's a simple question. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1694.72s)]
*  Your answer can be what I interpret is, I can't answer it in this open setting, but [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1696.24s)]
*  have there been problems? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1702.3200000000002s)]
*  I appreciate the question, and we would be happy to, in a closed setting, speak to you [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1704.24s)]
*  more about the particular transactions. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1708.56s)]
*  So we will take that as a yes. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1711.1200000000001s)]
*  And all right, so my time has expired. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1713.68s)]
*  With that, I'm going to recognize, at the request of the ranking member of the subcommittee, [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1717.1200000000001s)]
*  the full committee ranking member, the gentlewoman from California. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1721.64s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Pally and Ms. Rosenberg. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1725.6s)]
*  The United States had a long-standing bipartisan policy to explicitly exclude certain humanitarian [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1730.36s)]
*  activities from sanctions restrictions. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1738.32s)]
*  Specifically, humanitarian acceptance allowed for trade in agricultural commodities, medicine, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1741.56s)]
*  and medical devices. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1749.0s)]
*  Such exceptions are reflected in legislation and executive orders that form the United [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1751.0s)]
*  States sanctions programs, including those related to Iran. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1758.3999999999999s)]
*  These humanitarian exceptions reflect basic respect for all human life, and they are also [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1763.6s)]
*  important to our broader national security interests. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1770.6799999999998s)]
*  Right now, there's a very serious humanitarian crisis occurring in Gaza, and although the [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1774.48s)]
*  Biden administration was able to successfully negotiate a temporary ceasefire to allow for [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1780.76s)]
*  more humanitarian assistance, much more is needed. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1788.12s)]
*  Mr. Pally, Ms. Rosenberg, can you discuss the importance of humanitarian exceptions [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1791.68s)]
*  in the context of what is happening in Gaza and U.S. strategic interests in the broader [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1797.44s)]
*  region? [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1802.76s)]
*  What would an elimination of humanitarian exceptions to sanctions and what that would [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1803.9199999999998s)]
*  mean for the innocent civilians in Gaza? [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1810.6s)]
*  Thank you very much for the question. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1818.12s)]
*  It is correct that the ability to, the exceptions that exist to pay for agricultural commodities, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1820.32s)]
*  medical devices, and medicine are a matter of long-standing policy. [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1829.76s)]
*  They are enshrined in congressional statute over years, over many programs, over successive [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1833.76s)]
*  Congresses. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1841.24s)]
*  They are enshrined in executive authority as well, over a variety of administrations. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1842.24s)]
*  As you say, it reflects respect for human life. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1848.3999999999999s)]
*  It respects core values of Congress, of the administration about providing for meeting [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1852.08s)]
*  basic human needs. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1858.6399999999999s)]
*  These exceptions that exist, the ability to pay for humanitarian goods, apply across an [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1860.6799999999998s)]
*  array of sanctions programs. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1867.1599999999999s)]
*  And so to the extent that there's a, where there is a need, so for example you were noting [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1869.0s)]
*  in Gaza, our exceptions exist there as well, which is to say that sanctions should not [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1874.36s)]
*  be, and we will work so that they cannot be here, restrictions on the provision of humanitarian [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1880.56s)]
*  assistance there as elsewhere. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1886.28s)]
*  One note I would add, given that we're here to discuss Iran and its support for terror, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1889.12s)]
*  including through proxy groups in the region, and our concern about the potential for diversion [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1896.8799999999999s)]
*  of humanitarian aid, it creates the necessity for us to work diligently to ensure that humanitarian [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1901.12s)]
*  aid is in a number of circumstances restricted, and we have great clarity on the fact that [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1908.12s)]
*  it should be used for humanitarian aid and not diverted. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1913.24s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Payne. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1917.28s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1921.42s)]
*  I would reiterate what Assistant Secretary Rosenberg said in terms of this administration's [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1922.42s)]
*  commitment of support on humanitarian issues, which echoes support across multiple administrations [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1927.72s)]
*  for addressing humanitarian issues and also having these humanitarian carve-outs in our [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1935.72s)]
*  legislation that allow for, with the proper due diligence, humanitarian transaction to [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1942.72s)]
*  go to people across the world, including in areas where we have very strong disagreements [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1948.68s)]
*  about their policy approaches. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1957.16s)]
*  Since October 7th, President Biden and Secretary Blinken have emphasized their support for [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1959.76s)]
*  Israel and Israel's right to defend themselves, including against Iranian-backed terrorism. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1966.24s)]
*  At the same time, President Biden and Secretary Blinken have also emphasized their focus on [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1972.6s)]
*  humanitarian support to Gaza. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1978.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1980.94s)]
*  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle have alleged that President Biden has weakened [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1982.86s)]
*  sanctions, but my understanding is that President Biden has only increased sanctions since the [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1986.8000000000002s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1991.6000000000001s)]
*  In fact, the two transactions waivers that are the focus of this hearing are actually [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1993.0800000000002s)]
*  carried over from the Trump administration. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=1999.52s)]
*  Can you please confirm that these are the same sanctions waivers from the Trump administration [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2002.3600000000001s)]
*  that have been continued by the Biden administration? [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2008.52s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2010.96s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2014.3200000000002s)]
*  Yes, in terms of the waiver with regards to Iraq and Iraq's purchases of electricity [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2015.32s)]
*  from Iran, this is the 21st time that this waiver has been issued, the 20th renewal across [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2023.52s)]
*  administrations. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2031.52s)]
*  This administration has been very clear about our support for Iraq, and that's what this [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2033.3999999999999s)]
*  waiver is about. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2038.28s)]
*  I'm happy to get into more detail. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2039.28s)]
*  As Ms. Rosenberg said, our support for... [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2042.32s)]
*  I'll let you finish the sentence, but the gentlelady's time has expired. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2044.88s)]
*  Okay, thank you very much. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2049.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2050.88s)]
*  With that, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Sessions, is recognized for five minutes. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2051.88s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, thank you very much. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2054.88s)]
*  What's happening today is that this subcommittee under the leadership of our young chairman [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2064.72s)]
*  is trying to ask questions because, as you know, as required by law, there's a report [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2070.88s)]
*  that was issued to Congress. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2078.2000000000003s)]
*  There was only one sentence in the report regarding the payment transfer of authority [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2079.92s)]
*  in the most recent November Iraqi electric waiver. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2085.1200000000003s)]
*  So I've got a copy of your statement here, and the statement says the secretary also [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2090.76s)]
*  certifies that France, Italy, and Oman faced exceptional circumstances, exceptional circumstances [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2097.68s)]
*  preventing them from significantly reducing their petroleum products purchases from Iran. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2105.92s)]
*  Well, look, I get it with France, but Italy has reserves of 1.3% of what it already uses. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2115.36s)]
*  I don't know what the exceptional and significant is there. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2123.36s)]
*  Oman has proven reserves of 79.4 times its annual consumption, and yet this secretary [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2130.8s)]
*  has chosen to fool the United States Congress into believing significant and exceptional [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2142.6s)]
*  rather than providing the data and information. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2150.6s)]
*  So the problem is that we've been around for a while, and remember that the Obama administration, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2155.6s)]
*  five different times, argued the case they could only give Iran cash, billions of dollars, [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2165.6s)]
*  and the only way they could do it is in cash. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2173.6s)]
*  Well, we know that you can't follow the cash. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2178.6s)]
*  We don't know where that went. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2183.04s)]
*  The Obama administration argued, oh, but we're for the Israelis, but kept giving billions [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2186.04s)]
*  of dollars to cash. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2194.64s)]
*  Hamas only makes, has about $500 million a year, and yet these administrations from, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2196.68s)]
*  granted, the Democratic side give billions of dollars cash to the Iranians, where it's [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2206.12s)]
*  just slush money. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2217.6s)]
*  Just go give it out. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2219.9199999999996s)]
*  There's no way to follow the money. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2221.04s)]
*  Mr. Paley, there was no explanation in this report as to why it necessitated the payment [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2225.4s)]
*  transfers. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2233.0s)]
*  I gave you two minutes. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2234.0s)]
*  Gentlemen, I'd like for him to answer the question of what should have been in here [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2236.48s)]
*  in this report. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2242.2400000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Congressman, and thank you for the opportunity to discuss this [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2245.2400000000002s)]
*  with me. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2249.44s)]
*  I'm sure you're delighted with it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2249.48s)]
*  We welcome the opportunity, because at the heart of it, what this waiver is about is [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2252.44s)]
*  our support for Iraq. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2256.6s)]
*  Across administrations, we have issued and renewed these waivers. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2258.88s)]
*  Then why did you blame Oman in exceptional circumstances and significant? [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2262.8s)]
*  Why did you use those terms for someone that has 79 times what their annual needs are? [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2270.96s)]
*  Thanks very much for the question. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2279.28s)]
*  Over time, multiple administrations have approved and renewed these waivers to allow Iraq to [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2280.6s)]
*  continue to purchase electricity from Iran. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2285.88s)]
*  Over time, money has accrued in these accounts that are in Iraq and that are subject to all [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2289.04s)]
*  of the restrictions that have remained in place, because we have not lifted any sanctions [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2295.72s)]
*  against Iran. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2300.2999999999997s)]
*  Over time, as this money has accrued, Iran has sought to use this as a point of leverage [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2301.92s)]
*  over Iraq and pressured Iraq to release this money, to give it back in certain ways, and [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2308.16s)]
*  Iraq has stood firm. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2315.8799999999997s)]
*  We, with this waiver and with the previous waiver, have sought to stand firm with Iraq [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2318.04s)]
*  as it continues to improve its energy independence, but work with Iraq to get these Iranian funds [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2323.52s)]
*  out of the restricted accounts in Iraq, where Iran is able to leverage Iraq to release this [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2331.4s)]
*  money or transfer it in a way that would potentially not be subject to all of the restrictions [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2339.32s)]
*  that are in place. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2345.32s)]
*  Mr. Paley, I think your use of terms and hiding, in my opinion, behind this need for humanitarian [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2346.32s)]
*  and to support Iraq and all these things, we are dealing with America's greatest terror, [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2354.32s)]
*  and that is the Iranians, and you're giving them cash. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2363.0s)]
*  Mr. Chairman, I yield back my time. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2366.6800000000003s)]
*  Thank you. The gentleman's time has expired. With that, the gentlewoman from Texas, Ms. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2368.76s)]
*  Garcia, is recognized for five minutes. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2373.6800000000003s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the witness's presence today. I echo many [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2377.44s)]
*  of the comments made by some of my colleagues in condemning the rise of anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2384.2400000000002s)]
*  and the hate in all forms here in the United States and abroad. Everyone in this room and [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2391.76s)]
*  across the world saw the gruesome images and heard the heartbreaking stories of those impacted [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2397.08s)]
*  by the October 7th attack on Israel by Hamas. Attacks like these reinforce that the United [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2402.56s)]
*  States must maintain its steady global leadership abroad and is only strengthened during the [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2408.6s)]
*  Biden administration. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2415.6s)]
*  Terrorist groups like Hamas and Hezbollah are financed by Iran. There's no question [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2417.72s)]
*  about that, making U.S. sanctions on Iran critically important. We heard testimony today [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2421.68s)]
*  that places focus on two sanctions waivers granted by the United States earlier this [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2427.8999999999996s)]
*  year. So I want to inquire specifically further about the $6 billion in Iranian funds transferred [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2432.7799999999997s)]
*  from South Korean banks to Qatar. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2439.58s)]
*  Ms. Rosenberg, Secretary Wally, Eddie Yemo, told Congress that the U.S. and Qatar have [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2442.2999999999997s)]
*  agreed to effectively block the funds and that on a case-by-case applications, the U.S. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2450.18s)]
*  money would be spent under the current arrangement will be denied for foreseeable future. Could [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2457.8599999999997s)]
*  you provide specific examples of oversight mechanisms in place where the humanitarian [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2463.3399999999997s)]
*  channels are in place to prevent any funds from being used for terrorist financing? I [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2468.8999999999996s)]
*  know that I think Mr. Wally said that not one penny has been spent. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2474.8999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for the question. It is the case that there have been no transfers out of the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2479.8999999999996s)]
*  $6 billion sum held in Qatari financial institutions. So I'll offer an explanation of the measures [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2487.66s)]
*  in place to prevent the diversion to non-humanitarian purposes. There's three levels of controls [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2498.1s)]
*  on this restricted fund. So in the first instance, the financial institutions themselves apply [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2508.2599999999998s)]
*  their own know your customer and due diligence requirements for the funds. In certain instances, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2514.34s)]
*  they have adopted a policy to pre-vet potential recipients of funds. These would be firms [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2522.7000000000003s)]
*  engaged in agricultural activity, medicine, and medical device supply companies, for example. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2530.94s)]
*  So these firms, the financial institutions have also adopted a policy of only letting [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2538.94s)]
*  existing account holders be in the position to receive the funds, which is to say those [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2548.38s)]
*  that have already been onboarded and vetted for customer awareness. So that's one level, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2554.3s)]
*  is the intensive and enhanced due diligence at the financial institutions. On top of that [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2560.54s)]
*  comes the restrictions from the European Union. So these are the kinds of controls, know your [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2567.02s)]
*  customer and anti-money laundering controls, incumbent upon institutions that operate within [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2577.82s)]
*  the EU. This is because, as noted previously in questions with the chair, the funds are [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2584.86s)]
*  in euros, which means that there's a necessity to, when clearing euro transactions, be in [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2591.5s)]
*  line with European policies on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2600.14s)]
*  terrorism. So a second layer of controls has to do with European standards. A third level [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2605.62s)]
*  of controls has to do with the United States and the restrictions that we and the Treasury [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2611.18s)]
*  Department places on these accounts, on these restricted funds. I will note that there's [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2616.82s)]
*  no US nexus to these funds, nor has there been at any point. Nevertheless, we have imposed [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2621.78s)]
*  our own restrictions on these accounts in these institutions, in these cuttary institutions, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2628.2200000000003s)]
*  and this involves our own anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2636.06s)]
*  restrictions. It requires the financial institutions to notify the US Treasury Department whenever [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2641.7799999999997s)]
*  they seek to engage in any transfer. And back to your original point, no transfers have [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2647.42s)]
*  so far occurred. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2652.98s)]
*  No transfers have occurred. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2654.58s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2656.18s)]
*  And Mr. Paylor, you concur or have anything to add to Ms. Rosenberg's response? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2657.42s)]
*  I concur with her response, thank you. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2664.98s)]
*  All right, and you said earlier that not one penny has been spent. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2666.66s)]
*  That's correct. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2672.7s)]
*  Not one penny. [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2673.7s)]
*  Correct. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2674.7s)]
*  I think it's worth repeating because that seems to be a point that some don't seem to [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2675.7s)]
*  hear and I want to make sure that the public heard that not one penny has been spent. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2681.3799999999997s)]
*  Exactly, not one penny has been spent. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2686.3399999999997s)]
*  All right, well thank you and I see my time's running out, I yield back. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2688.46s)]
*  General ladies, time has expired with that. The Vice Chairman of the Committee, Mr. Rose [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2692.5400000000004s)]
*  from Tennessee, is acknowledged for five minutes. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2696.6600000000003s)]
*  Thank you Chairman and thank you to our witnesses for being with us today. Mr. Paley, how has [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2700.34s)]
*  the placing of US Special Envoy to Iran Robert Malley on unpaid leave affected your office's [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2707.82s)]
*  ability to effectively function? [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2715.5400000000004s)]
*  Thanks very much for the question. So as the Deputy Special Envoy for Iran at the State [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2718.86s)]
*  Department, I'm in charge of the day-to-day implementation of our Iran policy at the department [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2724.54s)]
*  and nothing has changed in terms of our implementation of that policy. We work across the department [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2730.6600000000003s)]
*  and across the interagency to continue to advance President Biden and Secretary Blinken's [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2736.6600000000003s)]
*  focus on countering Iran, which remains a top adversary and state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2743.02s)]
*  Can you provide any clarity as to why Mr. Malley's security clearance was suspended? [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2749.3s)]
*  Unfortunately, I'm not in a position today to speak to personnel or security clearance [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2755.18s)]
*  issues. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2760.78s)]
*  Is that something that perhaps you all could answer in a classified setting? [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2761.58s)]
*  I know that the department is engaged with this committee and other committees on certain [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2766.94s)]
*  issues related to this case, but today again, I'm not in a position to speak to security [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2772.94s)]
*  clearance issues. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2778.2200000000003s)]
*  If it's possible to get more clarity on that in that setting, we'd certainly appreciate [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2778.5800000000004s)]
*  it. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2783.2200000000003s)]
*  We will certainly take the question back. Thank you. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2783.5s)]
*  All right. In September, the Department of Treasury established what it called a humanitarian [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2786.34s)]
*  channel in Qatar. I think we're all familiar with that action to administer $6 billion [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2790.5400000000004s)]
*  in Iranian assets from South Korea. It is described as a way to, quote, further facilitate [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2796.86s)]
*  the flow of humanitarian assistance to the people of Iran. Assistant Secretary Rosenberg, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2802.5s)]
*  why did Treasury decide to create a, quote, humanitarian, unquote, channel? And is this [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2808.22s)]
*  a common mechanism for Treasury? [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2816.74s)]
*  Thank you for the question. As to the why, I'd be very happy to defer to my State Department [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2820.78s)]
*  colleague, given that the creation of this particular mechanism was pursuant to a deal [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2825.78s)]
*  on the exchange of detainees between Iran and the United States. I will defer on that. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2830.8199999999997s)]
*  With regard to is this common practice, is there precedent for this, in the last administration, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2838.58s)]
*  there was an effort to establish a, there was an establishment of a Swiss humanitarian [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2844.4199999999996s)]
*  channel to pursue the same goal, which is to say to take Iranian funds, highly restricted, [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2848.58s)]
*  and that could be used only for humanitarian purposes, subject to intense vetting, akin [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2856.42s)]
*  to what I had just described in the prior questioning. So there is precedent for this. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2861.42s)]
*  This is another example that builds on lessons learned and is in a different jurisdiction. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2866.42s)]
*  So practically, and I'll let, Mr. Paley, I'll let you clarify as well, but is there a stark [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2874.8199999999997s)]
*  difference between a humanitarian channel and other escrow accounts that are available [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2880.82s)]
*  to Iran for humanitarian trade purposes? And either one of you. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2887.82s)]
*  I can answer that. So the, it is the case that there's special conditions around a humanitarian [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2894.82s)]
*  channel understood as such, which is to say the establishment of such a humanitarian channel [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2904.6600000000003s)]
*  is designed and established exclusively for humanitarian payments. And as I was noting [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2909.66s)]
*  before, it can be the case that certain potential recipients of the funds are pre-vetted. They [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2921.7s)]
*  can only be customers of an institution. It's designed for that purpose. Generally speaking, [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2927.8999999999996s)]
*  the U.S. law policy and sanctions allow for payments, Iran as well as for other countries [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2933.46s)]
*  subject to intensive sanctions and other programs to be able to pay for humanitarian transactions. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2941.98s)]
*  But this is a particularized channel established with conditionality around it, even though [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2948.68s)]
*  it could be permitted to pay for humanitarian goods in a different account, but subject [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2954.7s)]
*  to, that would not be an account established exclusively for humanitarian purposes. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2961.7s)]
*  And give us some sense, some greater sense of what data Treasury is relying on to ensure [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2967.46s)]
*  that the humanitarian channels are the most effective way to get the appropriate assistance [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2972.9399999999996s)]
*  to Iranian citizens. How are you measuring that? What's the data source that you use [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2980.8999999999996s)]
*  to measure that effectively? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2987.4399999999996s)]
*  That's an interesting question. I would offer that our highest purpose here is to, and the [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2990.46s)]
*  purpose that guides our policy overall, is to ensure that Iran does not have access to [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=2997.54s)]
*  money it can use for terror and destabilization. And so— [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3002.14s)]
*  Our time has expired, but I would appreciate it if you might expand on that for the record. [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3006.9s)]
*  Thank you. I yield back. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3011.46s)]
*  Gentlemen yields back. With that, the ranking member from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3013.94s)]
*  for five minutes. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3018.2200000000003s)]
*  I reserve and ask that you go to the next member that's available for questioning. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3018.98s)]
*  We're, sorry, Mr. Green, we're going to have you, this will be our last, this is our last. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3023.98s)]
*  So it is, unless we are willing to do a second round, which I'm happy to do, I know there's [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3032.58s)]
*  more questions. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3037.7400000000002s)]
*  Mr. Chair, I would refer you to the committee rules, and I'll quote, the chair shall so [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3039.38s)]
*  far as practicable, defer to the ranking member with respect to the order of recognition for [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3047.2200000000003s)]
*  minority members. I have no additional minority members, and I reserve and I ask that you [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3054.7400000000002s)]
*  go to a member who is prepared to speak on your side. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3060.62s)]
*  I'm happy to engage in this conversation about our rules. You have control of your side of [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3065.54s)]
*  the aisle. If you don't have any more members, you are the last one, so therefore it's your [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3072.82s)]
*  turn. I have more members on my side, and that's the discretion of the chair, so I'm [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3080.3s)]
*  not doing anything funky with the rules. It's your turn. So I know you'd like to have the [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3088.14s)]
*  last word, but that's not how this works. We have more members over on this side. The [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3095.66s)]
*  majority is going to get the last word. So the gentleman can bypass his ability to have [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3101.74s)]
*  a question. I'm happy to go to a second round of questioning, because I know I certainly [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3108.22s)]
*  have more questions. So would the gentleman agree to a second round? [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3113.9799999999996s)]
*  The gentleman would ask that the chair adhere to the rules and in so doing respect my right [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3118.3799999999997s)]
*  to pass, and I appreciate your highly technical terminology of funky, but this is in my opinion [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3125.98s)]
*  something that is appropriate under the rules. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3134.42s)]
*  The gentleman will understand that I am adhering to the rules, which is you get to determine, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3137.6600000000003s)]
*  you had the ranking member go first, you always nicely defer to your members and always go [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3144.54s)]
*  last on your side of the aisle. If we are ending this hearing, it is the majority is [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3150.54s)]
*  not only right, but because we have enough people over here as we alternate, the gentleman [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3157.54s)]
*  from Pennsylvania is going to go last. So it is the ranking member's choice as to whether [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3164.1s)]
*  he wants to claim his five minute time. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3170.38s)]
*  We have deferred to the ranking member on his side. We have given him the ability to [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3173.38s)]
*  choose to have their full ranking member. Hold on. Please tell me that you recognize [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3188.7000000000003s)]
*  how foolish and childish this is. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3195.7s)]
*  Excuse me, allow me to respond to that. It was not necessary for you to use the term [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3202.7s)]
*  foolish and childish. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3209.7s)]
*  So the chair shouts, hold on just a moment. I have been very respectful of you. Now you [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3210.9399999999996s)]
*  will respect me. Respect me if you don't respect the rules. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3216.1s)]
*  Gentleman knows I have full respect for you. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3221.94s)]
*  Then foolish and childish is not the way to address a member of Congress. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3224.22s)]
*  Excuse me, sir. I was actually referring to the staff behind us that was interrupting [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3228.7s)]
*  our proceedings. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3233.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, I would defend the staff. I don't think you refer to the staff as foolish and childish. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3234.2599999999998s)]
*  Actually I did as I turned around looking at your staff and our staff. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3240.42s)]
*  I would say to you that is inappropriate for a member of Congress to refer to staff. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3243.38s)]
*  Would the gentleman like to proceed or would you like to continue to argue about the process? [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3246.2999999999997s)]
*  The member I reserve. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3250.3s)]
*  So the gentleman, just to be clear, the ruling of the chair will be that the gentleman is [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3254.6600000000003s)]
*  forfeiting his five minutes. The gentleman from Pennsylvania will be recognized and that [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3258.1000000000004s)]
*  will be the end of the hearing. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3262.98s)]
*  I appeal the ruling of the chair. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3264.38s)]
*  That is your choice. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3267.84s)]
*  I appeal the ruling of the chair. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3268.84s)]
*  I haven't done anything yet. I'm giving you your options or we can continue on with a [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3270.1400000000003s)]
*  I'm happy to then go back if you would like to get the ranking member or Ms. Garcia or [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3276.58s)]
*  any of your other members here. Happy to do that. But either I'm going to recognize you [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3281.8199999999997s)]
*  for your five minutes or I'm going to recognize the gentleman from Pennsylvania for five minutes [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3288.18s)]
*  and when the gentleman from Pennsylvania is done, the hearing is done. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3293.2599999999998s)]
*  So what is your choice? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3298.1s)]
*  May I ask you a question? Would you be so kind as to receive a question as chair? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3300.02s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3304.06s)]
*  Your contention is that the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be the very last person? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3305.14s)]
*  Unless we have more members on our side or your side show up. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3310.18s)]
*  Would you hold for a moment, please? [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3315.18s)]
*  Happy to. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3318.18s)]
*  So you realize this is going to be a full committee. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3335.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3365.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3395.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3425.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3455.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3485.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3515.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3545.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3575.18s)]
*  All right. For the fine folks on C-SPAN that are riveted by what has been going on with [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3588.18s)]
*  the discussion of our committee rules, tradition is that we alternate majority to minority. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3593.34s)]
*  The majority always starts, the majority always closes. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3601.6200000000003s)]
*  That request has been to be changed. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3605.6200000000003s)]
*  I have had having an understanding with the ranking member now that we will be at his [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3610.06s)]
*  request running through the rest of our committee members, the Republican committee members. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3619.1400000000003s)]
*  He will then claim the last five minutes of questioning, at which point I will grant him [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3627.86s)]
*  an extended time for a closing remark, at which point then I will have that same amount [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3632.9s)]
*  of time for my closing remarks to end the hearing. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3638.66s)]
*  So after lots of back and forth, it is now the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Muser, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3644.06s)]
*  is recognized for five minutes. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3653.2599999999998s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3654.98s)]
*  So, Mr. Pearley, do you think the $6 billion and Ms. Rosenberg will be only used for humanitarian [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3656.86s)]
*  purposes? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3663.66s)]
*  You pretty much stated that, right? [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3664.66s)]
*  Even though the Iranian President, Razi, said they will use it for whatever they want, whenever [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3666.86s)]
*  we need it, do you not believe, as the Iranian President, not to be trusted in his words? [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3672.5s)]
*  I would certainly not believe everything that the Iranian President says. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3680.02s)]
*  Okay, so the Iranian President should not be believed in this case, or do you just pick [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3683.06s)]
*  and choose when you believe him and don't believe him? [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3687.78s)]
*  We don't trust the Iranians. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3690.46s)]
*  We view them as an adversary and as a sponsor. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3691.5s)]
*  Okay, so why do you think then that the aid would not be used for other purposes? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3693.3s)]
*  Do you understand what the term fungible means? [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3697.78s)]
*  You probably do. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3699.66s)]
*  You're pretty educated, right? [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3700.66s)]
*  You know what fungible means? [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3701.66s)]
*  Okay, so if Iran has $50 million and they get $50 million and they were going to use [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3703.98s)]
*  that $50 million for food and then they get a new $50 million, they can use the new $50 [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3709.66s)]
*  million for food and use the old $50 million to buy weapons for terrorists. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3715.06s)]
*  You get that, right? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3720.02s)]
*  Sir? [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3721.74s)]
*  So why don't you think that's going to happen if you don't trust them? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3722.74s)]
*  Thanks very much for the question. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3725.46s)]
*  So I have full confidence in the due diligence measures that Assistant Secretary Rosenberg [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3727.42s)]
*  has outlined for this money. [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3732.18s)]
*  It can only be used for humanitarian purposes. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3733.58s)]
*  You know, there's an expression up by me. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3735.14s)]
*  You know, there's a bridge in Brooklyn that I'd like to show you and see if you're interested [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3736.8199999999997s)]
*  in. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3741.66s)]
*  That's just absurd and I think you know it. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3742.66s)]
*  And in your memoirs, you'll probably write it that way. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3744.8599999999997s)]
*  What about the $10 billion from Iraq? [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3747.8199999999997s)]
*  That's not fungible either. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3751.7s)]
*  That will be highly monitored and we'll watch where every penny goes? [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3753.42s)]
*  So in terms of the due diligence, both of these sets of funds can only be used for [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3760.18s)]
*  humanitarian transactions and we have a great deal of… [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3765.06s)]
*  In theory, in weak theory, against a regime that we don't trust, that we know is bombing [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3767.8999999999996s)]

*  Is that permanent that not one penny of that six billion dollars will go to Iran? [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3784.7799999999997s)]
*  As we've said, we do not expect this money to go anywhere, anytime. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3789.28s)]
*  Okay, so but can you guarantee me it's not permanent? [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3792.6800000000003s)]
*  It is permanent? [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3794.8s)]
*  What we've said, and this is based on US law… [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3796.5600000000004s)]
*  So it's not. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3799.28s)]
*  So really we should have said yet, not one penny yet has gone to the Iranian terrorist [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3800.28s)]
*  regime. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3805.28s)]
*  That's more of a correct statement. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3806.28s)]
*  The sanctions in Iran, we're stating that the sanctions in Iran now are stronger than [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3810.36s)]
*  the sanctions in Iran during the previous administration, even though Iran's reserves [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3815.32s)]
*  went from four billion dollars to God knows where, eighty billion dollars. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3820.84s)]
*  Even though that is a fact, you're going to sit there and tell me that, tell us, tell [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3825.96s)]
*  the world that the sanctions today are stronger than they were under the previous administration, [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3830.88s)]
*  even though there's been a reversal of fortune. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3837.36s)]
*  So this administration, we have not lifted any sanctions against Iran, and in fact we [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3844.1s)]
*  have actually rolled out countless numbers of sanctions. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3848.2999999999997s)]
*  Is it true that the amount of oil exported from Iran is nearly ten times what it was [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3853.5s)]
*  four years ago? [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3858.38s)]
*  We continue to closely monitor oil exports. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3860.14s)]
*  I'm asking a question, is it true or false? [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3862.42s)]
*  Is it true that the amount of oil being exported from Iran is nearly ten times more than it [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3864.98s)]
*  was four years ago? [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3869.06s)]
*  Even though you didn't change the sanctions. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3871.2s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3873.1s)]
*  Mr. Congressman, the oil exports from Iran have fluctuated over time. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3874.1s)]
*  There are a variety of reasons for that, but what does remain in place is all of our sanctions, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3878.74s)]
*  which we continue to enforce. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3884.06s)]
*  The sanctions aren't working, clearly. [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3885.98s)]
*  In fact, they're one-tenth what they were before in enforcement. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3888.14s)]
*  The International Atomic Energy Agency found many violations, okay, I was there, of the [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3891.8999999999996s)]
*  Iranian enrichment taking place in Iran, many violations. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3899.3s)]
*  Can Iran be trusted to abide by those so-called rules that are trying to be worked out with [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3903.86s)]
*  the Biden administration with no surprise inspections in place? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3909.6600000000003s)]
*  Thanks for the question. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3914.82s)]
*  So the Biden administration has been clear that we will never let Iran get a nuclear [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3915.82s)]
*  weapon. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3920.98s)]
*  One of the things that we have done is continue to encourage our partners and allies to press [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3921.98s)]
*  Iran to cooperate more fully with the IAEA. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3928.6s)]
*  We engage regularly with the IAEA, and this is one of our top priorities. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3932.0s)]
*  I hope so. [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3936.0s)]
*  Do you agree that Iran is the primary supporter of terrorism and supporting the number one [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3937.72s)]
*  supporter of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and behind the nearly 100 attacks on American [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3944.0s)]

*  I know everyone in this room is committed to protecting the United States, and I appreciate [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3976.56s)]
*  your public service and the bipartisan work on this committee to hold Iran accountable. [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3980.92s)]
*  There is work that needs to continue here, and this is one of the reasons we're in the [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3986.72s)]
*  Financial Services Committee today, because on October 7th, the attack on Israel was one [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3990.08s)]
*  of the most heinous elements that we've seen, and we can all agree that Iran was one of [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3994.8399999999997s)]
*  the primary funders for this attack to occur by Hamas. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=3998.16s)]
*  Challengingly, the United States has stalled in freezing Iran assets, though. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4002.2s)]
*  The $6 billion in illegal oil sales, we have been good on this committee, and I am proud [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4007.08s)]
*  the commitment that we will never transfer that money to Iran. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4012.16s)]
*  However, they are continuing to move an unprecedented amount of oil out of the country for sale [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4016.8799999999997s)]
*  through a ghost armada. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4022.92s)]
*  We've been briefed on this in both the classified setting and the public setting, so today we'll [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4025.52s)]
*  talk at the unclassed level, but we understand that this amount of new funding, over $80 [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4028.3599999999997s)]
*  billion, or to put that in another term, 400% increase since these tough sanctions we've [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4034.7599999999998s)]
*  talked about, has actually increased. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4039.44s)]
*  And it's precipitated a number of threats to the region, not just to Israel, but to [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4041.48s)]
*  our own forces right in the Middle East, areas where I have flown multiple combat operations [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4045.6s)]
*  out of, and received over 100 attacks, as has been highlighted today, in just the last [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4050.7200000000003s)]
*  weeks alone. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4054.7200000000003s)]
*  And during my time as a counterintelligence officer, I personally witnessed the shady [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4055.7200000000003s)]
*  tactics of the Iranian regime and their work to combat U.S. interests in the region, as [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4059.88s)]
*  by undermining them through nefarious relationships with Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthi rebels, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4067.08s)]
*  and ultimately through the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4072.16s)]
*  So let's get started. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4077.48s)]
*  I want to talk to you, Ms. Rosenberg. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4078.48s)]
*  Talk to us about, first of all, how the Iranians are getting, you work on Treasury, how they're [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4082.48s)]
*  able to get oil out of Iran through these sanctions using ships that fly under false [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4087.44s)]

*  Thank you very much for the question. [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4095.2799999999997s)]
*  Iran uses a variety of methods in order to try and earn money. [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4098.32s)]
*  I appreciate you- [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4104.92s)]
*  Talk to me specifically about the ships. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4105.92s)]
*  Let's get to it. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4106.92s)]
*  Using obscured means, front companies, a network of individuals who are not who they say they [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4109.32s)]
*  are. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4117.32s)]
*  They look to flag registries and insurance providers that don't look carefully- [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4118.32s)]
*  There's an interesting point, particularly on the insurance providers. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4124.8s)]
*  What has Treasury done to clamp down on these ships? [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4126.64s)]
*  Because ultimately, while they fly under false flags, the insurance companies ultimately are [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4130.04s)]
*  the ones where you have the ability to help stop this. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4135.0s)]
*  What have you done to stop the insurance providers? [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4137.76s)]
*  If they have any touch point to U.S. jurisdiction, we have opportunities. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4142.56s)]
*  Great. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4146.6s)]
*  How many have we shut down? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4147.6s)]
*  The issue that you're getting at here is that Iran looks to fly-by-night providers that [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4149.48s)]
*  would seriously concern all of us in terms of their ability to pay out if there's a spill [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4155.44s)]
*  or any security situation. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4160.28s)]
*  I would agree. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4161.5199999999995s)]
*  Yes. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4162.5199999999995s)]
*  Have we identified any of the insurance providers and taken action? [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4163.5199999999995s)]
*  Iran uses its own insurance provision here, which is- [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4165.639999999999s)]
*  40% of the fleet, as we understand through the United Against Iran Nuclear, says that [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4168.5199999999995s)]
*  there's a U.S. company, the American Steamship Company, that's providing it. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4174.16s)]
*  What action have we taken against the American Steamship Company right here on U.S. soil? [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4177.6s)]
*  Getting to your point, any U.S. person, insurance provider, ship broker, flagging authority, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4183.4400000000005s)]
*  trader, anyone involved in the movement of Iranian oil as obligations and liabilities [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4189.72s)]
*  in our jurisdiction- [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4196.64s)]
*  I understand that. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4197.64s)]
*  We all do. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4198.64s)]
*  What have you done to hold them accountable? [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4199.64s)]
*  On the specific entity that you asked about, I don't have an answer for you and I'd be [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4200.76s)]

*  You are Treasury. [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4210.72s)]
*  What other U.S. entities are providing insurance to Iranian Ghost Fleet ships? [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4212.360000000001s)]
*  None that I'm aware of. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4218.04s)]
*  All right, I'm going to hold you to that. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4219.04s)]
*  Let's follow up then. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4222.96s)]
*  Mr. Paley, I want to talk with you on, are you aware that Iran has a history of freeing [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4223.96s)]
*  up funds to provide assistance to proxies in the region for terrorist purposes? [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4227.96s)]

*  And so when we talk about the humanitarian aid piece, let's talk about the Turk Bank. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4236.68s)]
*  It's gone before U.S. review. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4241.16s)]
*  We have seen that Iran has a long history of taking money intended to help the Iranian [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4243.72s)]
*  people and use it to fund terrorism. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4248.52s)]
*  Would you agree with that? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4250.64s)]
*  We have long expressed our concerns about this and that's why we have- [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4252.54s)]
*  Tell me a tangible action that you've taken to clamp down on this. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4255.72s)]
*  Well, we have, first of all, worked very closely with our Treasury colleagues to ensure that [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4259.08s)]
*  strict due diligence- [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4265.2s)]
*  Agreed. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4266.2s)]
*  Has it stopped any of the flow of oil? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4267.400000000001s)]
*  Because I've only seen increases. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4269.72s)]
*  In terms of the flow of oil, we also have a series of actions that we continue to roll [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4271.92s)]
*  out to address these issues. [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4277.8s)]
*  In addition to sanctions, we also have diplomatic outreach to a variety of different countries [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4279.320000000001s)]
*  when we are aware that they are involved somehow- [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4284.38s)]
*  Mr. Paley, I would like a listing of all the actions that have actually resulted in a reduction [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4287.04s)]
*  of oil flow out of Iran and to terrorist groups. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4291.54s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Chair. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4294.04s)]
*  I yield my time. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4295.04s)]
*  The gentleman's time has expired and I will remind everyone on the committee that they [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4296.04s)]
*  are able to submit to, through the chair, questions in writing to our witnesses who [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4299.0s)]
*  are expected to respond promptly. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4305.48s)]
*  Now, finally, the long-awaited gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, the ranking member, is recognized [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4308.28s)]
*  for five minutes before we will then move to a separate two-minute closing. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4314.36s)]
*  So the gentleman is recognized for five minutes and then an additional two minutes. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4321.84s)]
*  Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4326.64s)]
*  I am going to read from an article that was printed on Tuesday, December 12, 2023, and [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4329.96s)]
*  ask that it be admitted in the record at a later time. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4339.12s)]
*  My colleagues-this is not contained in the article-are concerned about fungibility, but [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4342.8s)]
*  it is selective fungibility. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4348.44s)]
*  Not a lot of concern about what happened with money and cash in a previous administration. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4351.96s)]
*  The article is style. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4358.64s)]
*  Qatar sent millions to Gaza for years with Israel's backing. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4360.2s)]
*  Here's what we know about the controversial deal. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4365.56s)]
*  I shall not read it in its entirety. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4367.8s)]
*  I'll read excerpts. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4369.84s)]
*  When did the Qatar payment start? [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4372.16s)]
*  In 2018, Qatar began making monthly payments to Gaza Strip. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4375.44s)]
*  Some 15 million were sent to Gaza in cash-filled suitcases. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4380.96s)]
*  There was some talk earlier about cash and how it is fungible. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4386.04s)]
*  The money was supposed to go into Gaza to help with payments to people who were working [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4390.5199999999995s)]
*  to help the persons who live in Gaza, but cash is supposed to be fungible. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4396.28s)]
*  15 million sent in cash-filled suitcases delivered by the Qataris through Israeli territory after [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4403.719999999999s)]
*  months of negotiation. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4411.88s)]
*  And then it goes on to read, Israel approved the deal in a security cabinet meeting in [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4414.48s)]
*  August 2018 when Netanyahu was serving his previous tenure as prime minister. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4421.5199999999995s)]
*  The US, that would be under the Trump administration I'm adding, was aware of the Qatari payments [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4430.52s)]
*  to Hamas. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4437.280000000001s)]
*  A former senior State Department official involved in the region told CNN on condition [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4438.280000000001s)]
*  of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4443.68s)]
*  Goes on to read, Slomo Brom, a former deputy to Israel's national security advisor, told [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4449.4400000000005s)]
*  the New York Times that an empowered Hamas helped Netanyahu avoid negotiating over a [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4459.8s)]
*  Palestinian state, saying the division of the Palestinians helped him make the case [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4468.8s)]
*  that he had no partner for peace in Palestine, thus avoiding pressure for peace talks that [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4478.76s)]
*  could lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian state. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4487.68s)]
*  You see, this money was sent to Hamas or to the persons in Gaza because the PA, the Palestinian [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4493.280000000001s)]
*  authority, was withholding making payments. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4501.280000000001s)]
*  And as a result, this money was to fill in this gap. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4505.64s)]
*  Now here's what Naftali Bennett said. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4511.96s)]
*  A former Israeli prime minister told CNN Sunday that after years of flagging his concerns [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4514.2s)]
*  to Netanyahu when he was prime minister of education, this is Bennett, he stopped the [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4521.28s)]
*  suitcase transfers when he became prime minister in 2021. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4527.64s)]
*  And here's an exact quote from him. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4533.56s)]
*  I stopped the cash suitcases because I believe that horrendous mistake to allow Hamas to [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4536.599999999999s)]
*  have all these suitcases full of cash that goes directly to reordering themselves against [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4546.839999999999s)]
*  Israelis. [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4556.0s)]
*  This is an exact quote. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4558.36s)]
*  Why would we feed them cash to kill us? [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4560.24s)]
*  Bennett asked. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4565.48s)]
*  Continuing. [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4568.799999999999s)]
*  Qatar denies those funds were intended for Hamas, saying they were meant as aid to salaries [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4573.04s)]
*  of workers in the besieged enclave. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4581.2s)]
*  So friends, under the theory of fungibility given to us today by my colleagues, when you [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4584.759999999999s)]
*  give money to workers that Hamas might normally have to use from its coffer, now you have [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4592.64s)]
*  aided Hamas. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4601.200000000001s)]
*  And the United States was aware of all of this under the Trump administration. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4603.160000000001s)]
*  I'm bringing this to our attention for many reasons, but my principal reason is this. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4609.6s)]
*  I believe in a two-state solution. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4614.76s)]
*  I believe in it so strongly that I have a resolution that I have filed indicating that [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4617.04s)]
*  we should have a state for the Palestinians. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4622.32s)]
*  We have filed such a resolution to benefit the Israelis. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4626.24s)]
*  I support Israel. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4629.599999999999s)]
*  I voted for more than $50 billion to support Israel. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4630.88s)]
*  But I think it's time for us to have a Palestinian state, and I regret that Mr. Netanyahu has [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4634.32s)]
*  thwarted these efforts. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4639.599999999999s)]
*  The gentleman's time has expired, and now we will put two minutes on the clock for you [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4640.599999999999s)]
*  to have a closing statement. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4645.28s)]
*  But one minute. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4647.84s)]
*  I think we agreed on one each. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4648.84s)]
*  Discretion of the chair. [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4651.280000000001s)]
*  I'm giving you up to two minutes. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4652.4800000000005s)]
*  How about that? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4654.52s)]
*  Well, but is that because you will have two as well? [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4655.52s)]
*  It will be even. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4660.12s)]
*  Okay. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4661.12s)]
*  Well, I don't mind it being even. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4662.12s)]
*  It will be even. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4663.12s)]
*  The gentleman is recognized for one minute for a closing statement. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4664.12s)]
*  All right, then I'll take a part of my one minute to say this. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4667.4400000000005s)]
*  We agreed on one minute. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4669.8s)]
*  And if you want to change what we agreed to, I think you should at least respect me enough [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4671.700000000001s)]
*  to say let's change the agreement and make it two. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4675.72s)]
*  That was our agreement. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4678.92s)]
*  One minute. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4679.92s)]
*  And which is why I am saying one minute. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4680.92s)]
*  I was attempting to be charitable to give the gentleman up to two minutes. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4682.12s)]
*  But in respect for our handshake agreement, the gentleman will be recognized for one minute. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4686.24s)]
*  I greatly appreciate the chair honoring our handshake agreement. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4693.12s)]
*  Friends, as you can see, these issues can become quite contentious. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4696.68s)]
*  But here's where we are. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4701.46s)]
*  Fungibility is something that was contemplated, I am sure, when these protocols, these rules [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4704.4800000000005s)]
*  these laws were drafted. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4710.04s)]
*  I don't know how you can contend that people can't process funds in this way. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4711.56s)]
*  But here's the point. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4717.24s)]
*  We still want to provide humanitarian assistance to people who need it. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4719.14s)]
*  I support this humanitarian assistance. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4722.84s)]
*  But what I don't support is empowering Hamas, as Mr. Netanyahu did, so that Hamas could [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4725.56s)]
*  be the perfect enemy. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4734.04s)]
*  He could utilize Hamas because Hamas wants to destroy Israel and say, I can't negotiate [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4736.4800000000005s)]
*  for peace. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4742.72s)]
*  We can't have a two-state solution because Hamas is not amenable to that kind of peace [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4744.28s)]
*  talk. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4751.76s)]
*  That is what I'm opposed to. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4753.16s)]
*  And I yield back the balance of my time. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4755.24s)]
*  Gentlemen, time has expired. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4758.32s)]
*  Now I'll recognize myself for a one-minute close. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4759.32s)]
*  We have both said today that keeping money in Iraq was a benefit to Iran. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4762.16s)]
*  So are we to assume that Iran did not support the transfer to Oman and other jurisdictions? [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4766.04s)]
*  I didn't think so. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4772.24s)]
*  It's clear that the transfer was at the request of Iran to the Biden administration. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4773.4s)]
*  Ms. Rosenberg said that she couldn't tell us or wouldn't tell us today in an open setting [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4778.36s)]
*  if there had been problems with the transactions out of Oman, the two transactions out of Oman [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4783.32s)]
*  that have been acknowledged. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4788.88s)]
*  And the way I understand it, that saying yes or no is not classified. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4790.04s)]
*  But I guess if the answer is yes, you apparently didn't want to confirm that on the record. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4795.2s)]
*  I expect a follow-up in a classified statement and a statement setting for all of us to understand [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4800.52s)]
*  why this is classified. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4808.92s)]
*  Additionally, Ms. Rosenberg spoke at length about the controls of the Europeans, but the [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4809.92s)]
*  Europeans do not have control over money in Oman or Qatar. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4813.32s)]
*  Mr. Paley repeatedly said to Ms. Garcia that there have not been any transactions. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4817.0s)]
*  To be clear, Ms. Rosenberg said there have been two transactions with money in Oman and [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4821.56s)]
*  that there were problems and she would not answer that. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4825.92s)]
*  So what I think he meant to say is that there have not been any transactions yet using the [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4828.12s)]
*  money out of Qatar. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4832.0s)]
*  And finally, we sent a very narrow document request on the waiver issue to Treasury that [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4833.0s)]
*  remains outstanding. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4837.08s)]
*  Ms. Rosenberg, I expect that Treasury will produce an outstanding documents quickly. [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4838.08s)]
*  It's my duty to inform everybody that if you have additional questions for the… that [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4842.52s)]
*  all members will have five legislative days within which to submit additional written [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4851.56s)]
*  questions for the witnesses to the Chair, which will be forwarded to the witnesses for [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4855.92s)]
*  the response. [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4860.080000000001s)]
*  I ask our witnesses to please respond as promptly as you are able and this hearing is adjourned. [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5M77QNYf0UQ&t=4861.080000000001s)]
