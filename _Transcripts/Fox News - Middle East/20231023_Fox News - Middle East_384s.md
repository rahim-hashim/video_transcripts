# Israeli lawmaker urges public to recognize Hamas's misinformation tactics
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 23, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ)
*  The truth shall set you free if you can find it, which can be difficult in the middle of [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=0.0s)]
*  war. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=6.78s)]
*  Truth that has been said is the first casualty of war, and some media outlets are proving [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  just that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=13.700000000000001s)]
*  Misinformation is just another weapon to be wielded by those who oppose Israel. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=14.700000000000001s)]
*  Words matter, and some of the left just cannot bring themselves to condemn a terrorist group [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=20.94s)]
*  that beheads children. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=27.38s)]
*  So what and who to believe in a dangerous and challenging time? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=30.24s)]
*  Israel is surrounded by enemies, Hamas to the south, Hezbollah to the north, Iran wreaking [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=35.4s)]
*  havoc in the region, China threatening to insert itself. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=40.92s)]
*  The enemies of Israel should be forewarned. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=45.06s)]
*  The world's greatest military is positioned in the Mediterranean Sea and has pledged [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=48.26s)]
*  unfailing support for Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=53.78s)]
*  We're joined now by Danny Denon, Israel's former ambassador to the UN, current member [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=59.58s)]
*  of the Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committees. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=64.28s)]
*  Welcome. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=67.7s)]
*  There is so much misinformation out there, either by negligence or with intent. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=68.7s)]
*  The hospital in Gaza is a perfect example. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=74.14s)]
*  viewers get the facts in a war half a world away? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=77.3s)]
*  So as you mentioned, Trey, our enemies lie all the time. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=84.46s)]
*  You mentioned the hospital. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=89.46s)]
*  They lied about the number of casualties. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=91.16s)]
*  It was maybe a dozen people who died, and they said 500 people. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=94.17999999999999s)]
*  And they lied about the source. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=98.7s)]
*  They blamed Israel. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=100.6s)]
*  And many networks immediately adopted their version. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=101.92s)]
*  So I think the audience should be smart, should understand that it's part of the [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=105.52s)]
*  warfare of the terrorists, to play with the media. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=110.16s)]
*  And they became very good at it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=114.8s)]
*  You know, they plan everything. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=116.03999999999999s)]
*  And even when you look at the atrocities they committed two weeks ago in our communities, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=117.75999999999999s)]
*  they took the time to videotape everything and to broadcast it live on Facebook. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  So they know how to play with the media. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=129.18s)]
*  We have to understand it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=132.4s)]
*  I think what we have to do, we have to win in the battleground. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=135.24s)]
*  Maybe if they will continue to lie and we will continue to fight, at the end of the [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=138.76s)]
*  day, they will not be around to message or to send anything to anyone. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=142.8s)]
*  Ambassador, there are some in the region, and frankly, there are some American politicians, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=147.88s)]
*  who have set this up as the West against Arabs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=154.56s)]
*  Surely there are Arab nations, to your point about the barbarism committed by Hamas, surely [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=159.52s)]
*  there are Arab nations who understand you cannot do what Hamas did and not expect some [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=165.5s)]
*  kind of reprisal. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=172.22s)]
*  So I don't accept it. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=175.94s)]
*  I have many Arab friends, and they called me after they saw the barbaric behavior of [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=177.68s)]
*  the Hamas ISIS terrorist organization. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=182.78s)]
*  And they told me, we condemn it. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=186.0s)]
*  This is not part of Islam. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  This is not part of our mentality or heritage. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=188.88s)]
*  And I believe them, because they know that those radicals will come after them. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=192.9s)]
*  Moderate Muslims, they don't accept those radicals. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=197.46s)]
*  So I think we should focus on the radicals, and we should get the support from the moderate [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=200.54s)]
*  Arab countries. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=204.96s)]
*  And they should be strong. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=206.32s)]
*  They should tell their people, we cannot endorse those inhuman barbaric who actually killed [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=207.32s)]
*  babies, raped women, kidnapped more than 200 people. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=214.82s)]
*  No one can justify such a behavior. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=219.68s)]
*  Ambassador, are there any Arab nations that are willing, if this is a humanitarian crisis, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=222.56s)]
*  if it is going to be a humanitarian crisis, are there Arab nations that are willing to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=231.22s)]
*  let the Palestinians cross their border and hang out there? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=236.66s)]
*  The innocent Palestinians, not Hamas, but are Arab nations willing to help out and let [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=241.16s)]
*  Palestinians come while this war is prosecuted? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=246.26s)]
*  Well, you know, in the past, we have seen refugees moving from Syria into Jordan, into [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=249.01999999999998s)]
*  Turkey. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=257.06s)]
*  But you know what we have seen? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=258.06s)]
*  We have seen a few countries say, we will never accept Palestinians. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=259.14s)]
*  So instead of saying that they're reaching a hand to their brothers and sisters, they're [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=263.42s)]
*  saying the opposite. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=267.46s)]
*  We will not accept anyone from Gaza. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=268.7s)]
*  And I think that's a pity. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=271.62s)]
*  I think, you know, they should look into receiving those people who want to leave Gaza. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=273.42s)]
*  And because some of them, you know, they live under the occupation of Hamas, under the Hamas [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=279.78s)]
*  regime, I'm sure they would have been very happy to move to another place. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=284.34s)]
*  Before I let you go, everyone believes a ground offensive is imminent. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=290.58s)]
*  The time gives Hamas a chance to prepare. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=295.62s)]
*  I guess it also builds world opinion. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=300.22s)]
*  What do you attribute the delay from the time of the attacks by Hamas until the ground offensive? [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=304.22s)]
*  What do you attribute the delay to? [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=309.82s)]
*  So we are determined to eradicate Hamas today. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=313.82s)]
*  We will do it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=316.52s)]
*  I can guarantee it to you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=317.52s)]
*  But we take the time to prepare. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=318.94s)]
*  We don't care how long it will take. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=321.26s)]
*  We will go in. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=323.3s)]
*  We will hunt them down and we will eliminate them, period. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=324.42s)]
*  So you know, they are already there. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=328.18s)]
*  We know that. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=329.5s)]
*  But they have been waiting for us for years. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=330.5s)]
*  And we will go slowly. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=332.34000000000003s)]
*  I called the troops today and I told the commanders, take your time. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=334.26s)]
*  Don't risk our troops when you go in. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=338.34000000000003s)]
*  Do what you have to do in order to eliminate Hamas. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  And also we allowed the population in northern Gaza to move south. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=343.94s)]
*  Seventy percent of the population already moved south. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=348.18s)]
*  And we hope that more people will move south because Hamas is hiding behind those civilians. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=351.34000000000003s)]
*  And we hope to minimize the number of civilian casualties. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=357.3s)]
*  Ambassador, thank you for joining us. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=362.3s)]
*  We will continue to be watching. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=364.42s)]
*  And America stands in solidarity with Israel. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=366.54s)]
*  Thank you, Trey. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=371.3s)]
*  You cannot get it anywhere else. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouWuu0TRkAQ&t=381.3s)]
