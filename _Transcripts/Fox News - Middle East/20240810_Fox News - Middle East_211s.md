# Iran is in a dilemma: Retired Maj. Gen. Dana Pittard
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c)
*  All right, the U.S. military stepping up its posture in the Middle East by sending in fighter jets. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=0.0s)]
*  That's as America's reportedly warning Iran about the serious risk of carrying out any retaliatory strike on Israel. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=6.32s)]
*  Retired U.S. Army Major General Dana Petard joins us now to react. General, thanks for being here. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=13.32s)]
*  You know, we thought we'd see a retaliation from Iran a lot sooner for the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=18.6s)]
*  assassination of the or the killing of the Hamas leader in Tehran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=24.48s)]
*  But we haven't. Why do you think we haven't seen that attack yet? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=28.080000000000002s)]
*  Well, good morning, Pete. In fact, I wish I was there doing pull ups and push ups and swimming and running also. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=32.68s)]
*  There's always an extra, General. You're always invited. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=39.0s)]
*  Will do. Well, I think part of the reason why Iran hasn't responded yet is they're just not sure how to respond. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  They don't want a full blown war with with Israel, not at all, but they are in a dilemma. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=51.32s)]
*  They feel like they must respond. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=57.84s)]
*  Many of the people in Iran feel that the government should respond. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=61.2s)]
*  And so they're going to pick and choose their time, which isn't helpful to the overall situation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=64.76s)]
*  No doubt. How about our posture, General? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=71.6s)]
*  We'll put up on the screen here the amount of attacks against U.S. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=74.8s)]
*  forces since October 17th, 2023. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=78.32s)]
*  So just just shy of a year. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=81.64s)]
*  One hundred and seventy five. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=84.24s)]
*  Obviously, we haven't responded to all of those attacks. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=86.24s)]
*  What should we be doing with all our troops? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=89.12s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot of bases and a lot of troops in harm's way with a lot of incoming, all of which most of almost all of which [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=91.84s)]
*  centered around proxies of Iran. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=99.4s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=102.08s)]
*  Yeah, again, Iran is who's behind all of this with their proxies, as you just mentioned. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=103.76s)]
*  But I think what we're doing is about right. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=109.67999999999999s)]
*  Any attacks against U.S. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=112.6s)]
*  troops is obviously unacceptable, but you still can't allow some small militia or some small proxy to draw the U.S. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=114.48s)]
*  into a wider Mideast war. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=122.56s)]
*  So when the attacks have gone to where U.S. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=125.12s)]
*  troops are hurt, the U.S. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=129.07999999999998s)]
*  responds and the U.S. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=131.4s)]
*  has increased its posture, defense posture and offensive capability in the region most recently since the killing of the Hamas leader. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=133.12s)]
*  General, do you share? I've got a lot of concern about those troops in on those bases because this is open source stuff. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=142.51999999999998s)]
*  None of this is classified. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=147.76s)]
*  Their air defense systems in some of those cases are not as robust as we would think. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=149.76s)]
*  And with the sophisticated drone technology that our adversaries now have, there's real if Iran wanted to kill U.S. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=153.6s)]
*  service members in the region on one of those bases, they probably could. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=160.28s)]
*  They've held back so far, but they could. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=163.88s)]
*  Do you have concern about the troops on the ground? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=165.88s)]
*  Oh, absolutely have concerns. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=169.08s)]
*  However, we know that the defense posture has been increased, especially since we lost the three soldiers in Jordan from a drone attack. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=171.12s)]
*  So the air defense capabilities, the awareness, the working with the regional allies and our own central command, as you know, has increased. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=182.24s)]
*  There we go. Major General Dana Fattard, maybe I'll see you in the Hudson next year. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=193.04s)]
*  Not this year, maybe next year. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=196.88s)]
*  Thank you, sir. Thank you, Pete. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2waEhDejW9c&t=198.52s)]
