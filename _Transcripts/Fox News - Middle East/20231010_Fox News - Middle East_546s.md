# Israeli man's daughter killed as they spoke on phone
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs)
*  We've seen the disturbing scenes of terrorists [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=0.0s)]
*  ripping innocent civilians from their homes [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  and the scores of civilian bodies [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=4.64s)]
*  being recovered from Southern towns. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=6.88s)]
*  We're now bringing in Elan Tron, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=9.58s)]
*  an Israeli scholar and retired Brandeis University professor [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=11.3s)]
*  whose daughter Debbie was killed by Hamas terrorists. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=15.52s)]
*  He was on the phone with her [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=19.94s)]
*  the moment that she was shot and killed. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=21.66s)]
*  Our hearts break for you [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=24.64s)]
*  and we are so sorry for your unfathomable loss. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=25.88s)]
*  Can you share with us your experience? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=28.9s)]
*  Yes, thank you. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=32.34s)]
*  Let me just say something. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=34.62s)]
*  I've been listening to the program. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=36.1s)]
*  I remember learning the expression [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=38.18s)]
*  of war to end all wars. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=40.42s)]
*  Don't think of this as a conflict [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=43.26s)]
*  that can be readily ended once and for all. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=45.84s)]
*  The forces against it are so deep, so fanatical [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=49.34s)]
*  that that's not the possibility. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  This thing was planned for months and months and months. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=58.12s)]
*  The timing of it may have been somehow pre-understood. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=62.04s)]
*  It may also be accidental, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=67.56s)]
*  but know that it had to come [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=69.72s)]
*  and that relates to the way in which my daughter died, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=72.32s)]
*  my son-in-law died, and the 900 and plus people have died [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=75.6s)]
*  and the people who have been taking hostages. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=80.16s)]
*  This was thoroughly planned and expected [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=82.52s)]
*  and the Hamas have great experience in taking hostages [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=87.84s)]
*  as do the Iranians. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=90.72s)]
*  Jimmy Carter ought to know that. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=92.64s)]
*  So do we as Americans in terms of what happened in Iraq [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=95.02000000000001s)]
*  and Somalia and so on. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=99.52000000000001s)]
*  To your question, we were on the phone with her [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=102.48s)]
*  because she called us up at around 6.30 in the morning. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=105.9s)]
*  When we began getting our pings on the phone, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=110.60000000000001s)]
*  we have a special app that tells us [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=113.54s)]
*  when rockets are coming our way. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=115.98s)]
*  We live in the Negev on the other side of Be'er Sheva, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=118.26s)]
*  45 seconds away from normal rocket fire from Gaza. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=121.86s)]
*  That means 45 seconds to descend [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=127.32000000000001s)]
*  to our reinforced concrete shelter. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=130.72s)]
*  Now know that we have a shelter, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=134.7s)]
*  but everybody else in the neighborhood [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=136.64000000000001s)]
*  and indeed in this city has a shelter. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=139.02s)]
*  So do the universities, the churches, even the mosques [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=140.96s)]
*  because we expect that we will be someday [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  under this kind of attack. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=149.88s)]
*  Deborah or Debbie informed us [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=152.22s)]
*  that she was hearing glass shattering [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=155.48000000000002s)]
*  and she had told us that she could hear Arabic [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=157.94s)]
*  being spoken in the neighborhood around the house [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=160.44s)]
*  and that there was firing. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  That was the last communication. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=164.88s)]
*  What then happened, we learned from our grandson. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=167.52s)]
*  Our grandson was in their safe room [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  together with Deborah's husband, our son-in-law Shlomi. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=173.36s)]
*  And they thought they try to secure themselves. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=178.76s)]
*  What they didn't know, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=181.84s)]
*  even after they pushed furniture against the door [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=183.74s)]
*  and locked the doors and locked the windows, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=186.48000000000002s)]
*  was that the terrorists came prepared [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=189.18s)]
*  with explosive devices to blow open the door, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=191.74s)]
*  to blow open the door to the safe room. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=195.12s)]
*  I just give you one example to give you a sense [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=198.44s)]
*  for the degree to which they were prepared [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=201.14000000000001s)]
*  and the degree to which they were insistent [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=205.38s)]
*  on murdering people. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=207.74s)]
*  We lost contact with our daughter as she was killed, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=210.54s)]
*  of course, but we were on the cell phone [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=214.34s)]
*  with our son for nearly 12 hours. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=216.94s)]
*  In fact, this was the most unusual kind of conflict [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=219.86s)]
*  which Americans have never fought. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=222.74s)]
*  As Americans, we fight conflicts [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=225.82s)]
*  where there's a front and where there's a rear. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=227.94s)]
*  In this conflict, all of us were involved. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=231.51999999999998s)]
*  Everybody has a cell phone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  We were on the cell phone with our grandson [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=236.2s)]
*  throughout his entire captivity [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=239.28s)]
*  until he was released by the IDF nearly 12 hours later. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=241.64s)]
*  So that we were able to share advice to him. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=247.51999999999998s)]
*  Hide, keep quiet, don't use the phone, text. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=252.16s)]
*  And we created a nationwide system of experts [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=257.18s)]
*  to help this young man out. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=261.26000000000005s)]
*  There were physicians that helped him inspect his wound [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=263.18s)]
*  for a bullet passed through his parents [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=267.98s)]
*  who pushed him down, covered his body, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=270.3s)]
*  and buffered the bullet as it entered into his abdomen, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=273.14000000000004s)]
*  ensuring that it wouldn't go too far. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=279.02000000000004s)]
*  Unfortunately, it didn't touch a vital organ [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=281.34000000000003s)]
*  and he survived. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=283.90000000000003s)]
*  He's in a hospital nearby now. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=285.02000000000004s)]
*  In short, he was in a situation [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=288.06s)]
*  where he had to devise instantaneously a strategy [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=292.02000000000004s)]
*  to survive a well-planned attack [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=295.54s)]
*  by people who were convinced of being murders. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=299.3s)]
*  When we met with him that night at the hospital [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=301.58000000000004s)]
*  in Beersheba, he was gray black, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=304.5s)]
*  meaning he was covered with gray black soot [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=307.58000000000004s)]
*  because after inspecting or walking around the house [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=310.74s)]
*  several times to see if anybody was still alive, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=313.96s)]
*  they still weren't satisfied. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=317.24s)]
*  So they set fire to all the houses in this neighborhood [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=319.36s)]
*  with the expectation that if anybody survived, [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=322.84s)]
*  they would come running out and then they would shoot him. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=325.84s)]
*  They didn't wanna miss anybody. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=328.88s)]
*  This was part of the plan. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=330.86s)]
*  Now, this is not military, classical military planning. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=332.64s)]
*  This is planning that is designed to murder civilians. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=336.74s)]
*  And that's what they have done. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=341.96s)]
*  They knew what they were doing. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=344.5s)]
*  This is not a war to end all wars. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=345.34000000000003s)]
*  They have a sense and empowerment by a deviant [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=348.26000000000005s)]
*  and misguided theology where they believe [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=352.66s)]
*  they're acting out divine will. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=357.26000000000005s)]
*  That's not all Muslims. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=361.1s)]
*  It's not all Arabs. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=362.70000000000005s)]
*  Sadat came to make peace. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=364.98s)]
*  We have peace with the Hashemites, with Hussein. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=366.98s)]
*  We have the Abraham Accords with the Emirates. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=370.85999999999996s)]
*  We have within Israel in the last government, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  there was an Arab who was a minister. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=378.02s)]
*  Half the pharmacists in Israel are now Arabs. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=382.09999999999997s)]
*  20 plus percent of the students [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=384.82s)]
*  at the Haifa Technion are Arabs. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=386.7s)]
*  The heads of departments at my university are Arabs. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=389.46s)]
*  We work, our children went to a joint Arab Jewish school [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=392.7s)]
*  where the languages of instruction were Arabic and Hebrew [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=397.44s)]
*  in the hope that somehow that would create [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=402.14s)]
*  better understanding, enable us to live in a region [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=405.06s)]
*  that through the centuries has been polyglot, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=408.94s)]
*  contained many different kinds of cultures. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=412.46s)]
*  So this is a war that was designed by a fanatical group, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=415.56s)]
*  not intending, I'll stop, not intent upon ending a war [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=420.7s)]
*  except with total victory [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=425.84s)]
*  and the destruction of the Jewish state. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=427.88s)]
*  Mr. Trone, what communication, if any, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=430.96s)]
*  have you received from the Israeli government? [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=432.88s)]
*  And what do you expect to hear or hope to hear [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=435.92s)]
*  from our President Biden in an hour? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=438.88s)]
*  I can tell you that the American Embassy [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=443.08s)]
*  got in touch with us. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=445.44s)]
*  Deborah was born in Boone County, Missouri [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=447.48s)]
*  when I was teaching at the University of Missouri. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  Other children of ours were born in Cook County, Missouri [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=452.9s)]
*  when I was a student at the University of Chicago. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=456.15999999999997s)]
*  So Americans wanted to know what is the safety [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=459.56s)]
*  of citizens in Israel. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=464.12s)]
*  From the state of Israel, we have heard nothing [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=467.47999999999996s)]
*  about the children or about the war [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=470.2s)]
*  because they are inundated with an extraordinary situation. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=474.35999999999996s)]
*  We know our daughter and son-in-law are dead. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=479.66s)]
*  We cannot have a funeral because we have not been able, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=483.26s)]
*  or the government has not been able to cope [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=487.74s)]
*  with such a large number of bodies. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=491.06s)]
*  The process of identification and burial [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=493.62s)]
*  is gonna take some time. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=496.7s)]
*  And I have to tell you, it is a terrible state to be in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=498.02000000000004s)]
*  where you know that a loved person is deceased, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=501.42s)]
*  but you can't engage in the process of closure. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=505.76s)]
*  And we don't know when that will take place. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=509.84s)]
*  We expect our government is very busy. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=513.4s)]
*  It's doing what it can. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=515.4s)]
*  This is unprecedented. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=516.48s)]
*  Mr. Terrone, our deepest sympathies and prayers. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=519.04s)]
*  We stand in solidarity with you and your family. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=522.88s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=525.76s)]
*  And Israel. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=526.58s)]
*  I know. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=527.76s)]
*  More to come. Thank you. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xJlqQgKBRzs&t=528.88s)]
