# Israel should be given the time it needs without handcuffs: Amb David Friedman
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8)
*  Bring in David Freeman. He's a former U.S. ambassador to Israel, and it's really good to see you this morning. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=0.0s)]
*  Can you tell us if there is any truth to reports that the U.S. is privately pushing Israel not to [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=5.44s)]
*  initiate war with Hezbollah as the northern border fighting intensifies? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=12.16s)]
*  Well, Dana, thanks for having me. Look, I'm hearing that from sources. I haven't heard it from [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=18.96s)]
*  the ultimate sources, but it's of some concern, I'll tell you why. And I should say that the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=24.72s)]
*  Biden administration over the last 12, 13 days has been great. Bringing in the carriers, great. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=31.36s)]
*  Warning Lebanon, warning Hezbollah, warning Iran, great. Coming here, President Biden coming to [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=38.32s)]
*  Israel, where I am, 6,000-mile trip for just to give a hug, a real hug to the Jewish people, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=45.68s)]
*  you know, very, very important. But signaling that Israel's handcuffed in Lebanon is sort of where I [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=52.160000000000004s)]
*  would find some criticism, because as long as Hezbollah hears, and they're definitely hearing [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  it from multiple sources, that Israel is not able to engage in a preemptive strike, because that's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=64.72s)]
*  the consideration, if you will, for the Gerald Ford and the Dwight Eisenhower, these two carrier [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=71.36s)]
*  strike forces being in the region. As long as Hezbollah hears that, they have no incentive [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  to stop this low-intensity war, which low intensity is a great term, but people are dying, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=81.2s)]
*  people are getting killed. And this low intensity could turn into a high-intensity battle in a [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=87.2s)]
*  second if some significant loss of life occurs. So I wish that the Biden administration would just [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=92.0s)]
*  give unqualified, unequivocal support to Israel to defend itself as it sees fit. I don't think [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=99.36s)]
*  Israel would do anything that would start a massive war without clearing it first with America. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=106.16s)]
*  But at least don't telegraph the fact that Israel is limited in the North, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=109.92s)]
*  because I think that's perpetuating this battle that's potentially very lethal. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=113.84s)]
*  What can you say about any possible sort of disagreements [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=118.56s)]
*  within the Israeli cabinet about what to do next? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  I don't think there are disagreements per se. Twelve days ago, this was not on the agenda, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=128.56s)]
*  and now you have the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=136.08s)]
*  And the effort to go in and obliterate Hamas is a worthy goal and an important goal, and I [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=140.48s)]
*  believe it will occur. But the method of doing that, when do you go in? And, Dana, I think here's [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=147.36s)]
*  the key point. When people ask me, what can America do for Israel, just give it time, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=154.64s)]
*  because if the military is calibrating its military response by a function of how much [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=160.32s)]
*  time they have, if they have to act quickly before they lose American support, they're going to move [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=165.52s)]
*  in too quickly. I think it's going to jeopardize any rescue of the hostages, and I think it's going [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=170.08s)]
*  to result in unnecessary loss of life, both for Israel and for the Palestinians. So Israel should [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=175.12s)]
*  just be given the time it needs, you know, without handcuffs, to rid out Hamas. I think that's the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=180.56s)]
*  most important thing America can give Israel right now. It has only been 12 days, and people need to [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=187.20000000000002s)]
*  remember that. This takes time and care, as I know they're taking. My last question to you has to do [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=192.16s)]
*  with the president's speech tonight. As I recall from my time at the White House, that for any [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=197.12s)]
*  president, you're always speaking to several audiences all at once. Of course, there's your [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=201.68s)]
*  domestic audience. There are also your allies, such as Israel in this case, but there's also your [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=205.84s)]
*  enemies. What will you be most interested to hear from the president tonight in his prime time [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=211.68s)]
*  address for the audience there in Israel? Well, look, I think the ultimate enemy here is Iran. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=216.8s)]
*  I think Iran has its fingerprints on all these incursions. Hamas, Hezbollah, they're the leading [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=223.92000000000002s)]
*  state sponsor of terrorism. The president has, I think, been too charitable to Iran over the last [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=230.8s)]
*  three years. Their oil sales have gone from, you know, $7 million in the last year of our [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=237.36s)]
*  administration, $7 billion, to now $42 billion a year, you know, in 2022. I hope he stops it. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=243.28s)]
*  I hope he freezes the $6 billion. I hope he reinforces the sanctions, brings back the old [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=250.48s)]
*  sanctions, because at the end of the day, the messaging to Iran is the most important international [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=255.44s)]
*  message that the president can deliver. Ambassador Friedman, thank you. We'll be in touch. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMGacNMVuN8&t=260.24s)]
