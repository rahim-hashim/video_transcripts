# 300 more US troops deployed to Middle East
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I)
*  The Pentagon is deploying 300 more troops to the Mideast as U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=0.0s)]
*  attack, get this, 27 times in the past two weeks, 27 times in two weeks, and we know [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  the Iranian proxies, they've told us already. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=10.120000000000001s)]
*  Now let's take a look at where the U.S. troops are roughly stationed as of right now. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  These are where we are at. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=17.78s)]
*  These are the attacks that have taken place, the 27 here. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=19.26s)]
*  These are the contractors, 45,000 are in this region. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=22.96s)]
*  This is where we are. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=28.38s)]
*  The naval bases are. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=29.98s)]
*  These are destroyers, aircraft carriers in the region ready to attack should other nations [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=31.5s)]
*  get involved in the Israeli war. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=36.48s)]
*  And let's take a look at where our troops are deployed. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=38.82s)]
*  A total of 45,000. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=41.62s)]
*  The ones that concern me most, concern us most because they're under attack the most [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=43.58s)]
*  is Syria and Iraq. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=46.9s)]
*  But keep in mind too when this is, these are the areas of major concern. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  But keep in mind, we got 13,000 in Kuwait. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=54.3s)]
*  You can hit Kuwait. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=57.34s)]
*  Bahrain, which is part of the Abraham Accords, you wouldn't think it would be attacked, but [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=58.34s)]
*  if you attack American assets, you'd be looking at somebody who was attacking for Hamas. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  Qatar is a bit dicey. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=66.58s)]
*  That's what we know, that the higher-ups in Hamas actually live a luxurious life, have [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=68.74000000000001s)]
*  their limousines and have their four seasons. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=73.02000000000001s)]
*  And the UAE, 3,500 troops. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=76.02000000000001s)]
*  We have a lot of assets in this area, a lot of reasons to be concerned, and ultimately [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=78.94s)]
*  this is the most concerned. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=84.98s)]
*  37 attacks, we responded once. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=86.5s)]
*  With me right now is retired Navy SEAL and recon Marine Corps veteran Mike Cirelli. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=89.02s)]
*  He joins us. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=93.42s)]
*  Mike, how frustrated would you be knowing that you've been under rocket attack for the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=94.42s)]
*  last three or four weeks and you were told basically don't do anything. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=98.74s)]
*  We'll knock them out of the sky, you'll be okay. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=103.78s)]
*  Meanwhile, we got a couple of dozen that were hit and a contract to the tide of a heart [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=106.14s)]
*  attack. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=110.34s)]
*  So Brian, as a ground troop, I can only believe that they are extremely frustrated. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=112.34s)]
*  I understand that the U.S. is showing restraint in order to prevent this becoming a broader [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=118.46000000000001s)]
*  open conflict within the Middle East. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  But if an American service member is killed or maimed, the U.S. has no other recourse [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=126.30000000000001s)]
*  but to retaliate against Iran with extreme prejudice. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=133.18s)]
*  We know our guys are just sitting here. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=138.5s)]
*  We have a lot of people in this area, in Iraq. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=140.98s)]
*  We know in Syria we've got 900 guys just sitting there. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=144.01999999999998s)]
*  We hit a weapons depot. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=146.85999999999999s)]
*  So our guys are just sitting there knowing there's a problem here, there's a problem [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=148.5s)]
*  here and there's a war raging there. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=152.33999999999997s)]
*  They know they're under attack. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=155.45999999999998s)]
*  How much missile defense do these bases have? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=157.38s)]
*  The bases are probably well armed in defense of any indirect fires coming in. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=160.66s)]
*  But again, that said, for a ground troop, a young sergeant in the Marine Corps sitting [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=167.58s)]
*  there, it's sort of antithesis to their existence in that if somebody throws a punch at you, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=172.5s)]
*  you retaliate back swiftly and very determinedly. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=178.9s)]
*  So Michael, you're in Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=183.62s)]
*  All of a sudden you realize Hezbollah might want to get involved. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=185.7s)]
*  We see some consistent rocket attacks and some retaliation. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=188.14s)]
*  We realize Hezbollah assets in Syria, some rocket attacks and retaliation. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=191.02s)]
*  And then over the last few days, guess who else gets involved? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=195.28s)]
*  The Houthi rebels. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=198.36s)]
*  They're declaring war on Israel. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=199.36s)]
*  How do you game plan this out knowing different fronts are opening up by the hour? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=201.36s)]
*  Well, I think the question everyone's asking is this the first domino with Yemen declaring [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=207.12s)]
*  war on Israel to a open, broader conflict? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=212.72s)]
*  Remember, Yemen's been at civil war since 2014 when the Houthis removed Hadi, President [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=216.76s)]
*  Hadi, who then fled to Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=222.16s)]
*  Now, the Houthis are a jihadist organization backed by Iran. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=225.32s)]
*  And quite frankly, they were on the terror watch list until February of 2021 when the [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=229.56s)]
*  Biden administration removed them. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  But I think for Saudi Arabian UAE, who were actively involved in Yemen, basically due [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=236.88s)]
*  to Iranian influence, this doesn't mean state to state warfare. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=244.16s)]
*  They'll most likely do clandestine and indirect operations, as well as economic sanctions [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  to limit Iran's influence or broadening the conflict further. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=253.16s)]
*  So Iran did war games a week ago, at which time they're rolling out tanks that we gave [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=257.71999999999997s)]
*  them in 1978. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=262.6s)]
*  They have some weapons, they have some assets, but they're not a sophisticated army. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=264.4s)]
*  Everybody you mentioned have one thing in common. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=268.96s)]
*  Iran, how much longer are we going to pretend? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=272.28s)]
*  It's not Saudi Arabia that's the problem. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=274.88s)]
*  It's not Oman that's the problem. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=276.56s)]
*  It is Iran that's the problem. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=278.68s)]
*  Sooner or later, we're going to have to say it out loud. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=280.72s)]
*  Any final thought, Mike? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=282.88s)]
*  I'll tell you this. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=284.88s)]
*  Iran knows they can't win in open conflict against the U.S. and Arab states. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  So they will continue with the indirect and clandestine warfare supporting these jihadist [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=291.56s)]
*  organizations. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=295.4s)]
*  But Iran has to be dealt with. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=296.64s)]
*  And quite frankly, we allowed their oil exports to increase from about $5 billion to $40 billion [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=298.03999999999996s)]
*  over the last years. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  Those economic sanctions need to be reimposed and crippling. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=304.15999999999997s)]
*  And diplomacy ultimately by the Gulf states to end their influence. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=308.76s)]
*  As much as they were enriching, that's a problem. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=312.28s)]
*  They were in a box. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=314.03999999999996s)]
*  They are not in a box now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=315.28s)]
*  Mike, thanks so much. Appreciate it. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1aaKMcDmK6I&t=316.67999999999995s)]
