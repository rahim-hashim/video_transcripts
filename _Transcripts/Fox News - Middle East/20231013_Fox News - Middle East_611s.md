# John Kirby: We are watching the $6B to Iran ‘like a hawk’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8)
*  So these are called day of rage protests, which I have mentioned. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=0.0s)]
*  A hundred, excuse me, 14 Americans are still missing in Israel and assumed many of them [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=5.0s)]
*  to be held hostage. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=12.4s)]
*  We don't know how many of them will be discovered or who many of them may have been lost. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=13.88s)]
*  Not an exact number on those being held. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=19.72s)]
*  But the White House says that President Biden has been meeting today virtually with the [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=22.32s)]
*  families of those Americans who are being held. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=27.86s)]
*  A short time ago, I spoke with John Kirby, National Security Council coordinator for [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=31.3s)]
*  strategic communications. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=35.62s)]
*  Here's that John. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=38.06s)]
*  Thank you very much for being here. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=40.2s)]
*  I know obviously there's a lot going on. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=41.62s)]
*  It's good to have you with us this afternoon. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=44.14s)]
*  What can you tell us about these phone calls that the president is having with these families [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=45.7s)]
*  of the hostages? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=50.8s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Martha, for having me. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=52.14s)]
*  It was basically a Zoom call that he had today. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=54.46s)]
*  He was also joined by the national security adviser and our special envoy for hostage [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=58.22s)]
*  affairs, Roger Carstens. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=62.300000000000004s)]
*  But it was a Zoom call with some of the families of those who are unaccounted for. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=64.26s)]
*  That was really the population of the families. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=69.8s)]
*  They were, as you might imagine, they're scattered all over the place, which is why we did it [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=71.86s)]
*  virtually. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  It was a chance for the president to tell them, make sure they heard directly from him [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  that we're doing everything we can to try to get answers. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=80.26s)]
*  We know they've got questions. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=83.14s)]
*  We do, too. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=84.26s)]
*  We're really trying to figure out where these folks are and if they're still alive, what [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=85.26s)]
*  condition they're in, how we can help them. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=89.46000000000001s)]
*  So it was a heartwarming moment for the president, and I believe the families appreciated the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=91.5s)]
*  outreach. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=96.34s)]
*  I'm sure they did. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=97.34s)]
*  So there's some reporting that Iran is watching closely to see how Israel acts in Gaza and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=98.34s)]
*  that if they see fit or they see a need, then they will open up that northern front on the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=107.02s)]
*  Hezbollah side as well. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=113.82s)]
*  So that's suggesting that if they don't see what they would consider to be appropriate [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=116.34s)]
*  restraint by Israel, that they're sort of hanging that over their head in terms of opening [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=120.66s)]
*  another front in the north. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=126.42s)]
*  What do you say to that? [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=128.5s)]
*  Well, I can't confirm the reports that Iran feels that way. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=129.5s)]
*  I mean, certainly they can speak for themselves on this, and I have no doubt that they are [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=134.02s)]
*  watching developments in Israel very closely given the longstanding support that they've [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=137.78s)]
*  given to Hezbollah and to Hamas. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=141.82000000000002s)]
*  I would just reiterate what the secretary of defense said when he was in Tel Aviv today, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=144.58s)]
*  reiterating the president, that we take our national security interests seriously in the [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=149.02s)]
*  region and any actor, state or other actor, that wants to seek to widen and deepen this [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=153.18s)]
*  conflict and escalate it, our message is don't try it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=158.66000000000003s)]
*  We've got that extra carrier battle group, strike group in the eastern Mediterranean. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=163.34s)]
*  We've added other military assets to the region. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=167.26s)]
*  We take our national security interests seriously. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=171.3s)]
*  So one of the big questions I think that a lot of people have who are watching all of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=173.74s)]
*  this is why there appears to be a somewhat hesitant or curious deference to calling out [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=177.14000000000001s)]
*  Iran's involvement in this situation. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=187.02s)]
*  You have reports in the New York Times, you have reports from the Wall Street Journal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=189.9s)]
*  about direct involvement of Iran in the attack that happened almost a week ago. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=193.01999999999998s)]
*  And now how they're watching over all of this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=198.38s)]
*  Here's the former secretary of defense, Asper. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=200.78s)]
*  Watch this moments ago. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=203.62s)]
*  You know, Brett, it is puzzling that we had this report come out from Wall Street Journal [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=206.14s)]
*  on Sunday evening, last Sunday evening, saying that, you know, the IRGC plotted with Hezbollah [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=209.94s)]
*  and Hamas on the plans and that Tehran greenlighted it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=216.1s)]
*  And then we had this kind of conflicting, unconfirmed reporting coming from the administration [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=219.78s)]
*  that they can't ascertain that yet. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=225.74s)]
*  So he says that's puzzling. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=228.22s)]
*  John, what do you say to him? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=229.3s)]
*  I would tell the former secretary of defense that we're looking hard at the intel stream, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=231.18s)]
*  as you might expect that we are. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=235.38s)]
*  And even as you and I are speaking here, Martha, we just haven't seen any specific, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=238.10000000000002s)]
*  tangible intelligence that that leads us to the conclusion that the regime in Tehran was [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=242.18s)]
*  witting a resourced participant in these specific attacks. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=248.06s)]
*  But I also want to make it clear that we absolutely believe in the broad complicity of Iran here. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=251.78s)]
*  What's the difference, John? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=257.94s)]
*  What's the difference? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=259.54s)]
*  Without Iran, there would be no Hamas. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=260.94s)]
*  There would be no Hezbollah. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=263.38s)]
*  We understand that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=264.42s)]
*  But what I'm saying is we just we're looking at it and we haven't seen the direct the direct [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=265.74s)]
*  evidence. And if if people are looking for us to say, well, you got to hold Iran accountable, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=269.98s)]
*  I mean, my goodness, Martha, take a look at what we've done in just two and a half years, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=273.7s)]
*  more than 400 entities in Iran sanctioned. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=277.22s)]
*  Additionally, just by this administration, 300 of them in the last year. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=279.78000000000003s)]
*  Heck, we just did some a few weeks ago. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=283.86s)]
*  And some of that was directly tied to entities that support their support for terrorist [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=286.06s)]
*  networks. We boasted our military presence, not just in the eastern mid, but in the in [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=290.46s)]
*  the Gulf region as well. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=294.94s)]
*  We're keeping a close eye on Iran and we've sent a strong signal to Iran about their [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=296.54s)]
*  destabilizing activities. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=300.46s)]
*  And we're going to keep we're going to keep doing that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=302.34000000000003s)]
*  We're not taking any options off the table. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=303.78s)]
*  Despite that, though, John, you acknowledge that they're making more money on oil sales to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=305.42s)]
*  China than they have ever made billions of dollars in sales to China, the largest. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=309.62s)]
*  It's increased dramatically since 2018. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=316.3s)]
*  And then we have this issue. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=319.3s)]
*  And I know there's a lot of back and forth over this of the six billion dollars and why [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=320.66s)]
*  the White House can't just come forward and say that that money is absolutely not [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=325.94s)]
*  available, not that it hasn't been touched, but that if they were asked or requested, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=331.54s)]
*  it would be denied. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=336.74s)]
*  Yeah, we're watching that money like a hawk, as you might imagine, Martha. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=338.82s)]
*  And you're right. Not a dime of it has been spent. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=341.74s)]
*  And we're watching it very, very closely. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=344.18s)]
*  That's about as far as I'm going to go on that today. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=345.98s)]
*  And as for the oil revenues, we are enforcing sanctions and will continue to will obviously [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=348.26s)]
*  review the sanctions regime. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=353.58000000000004s)]
*  And if we have to change it and add to it, we'll we'll do that, too. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=354.74s)]
*  Most of the money that they're getting off of oil is through the black market. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=358.82000000000005s)]
*  They're trying to evade the sanctions enforcement in place. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=362.54s)]
*  And as you trade oil in the black market, your margins actually go down. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=365.38000000000005s)]
*  I'm not disputing the numbers that they're not not saying they're not getting money off [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=369.26000000000005s)]
*  oil, but it's becoming increasingly difficult for them. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=372.34000000000003s)]
*  So why not say that they are not they will not be permitted to tap into any of the six [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=375.58000000000004s)]
*  billion rather than you're watching it? [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=381.3s)]
*  So that sounds like you could watch them come access some of it. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=383.14000000000004s)]
*  They haven't accessed a dime of it. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=387.74s)]
*  We're watching this very, very closely. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=389.86s)]
*  And I also think it's very important to remind that even if they did try, let's say they [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=391.26s)]
*  tried to access it last week, there was an approved transaction, right, approved [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=396.1s)]
*  transaction. It wouldn't be six billion. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=400.1s)]
*  It'd be something much smaller than that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=401.38s)]
*  What would happen is, Martha, that we would validate whether or not it was a sufficient [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=403.22s)]
*  and approved request, like for food, medicine, crops, that kind of thing. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=407.7s)]
*  And then we would select the vendors who would go buy that stuff and then ship it into a [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=412.34000000000003s)]
*  run directly through humanitarian organizations to get to the Iranian people. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=416.58s)]
*  The regime in Tehran would never see a dime of it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=420.41999999999996s)]
*  When we say access it, I want to make it clear to your viewers. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=423.21999999999997s)]
*  It's not like they get to cut a check and that the regime gets that money. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=425.9s)]
*  They never get it. And that is the exact same arrangement that Secretary Pompeo, when he [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=429.18s)]
*  was secretary of state, set up under the previous administration. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=433.5s)]
*  We didn't change those rules. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=436.34s)]
*  But that was before Hamas attacked Israel and Iran is now threatening it to Hezbollah [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=437.34s)]
*  to attack in the north. So that changes the game, right? [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=441.7s)]
*  So why not? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=444.62s)]
*  It feels that there's a reluctance to to step on the toes of Iran, John, in any way. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=445.78000000000003s)]
*  No, ma'am. No, ma'am. No, I'm sorry, Martha. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=452.26s)]
*  I just don't agree with that. Not at all. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=453.98s)]
*  So tell me why. Why shouldn't people read this that way? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=455.58s)]
*  Because I've gone through a lot of it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=459.06s)]
*  I mean, my goodness, we've issued 400 more sanctions against Iran. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=460.94s)]
*  We've improved and increased our military posture in the region. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=464.58s)]
*  We have responded swiftly when they attacked our troops in Iraq and Syria. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=468.62s)]
*  So to the degree where there hasn't been many attacks at all in recent months, we've [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=472.02000000000004s)]
*  got the longest truce ever in Yemen's history in terms of 15 months now of peace and [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=477.34000000000003s)]
*  security for the Yemeni people. Believe me, we are watching the Iran account very, very [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=482.66s)]
*  closely. We're not in discussions with them about the Iran deal anymore, since they [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=487.14000000000004s)]
*  weren't negotiating in good faith. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=490.42s)]
*  We are not losing sight of the threat that Iran poses. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=492.82s)]
*  OK, just very quickly, before I let you go, I know you have to go. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=496.42s)]
*  Concerns about safety here at home. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=500.09999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. You know, all of us have heard from college kids on campuses very nervous today [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=503.38s)]
*  about what could happen, whether or not a gunman is going to do something crazy and [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=507.5s)]
*  hurt people. We know that there's 151 on the terror watch list who are now somewhere [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=513.3s)]
*  in this country. And Fran Townsend, former Homeland Security adviser to President Bush, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=518.5s)]
*  said she finds what has happened at the border with regard to these missing individuals [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=523.74s)]
*  terrifying. How would you characterize it and what would your message to those college [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=528.38s)]
*  students be today? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=532.3s)]
*  Well, you and I have talked about this many, many times, so I won't reiterate it all [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=533.74s)]
*  again. I mean, obviously we take our domestic security concerns very, very seriously. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=536.98s)]
*  And you saw days ago the president announced that federal law enforcement and the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=541.86s)]
*  intelligence community was going to continue to work closely with state and local [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=547.02s)]
*  authorities, knowing that there could be spillover violence from what's going on [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=550.54s)]
*  between Hamas and Israel, both to the Jewish and the Muslim community here in the United [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=554.66s)]
*  States. And we're watching this closely. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=558.18s)]
*  We don't know. And this is a really important point to make. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=560.06s)]
*  We're not aware of any specific credible threats to any Americans right now as a result [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=562.74s)]
*  of what's going on between Israel and Hamas. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=567.06s)]
*  But we're not sitting on that. We're not taking it for granted. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=569.5799999999999s)]
*  We're working very, very hard to see if we can identify any threats and be able to [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=572.2199999999999s)]
*  disrupt them, whether you're in the Jewish community, the Muslim community or not. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=576.02s)]
*  Well, no matter who you are, you should be able to live and work and recreate in peace [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=580.86s)]
*  and security. And we're absolutely committed to that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=584.4200000000001s)]
*  We are definitely eyes on here and we're going to watch it very, very, very close. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=586.58s)]
*  All right, John Kirby, I appreciate your time as always. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7RNISl88f8&t=590.46s)]
