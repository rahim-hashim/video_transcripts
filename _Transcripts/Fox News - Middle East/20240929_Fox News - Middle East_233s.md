# Hassan Nasrallah would be alive if Israel agreed to Biden's cease-fire call: Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I)
*  Joining us now, former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Secretary, good to have you with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=0.0s)]
*  What do you make of what the Senator had to say about the fact that the Biden-Harris [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=4.24s)]
*  administration has been full-throated and unequivocal in supporting Israel? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=8.16s)]
*  Well, good morning, Shannon. Look, Senator Coons is a nice man, but he's just living in a fantasy [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=13.68s)]
*  world. The most important people who make the determination about whether America is providing [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=18.32s)]
*  enough support, frankly, are the Iranians, Hamas, and Hezbollah. And they have felt free to [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=23.28s)]
*  fire missiles into Israel, kill 1,200 Israelis, continuing to hold Americans hostage. We don't [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=29.279999999999998s)]
*  even talk about that anymore. There are still hostages held by the Iranian regime in Gaza today. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  Instead of talking about a ceasefire, which is what Secretary Austin spoke about, what Secretary [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=40.48s)]
*  Blinken speaks about, we should be saying plain and clear, finish the job. Nasrallah would be [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=44.72s)]
*  alive today if the Biden administration's ceasefire had gone into effect. The entire Hezbollah [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=50.56s)]
*  leadership would be alive today if the Israelis had agreed to the ceasefire that Hamas had demanded [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=55.28s)]
*  and that the Iranians had demanded and the United States had supported. Make no mistake about it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  We know history. We know the history from 1967. We know the history from 1973. There is only one [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=66.88s)]
*  thing that will protect Israel and make the Middle East more prosperous and peaceful, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=72.64s)]
*  and that is the demonstration of power and imposing costs on Israel's adversaries. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=77.84s)]
*  So there were reports in Axios earlier this week that Hezbollah had asked Iran to directly [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=83.19999999999999s)]
*  strike Israel. They didn't want to do that because their president was here speaking at the UN in the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=88.55999999999999s)]
*  U.S. Well, now there are questions about if Hezbollah is disabled, does Iran now move forward with that? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=92.63999999999999s)]
*  There's a quote by Atrida Parsi, the executive VP of the Quincy Institute here in Washington, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  talking about this, saying, if it becomes clear to Iran that Hezbollah actually cannot defend itself [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=103.67999999999999s)]
*  following the bombing in Beirut, then the Iranian justification for staying out of the war has [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=109.04s)]
*  collapsed. At that point, Iran's credibility with the rest of its partners in the access of regional [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=114.32000000000001s)]
*  militant groups will risk collapsing if Tehran does not react. Do you worry about where this [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=119.68s)]
*  has pushed Iran to and what happens next? Shannon, Atrida Parsi has been an Iranian [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=126.80000000000001s)]
*  sympathizer for a long time. He works closely alongside some of the leaders inside of the country. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=133.20000000000002s)]
*  The way to convince Iran to stay out of this conflict is to demonstrate that the [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=139.12s)]
*  Americans and the Israelis together can hold Iranian leadership to account, impose real costs [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=145.12s)]
*  on them. When they see the leadership of Hezbollah destroyed, when they see Hamas dismantled, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=151.2s)]
*  when they see the United States prepared to actually support that, and they see our Gulf [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=155.92s)]
*  partners recognize that they too can trust the United States of America, that's how you keep [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=160.39999999999998s)]
*  Iran at bay. It's how you push back against what, frankly, the Biden-Harris administration [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=165.68s)]
*  has allowed, the continuation of the Iranian nuclear program to build. There's only one way. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=169.68s)]
*  You have to put pressure on them. You have to deny them resources. You can't hand them billions of [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=174.8s)]
*  dollars and then tell the Israelis to stand down and have any prayer. Then not only will Israel do [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  well, but we shouldn't forget this. Hezbollah and Nasrallah killed more Muslims than just about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=184.88s)]
*  anybody else over the last decades. This is a regional challenge. It's one for the world, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=190.72s)]
*  and the United States demanding that Israel stop when the task ahead of them is to finish the job [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=196.4s)]
*  is a mistake and only creates further risk of escalation. It seemed wise for Prime Minister [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=201.6s)]
*  Netanyahu to speak at the UN about the people of Iran and people of Lebanon, the people who live [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=207.36s)]
*  in Gaza and wanting to rescue them from their oppressors too, to your point. Secretary, thank [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=212.48s)]
*  you. Thank you, Shannon. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMQeQ9Ig92I&t=218.4s)]
