# Former Afghan womenâ€™s soccer team captain describes escape to the UK
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 02, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc)
*  Welcome back. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=0.0s)]
*  An Afghan women's soccer team recently touching down in the UK after months of trying to escape [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=3.16s)]
*  the Taliban run country. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=8.66s)]
*  Former Afghan women's soccer captain Khalida Pappal played a key role in getting into safety [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=10.56s)]
*  and she joins me live. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=16.32s)]
*  First off, thank you for what you did. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=18.98s)]
*  You are a true hero. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=21.68s)]
*  How are the girls and their families doing right now? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=22.68s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=26.48s)]
*  They're doing fine. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=27.48s)]
*  We played first time after a long time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=28.96s)]
*  We played football together on a football pitch. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=32.24s)]
*  They were so happy and then afterwards we together with their families went to watch [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  the Leeds United and Crystal Palace game and Leeds United football club. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=40.88s)]
*  The families were so happy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=47.24s)]
*  This time they had the tears in their eyes. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=49.36s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=51.84s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=52.84s)]
*  There was a time though where they did not have tears of joy in their eyes. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=53.84s)]
*  Those tears were much different. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=57.28s)]
*  Tears of fear. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=59.2s)]
*  Tears of just pure brutality that they endured. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=60.56s)]
*  Can you describe what those girls and their families endured? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=63.6s)]
*  Yesterday I had a talk with them a little bit and then they start crying and they said [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=66.88s)]
*  one thing that was very painful. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=74.12s)]
*  They said we were training for a national cup to participate in a Central Asian Cup. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=76.6s)]
*  We were all prepared. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=85.12s)]
*  Our bags were packed to travel for the national team. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=86.52000000000001s)]
*  We had the last day of the training where the Taliban attacked and took over the city. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=91.52000000000001s)]
*  It was a nightmare that we had to leave everything and escape and hide. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=100.2s)]
*  Some of their families were brutally beaten. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  Some of their family members were taken by Taliban. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=110.64s)]
*  Their house was bombed down. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=113.80000000000001s)]
*  So they have been through a lot. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=117.4s)]
*  They are traumatized. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=119.04s)]
*  Their journey was not easy. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=122.2s)]
*  For many months they were on the way to make it to the UK. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=125.04s)]
*  Think about that for a moment. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=131.20000000000002s)]
*  Families brutalized because a group of girls want to play soccer. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=133.32s)]
*  That is horrific. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=137.52s)]
*  What was the reaction of the girls and their families when the US pulled out of Afghanistan? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=138.76s)]
*  It was a nightmare for so many people, especially for women of Afghanistan. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=144.76s)]
*  Because the women of Afghanistan are always the women and children, in general, good people, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=150.76s)]
*  are victims of long-term war in Afghanistan. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=158.35999999999999s)]
*  For example, when the Taliban arrived, the first thing they did, they took the right [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=162.76s)]
*  of education from people, from women, the right of having basic human rights, practicing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=167.84s)]
*  the basic human rights they took from them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=174.60000000000002s)]
*  The women who are after a long time of work and study and development, they were independent, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  but now they are back at home, housewives, that they are dependent on men. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=184.92000000000002s)]
*  They no longer can go to school, can go to work or sports. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=190.28s)]
*  Everything is taken from them. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=195.96s)]
*  And women who are activists, especially the footballers, who are activists and they were [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=198.24s)]
*  using their platform to raise awareness, to be the voice for voiceless sisters, their [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=204.24s)]
*  lives were in danger. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=210.32s)]
*  Did the girls and their families feel like America betrayed them? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=213.04s)]
*  When the international community got out of Afghanistan, the first call I had with the [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=219.2s)]
*  footballers in Afghanistan, with female footballers, they said, our countrymen betrayed us, the [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=226.0s)]
*  world betrayed us, the world let us fall in the hand of enemy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=234.0s)]
*  We did everything possible to participate actively in the society, but we have no more [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=240.2s)]
*  protection. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=246.32s)]
*  The show is over. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=247.32s)]
*  Everybody is going home and we are left in the street. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=249.56s)]
*  Let's switch to the positive part of this, the work of getting these girls and their [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=252.44s)]
*  families out. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=256.04s)]
*  It was an odd coalition of teammates that came together. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=257.04s)]
*  You had rabbis, you had Kim Kardashian, but at the end of the day, it was you. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  How did you pull this off? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=264.36s)]
*  It was so difficult, so difficult to get people together to support, but also to take the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=265.56s)]
*  risk and the leadership to lead 132 people to cross the border, to take one step after [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=274.8s)]
*  another, but also coordinate with the different partners to support the team. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=284.08s)]
*  But I'm so happy, we are very lucky, that great people, great-minded people came together [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=290.72s)]
*  without thinking of like a family. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=297.72s)]
*  They supported this team and together we made this possible. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=302.08s)]
*  Was there a time where you thought you couldn't pull this off? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=308.8s)]
*  Yes, I remember when our first mission failed, when the team was on the way to the airport [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=311.47999999999996s)]
*  and they were supposed to go to Qatar and the explosion happened at the airport and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=321.79999999999995s)]
*  We had to call them and they had to get off the bus and we had to find another solution. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=329.40000000000003s)]
*  I remember I hung the phone and I sat and cried and I didn't know how to get them out. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=336.0s)]
*  It was so difficult and I felt so hopeless thinking they are waiting for me, they are [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=342.76s)]
*  waiting for my call to give them the next direction, next lead. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=349.68s)]
*  And as a leader, I don't know what to do. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=354.72s)]
*  I don't know the direction. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=356.56s)]
*  Everything seems like, stop, the country closed and I cannot get them out. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=358.52s)]
*  But everything changed again. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=363.32s)]
*  But you did it. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=365.0s)]
*  You did it. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=367.0s)]
*  At the end of the day, you did it. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=368.0s)]
*  And you've given these girls and their families hope for a future, a hope that they did not [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=369.4s)]
*  have about three months ago. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=373.48s)]
*  Kalida Pappal, an amazing story, an amazing lady you are. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=375.52s)]
*  Thank you for what you did and thank you for joining us this morning. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQ629ARICTc&t=379.32s)]
