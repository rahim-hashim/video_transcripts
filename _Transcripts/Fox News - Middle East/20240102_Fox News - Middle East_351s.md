# Israel takes out top Hamas official in Beirut: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw)
*  Trey Yanks live for us on the ground in Tel Aviv Trey. Thank you. Let's bring in general Jack Keene retired four-star general and Fox News senior [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=0.0s)]
*  Strategic analyst general. It's great to have you on Trey makes a very good point there [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=7.5600000000000005s)]
*  He's talking about the Hamas leader and the relationship that he has with the leader of Hezbollah Hassan Nasrallah [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=11.96s)]
*  And Nasrallah is now warning that that you know killing this Hamas leader will no doubt lead to an [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=18.400000000000002s)]
*  Escalation of the war do you think that's you think that's fair? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=25.52s)]
*  Well, I certainly we've seen the escalation of the war unfold right between our eyes here given [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=31.0s)]
*  Hezbollah's own escalation of it in the northern part of [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=37.68s)]
*  Israel they haven't unleashed certainly what their center of gravity is the hundreds of thousands of rockets and missiles they have they can reach every [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=41.64s)]
*  Major city and town in Israel that has not happened [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  But we've watched Iran who's at war in the Middle East with Israel and with the United States and they're using their proxies to do it [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=53.839999999999996s)]
*  Have expanded the war certainly they have managed to shut down a lot of the traffic that goes through the Suez Canal [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=62.0s)]
*  By virtue of the Red Sea with the harassment of that trafficking and the attacks they've made against the United States and just shipping [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=68.12s)]
*  in general, so yeah [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=76.0s)]
*  We've been taking leaders out for years and they and they do get replaced but nonetheless [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=78.0s)]
*  This is a prominent leader and I think Israel is putting on notice [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=83.96s)]
*  They're certainly after the tactical and operational commanders inside of Gaza and they've killed a number of those and there's top leaders there that they're in [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=87.8s)]
*  Search of particularly to DF and Sinwa [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=96.16s)]
*  And they've killed a number of those and there's top leaders there that they're in search of particularly to DF and Sinwa [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=99.96000000000001s)]
*  And Sinwa, but this is a political leader more than a military commander and that puts on notice the entire [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=106.88s)]
*  Political regime to include those who are in Qatar who we've seen on television many times who obviously approved [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=114.08s)]
*  The attack on Israel. I don't see them being attacked by Israel until the hostage situation is resolved [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=121.36s)]
*  But likely once that is resolved one way or the other they're going into hiding the Israelis have this John [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=128.16s)]
*  They have a history of tracking down [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=134.28s)]
*  Leaders who have done harm to their people and they don't give up till they find those leaders [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=136.96s)]
*  We have the same history and they're very good at it [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=142.28s)]
*  It's interesting general you talk about in Gaza Israel IDF forces going in looking for some more Hamas leaders at the very same time [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=145.56s)]
*  We're hearing reports that the Israeli War Cabinet [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=152.92s)]
*  Looking for ways to to lower the fighting level [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=155.12s)]
*  Maybe kind of try to get the get the Gaza fighting down to a low level in the coming weeks [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=159.0s)]
*  Do you think they're looking for a way to end this conflict? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=164.68s)]
*  Well if they end this conflict soon [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=171.4s)]
*  they're gonna hand a [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=174.0s)]
*  strategic victory to Hamas because it will not be destroyed as leadership will not be destroyed and [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=175.52s)]
*  Focusing just on leaders listen from 2003 to 2006. We'd largely focused on leaders inside of Iraq [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=181.28s)]
*  We used our soft guys to do what we call the high-value targets the war increased in intensity [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=188.76s)]
*  The violence increased every single year [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=194.12s)]
*  It was not until we brought in conventional forces to so-called surge and when after the al-qaeda [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=196.32s)]
*  network its support zones and began to systematically dismantle it [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=203.28s)]
*  Enabled by what our soft guys were doing with high-value targets [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=208.07999999999998s)]
*  Then the the whole system worked if these if the Israelis walk away [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=212.24s)]
*  From killing the fighters from taking down the infrastructure in their support zones and just focus on on the leaders [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=217.27999999999997s)]
*  I think they're gonna hand a victory to Hamas. Yeah, we've got about a minute left general [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=223.92s)]
*  I want to get your take on Iran now sending a warship an old warship [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=228.76s)]
*  Mind you to the Red Sea to respond to these US strikes. What do you think? [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=232.48s)]
*  Well, I think it's you know more show of force than than anything else [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=239.6s)]
*  I mean no warship that that the Iranians can produce is a threat to to us out there [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=244.72s)]
*  I mean this listen the Iranians by and large a winning is that this expansion here half of the shipping is shut down [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=250.0s)]
*  They're not going through the Suez Canal. That's it. That's impacting a global supply chain [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=257.72s)]
*  I think we've all seen the issue here. It's pretty simple [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=261.84s)]
*  It's not enough to just defend attacks against the shipping [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=266.56s)]
*  You have to go to the source of the attacks and then you should also go to the source of who's directing the attacks [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=270.24s)]
*  So the source of the attacks rockets and missiles [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=276.16s)]
*  Etc that the Houthi zone and then the Iranians who were who had directed and facilitating this proxy war [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=279.08000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, just so you're clear. You're talking about going after Iran [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=285.44000000000005s)]
*  You think it's time to go after Iran to make it very clear to them [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=289.12s)]
*  No, two to three months ago. We should have done that. We should have gone after the IRGC training center [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=293.44000000000005s)]
*  IRGC support structures [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  IRGC bases these are the people that are that are focusing and supporting [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  All of the proxy elements that are operating Iran has declared a war in the Middle East here [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=307.52000000000004s)]
*  And they're trying not to be directly involved with their own forces [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=312.6s)]
*  But they're using the proxies to do it and we're not holding them accountable. We have difficulty even mentioning their name [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=316.12s)]
*  I mean, I think strategically that's a huge failure [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=322.36s)]
*  General Jack Keene great to have you on sir. Thank you [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=326.72s)]
*  Yeah, great talking to trace I went on Brian kill me I want you to do me a favor [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s03GaICpbDw&t=330.84000000000003s)]
