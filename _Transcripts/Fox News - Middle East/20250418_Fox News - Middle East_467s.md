# Trump has given Iran a very simple 'ultimatum,' Jack Keane warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM)
*  I wouldn't say waved off. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not in a rush to do it because I think that Iran has a chance to have a great country [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=3.12s)]
*  and to live happily without death. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=9.0s)]
*  And I'd like to see that. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=12.96s)]
*  That's my first option. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=13.96s)]
*  If there's a second option, I think it would be very bad for Iran. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=16.68s)]
*  And I think Iran is wanting to talk. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=22.12s)]
*  I hope they're wanting to talk. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=26.12s)]
*  It's going to be very good for them if they do. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=27.46s)]
*  Because Israel is playing a huge role and they've already shown how much damage they [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=29.88s)]
*  can do to Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=33.48s)]
*  Next round, the talks between the U.S. and Iran are tomorrow in Rome. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=35.339999999999996s)]
*  As President Trump says, he is in no rush to attack the country. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=38.72s)]
*  He wants to first see if they can make some goals when it comes to peace talks. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=42.76s)]
*  So here are the stakes. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=45.84s)]
*  What can they say? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=46.84s)]
*  They share their interests. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=47.84s)]
*  Both want to avoid war, I guess. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=48.84s)]
*  No regime change. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=50.94s)]
*  We don't want to change regimes. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=51.94s)]
*  They're not looking to overthrow the Ayatollah unless the people rise up and do that. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=53.4s)]
*  Possible economic cooperation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=57.84s)]
*  I don't see that happening, but who knows? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=59.04s)]
*  Preference for diplomacy. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=60.96s)]
*  On the other side of cooperation is additional sanctions and going after third-party sanctions [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=62.16s)]
*  like China, who buys 90 percent of Iran's oil. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=66.8s)]
*  These are some of the nuclear sites. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=69.88s)]
*  This is the one experts say is where they really got to focus on and it might be the [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=71.64s)]
*  hardest of hard targets. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=75.08s)]
*  How close is Iran to getting a nuclear weapon? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=76.72s)]
*  They need seven days to get one. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=79.32s)]
*  Look what they can get in a month. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=81.18s)]
*  Look at two months, three months, four months. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=82.6s)]
*  There is the utter definition of urgency right now to act. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=84.64s)]
*  And something's got to come out of this. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=88.1s)]
*  Is there an urgency on Iranian side? [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=89.74s)]
*  Here to discuss this is retired four-star general, Fox News senior strategic analyst, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=91.97999999999999s)]
*  chairman for the Institute of Study Award, General Jack Keene. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=96.38s)]
*  General, you didn't like the tone of the first round of talks in Oman between the U.S. and [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=99.46s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=105.46s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=106.46s)]
*  Well, because the president of the United States is unequivocal in what he's saying. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=107.46s)]
*  Iran will not have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=113.02s)]
*  And he's issued them an ultimatum. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=115.25999999999999s)]
*  And that ultimatum is pretty simple. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=117.62s)]
*  Voluntarily dismantle your nuclear enterprise completely. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=119.14s)]
*  And that means give up the enriched uranium, destroy the facilities that make the advanced [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=125.06s)]
*  centrifuges that enable that enriched uranium, destroy the ballistic missiles that would [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=130.62s)]
*  deliver the weapon systems, open Iran to anywhere, anytime inspections, and do it all by a date [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=136.38s)]
*  certain. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=144.9s)]
*  So, what we should be discussing with the Iranians is not how much enriched uranium [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=145.98000000000002s)]
*  they're going to have, because you cannot permit Iran to have any enriched uranium whatsoever, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  or the capability with advanced centrifuges to make enriched uranium. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=158.86s)]
*  Why is that? [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  Because in the 10 years since the Obama deal was cut, which permitted 3.7 percent enriched [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=165.3s)]
*  uranium. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=170.96s)]
*  I don't want to get into those kind of details, but it's important, because the Iranians [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=171.96s)]
*  today in a matter of weeks, because they have advanced centrifuges, can take that minimum [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=176.32000000000002s)]
*  amount of enriched uranium and build it to weapons great. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  So that's the issue here. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=187.32s)]
*  And while the United States wants peace and stability in the region, we've got to recognize [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=189.08s)]
*  Israel's position here. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=193.52s)]
*  They look at Iran having a nuclear weapon as an existential threat to their country. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=195.72s)]
*  And that's the reality of it, and we've got to be able to support them also. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=201.68s)]
*  If Iran got a nuclear weapon, Brian, and this is why the president is adamant about this, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=205.6s)]
*  what will happen in the region? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=210.04000000000002s)]
*  There will be a nuclear arms race in the region. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=211.8s)]
*  Saudi Arabia, the UAE, other countries will all get nuclear weapons. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=214.76000000000002s)]
*  And the danger of that is, given the volatility of the Middle East, we could see for the first [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  time in history an exchange of nuclear weapons. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=225.96s)]
*  Because of that volatility and that destability. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=231.76s)]
*  So the stakes are very high here. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=234.04s)]
*  I know, and it's got to be zero. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=236.35999999999999s)]
*  And I hope that Steve Woodcuff understands that. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  I know Marco Rubio understands that. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=240.16s)]
*  And we know that the Russians, we have the Iranian for the second week in a row, go meet [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=242.23999999999998s)]
*  with Russian delegation, including Lavrov, who says, I'll help you do this. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=245.79999999999998s)]
*  Real quick, on the plan that was in the New York Times a couple of days ago, the president [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=251.32s)]
*  said, well, he wasn't for it, he didn't deny that the plan was accurate. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=255.04s)]
*  From what you know of the war plan to take out their nuclear weapons, we have to play [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=259.52000000000004s)]
*  a role. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=263.6s)]
*  The Israelis don't have the right bombs yet to do it. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=264.6s)]
*  Do you think the president didn't like the plan or he doesn't like the idea of the attack? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=268.52000000000004s)]
*  Well, I don't know those details and I don't ask for those details because that's classified. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=275.52000000000004s)]
*  But here's what I do know. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=280.08000000000004s)]
*  The Israelis, if they had to, would do this alone. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=282.88s)]
*  They don't want to do that because they want to be supported by the United States. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=285.12s)]
*  I think Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Trump are really on the same page in dealing [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=289.44s)]
*  with Iran. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=293.32s)]
*  The president wants to see if Iran will voluntarily do this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=294.44s)]
*  If not, he would likely support with U.S. capability an Israeli-led attack and give [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=297.56s)]
*  Israel the bombers that are necessary to help destroy these targets. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=305.08s)]
*  Yes, so that would likely be a joint operation. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=310.03999999999996s)]
*  So let's talk about Ukraine and the peace talks that seem to be going nowhere. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=313.38s)]
*  Here's Secretary of State Marco Rubio. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=318.2s)]
*  Listen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=319.76s)]
*  The United States has been helping Ukraine over the last three years and we want it to [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=320.76s)]
*  end. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=325.8s)]
*  But it's not our war. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=326.8s)]
*  I want everyone to understand that. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=327.8s)]
*  And the reason why I make that point is the president has spent 87 days at the highest [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=328.8s)]
*  level of his government repeatedly taking efforts to bring this war to an end. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=332.88s)]
*  We are now reaching a point where we need to decide and determine whether this is even [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=337.79999999999995s)]
*  possible or not, which is why we're engaging both sides. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  So we need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=346.04s)]
*  or not this is doable over the next few weeks. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=349.36s)]
*  If it is, we're in. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=353.16s)]
*  If it's not, then we'll have to, we have other priorities to focus on. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=354.16s)]
*  Right, and Ukraine, and by the way, the rare earth deal is going to be formalized this [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=358.52s)]
*  week with the U.S. and Ukraine. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=362.16s)]
*  What is Rubio doing there? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=364.8s)]
*  What's his tactic? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=366.08s)]
*  He's talking to Russia. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=368.76s)]
*  And the reality is what we're seeing here, the president wants peace. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=371.04s)]
*  President Zelensky of Ukraine wants peace. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=375.56s)]
*  The Ukrainian people want peace. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=377.96000000000004s)]
*  There's one player here who doesn't want it, and that's Putin. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=379.32s)]
*  And he's been stiffen us for weeks. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=383.64000000000004s)]
*  The secretary knows that, Marco Rubio, Mike Walz, the national security adviser knows [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=385.96000000000004s)]
*  it, the negotiators know it, and the president of the United States know it. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=390.8s)]
*  And this is the Russian playbook. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=394.6s)]
*  Delay, delay, delay, stall, get concessions. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=396.32000000000005s)]
*  They want Ukraine to be in a more vulnerable position. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=399.8s)]
*  Putin has not given up his aspirations to topple a government in Ukraine and put a stooge [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZJvMY1af4sM&t=403.72s)]
