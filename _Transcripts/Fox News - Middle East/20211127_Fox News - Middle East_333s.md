**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 27, 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4)
*  Just three months ago, our next guest was one of thousands of Afghan allies desperately [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=0.0s)]
*  trying to get out of Afghanistan and secure his family's escape as Kabul fell to the Taliban. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=7.08s)]
*  Now thanks to the dedication of the troops he served alongside, Johnny, a former combat [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=13.56s)]
*  interpreter, just celebrated his first Thanksgiving in America where his three young daughters [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=18.56s)]
*  are able to receive what most Afghan girls now only dream of in education. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=24.36s)]
*  That's right and Johnny joins us now. Johnny, welcome to Fox and Friends. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=29.3s)]
*  This story just touched my heart so much, not just that you made it to America, but [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=33.660000000000004s)]
*  especially the part about your kids. I was telling Will and Pete how they wake you up [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=38.760000000000005s)]
*  there on the weekends because they're so excited about school, they still want to go to school. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  What does that mean to you to know that your girls in particular, your daughters, can go [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=47.3s)]
*  to school freely with no problems? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=52.34s)]
*  Thank you so much. Since we've been here, also my daughters, they're excited every day. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=56.74s)]
*  Early in the morning, they get up and they go to school. So they pretty much like school [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=67.74000000000001s)]
*  and they're happy, excited, back at school. They have a lot of friends over there. Also, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  every day there make me feel good, like early in the morning and wake up and keep saying [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=83.74s)]
*  like, we want to go to school, we have a friend back school, we want to first learn the language [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=90.74s)]
*  and second, we will continue our own education. So this is good for me also, for my wife. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=96.74s)]
*  Johnny, we hear you talking about education. I've heard you talk about security, that you're [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=106.74s)]
*  thankful for that sense of safety that your family now has. This is your first Thanksgiving [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=110.74s)]
*  in America. What is it you give thanks for? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=115.74s)]
*  Absolutely. Since we've been here, everything's good, everything's okay. We are feeling safe. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=120.74s)]
*  Me, my wife, and three of my children, we are safe in this safe country. So there is no worry. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=129.74s)]
*  So everything's good. Also, I'm grateful for this opportunity we have right now in this country. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=138.74s)]
*  My girls can go to school. They're able to learn education. So unfortunately, back in Afghanistan, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=147.74s)]
*  the girls and the women, they cannot go to school, they cannot get to learn education, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=155.74s)]
*  they cannot work outside. So I am happy, I'm so excited for this opportunity I have over here. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=160.74s)]
*  My daughters, they're able to go to school, learn education. Also, anything they want to become [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=169.74s)]
*  in the future, they can select and choose their destiny. Also, this is making me more feel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=176.74s)]
*  confident about their future. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=185.74s)]
*  Well, Johnny, I want to thank you for your service. You were a combat interpreter with the 82nd Airborne, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=189.74s)]
*  2009-2010, in southern Afghanistan. And reading here, 60% of the unit you were with came home with [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=194.74s)]
*  Purple Hearts. And so you saw heavy, heavy fighting. That makes you precisely the kind of guy that we [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=201.74s)]
*  wanted to get here, to come to America. How many, do you still know of other interpreters like you that [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=209.74s)]
*  are stuck there that wanted to come but couldn't make it? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=215.74s)]
*  Yeah, that was a tough time when I was selected with the Bravo Company, 2nd Battalion, 258. First, I [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=220.74s)]
*  selected in Helmand Province. After that, we moved to Kandahar Province, Argandab River Valley. That was [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=232.74s)]
*  extremely dangerous for me, for the troops. Unfortunately, we lost a lot of troops, a lot of troops wounded. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=240.74s)]
*  So that year, that was extremely hard and tough time for the soldier, also for me. I'm proud of myself. I was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=252.74s)]
*  part of those Bravo Company. They did a great job. But in Afghanistan, I'm sorry for the families we lost. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=262.74s)]
*  Also, the wounded guys, I pray for all those get well. So thank you so much. We understand and we realize [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=272.74s)]
*  that U.S. soldiers, extremely they did a great job for my country, for my people. We never forgot their dedication [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=283.74s)]
*  to my country. They were trying to bring peace, stability, security, education for the people. So unfortunately, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=292.74s)]
*  the Taliban, they came back and took over everything, shut down. Now kind of people, they live in the risk, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=301.74s)]
*  especially I left my family behind. So I'm trying to get my family from Afghanistan to bring it to the U.S. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=310.74s)]
*  Well, John, on this Thanksgiving, while you're grateful to be in this country, as Pete pointed out, we're grateful to you [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=322.74s)]
*  and your service. Thank you so much. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=326.74s)]
*  Johnnie, thank you. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=328.74s)]
*  Thank you, Johnnie. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DDHVupdt7c4&t=330.74s)]
