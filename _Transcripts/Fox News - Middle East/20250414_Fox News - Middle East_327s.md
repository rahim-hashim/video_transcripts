# Military action 'on the table' against Iran, ex-envoy warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs)
*  He gave us an update on Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, we're going to be doing it very shortly. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=2.96s)]
*  Iran also, it was another way. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=4.84s)]
*  I met with a different group of people in Iran, and we'll be making a decision on Iran [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=7.12s)]
*  very quickly. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=11.92s)]
*  Ellie Kohanam is a former State Department Deputy Special Envoy who came to the U.S. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=12.92s)]
*  as an Iranian refugee, and she joins us now. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=18.2s)]
*  Ellie, I think, good morning to you. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=21.8s)]
*  I think this is a good first start, right? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=24.68s)]
*  It was a good first start, Lawrence. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=29.4s)]
*  We heard a readout from both sides, from the United States and the Iranian side, that were [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=31.72s)]
*  very positive words. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=38.28s)]
*  And we know that there is a follow-up meeting scheduled for seven days later this coming [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=40.16s)]
*  Saturday. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=45.44s)]
*  A location seems to be determined to be in Europe and making it easier on our special [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=46.44s)]
*  envoy, Steve Wichoff. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=53.16s)]
*  And so we've heard, you know, again, positive words come out of the meeting. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=55.76s)]
*  But let's be real that the president is very sanguine on the Iranian threat. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=59.36s)]
*  In the past, he's called this regime a fanatical and radical regime. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=64.92s)]
*  He's very, our president is very clear on the nature of this regime. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=69.04s)]
*  And at the same time that these talks are taking place, we know that the United States [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=73.28s)]
*  has brought in a tremendous amount of military assets into the region. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=77.28s)]
*  And this is also at the same time where we've seen three weeks of an aerial assault on Iran-backed [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=81.8s)]
*  Houthis in Yemen. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  So I think the message to the Iranians is loud and clear. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=89.08s)]
*  We are giving you the path to diplomacy. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=92.2s)]
*  But beware that the military option is very credibly on the table. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=95.08s)]
*  Ellie, you kind of segue perfectly into what the Secretary of Defense, Pete Hex said. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=100.36s)]
*  He said the president is dead serious about Iran's nuclear threat. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=105.52s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=109.56s)]
*  President Trump is dead serious on this issue. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=110.56s)]
*  He's dead serious that Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=113.72s)]
*  He's dead serious that he wants it done at the negotiating table. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=117.36s)]
*  He wants it done peacefully. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=120.2s)]
*  And that's why he's going straight to these talks. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=121.6s)]
*  If we can't figure this out at the negotiating table, then there are other options to include [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=123.6s)]
*  my department to ensure that Iran never has a nuclear bomb. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=127.72s)]
*  So Ellie, take me into the president's thinking here. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=132.52s)]
*  I mean, you were in the first administration. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=135.56s)]
*  Some have even said that you're on the short list to be the next UN ambassador. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=137.88s)]
*  What is the president thinking right here? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=143.88s)]
*  Does he want to resolve this peacefully with them or is he frankly just prepared for what [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=145.5s)]
*  Iran wants to do, which is delay, delay, delay? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=152.18s)]
*  And he's not going to let that happen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=156.22s)]
*  Well the president has been incredibly transparent with the American people. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=160.06s)]
*  And I think that should be really reassuring in contrast to what we dealt with under Barack [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=164.42000000000002s)]
*  Obama. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=169.14s)]
*  The president at the end of March told the American people on this network, I believe, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=170.22s)]
*  that he had sent a letter to the Iranians with a two month deadline. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=175.01999999999998s)]
*  And then a week before these talks took place, the president told the American people that [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=178.89999999999998s)]
*  there would be direct talks between the United States and the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=183.1s)]
*  So the president again has been very open and very transparent and told us every step [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=188.17999999999998s)]
*  of the way what's taking place. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=192.45999999999998s)]
*  He's also clearly delineated deadline. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=194.62s)]
*  So we know that the president as the author of the Art of the Deal, he's not allowing [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=197.94s)]
*  the Iranians to drag this out indefinitely. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=203.4s)]
*  And so all of these factors are in place. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=207.76000000000002s)]
*  Again, the credible military threat is there. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  And so I think that a lot of Iran observers are nervous right now. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=213.06s)]
*  They need to have a little bit of trust in the president and this administration that [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=217.38s)]
*  they know exactly what they're dealing with on the other side. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=222.44s)]
*  And again, they are giving the Iranians a pathway to diplomacy. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=225.92000000000002s)]
*  They're allowing them to really understand and take in the situation that the Iranian [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=229.56s)]
*  regime is finding itself in, which is that they've allowed their nuclear program to get [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=234.0s)]
*  so dangerous that the United States and the international community has to hold them accountable [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=239.16s)]
*  for where they have brought themselves to. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  You know, Ellie, I got about 30 seconds left. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=249.28s)]
*  But I guess the final question would be when it comes to deadlines, I know the president [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=252.48000000000002s)]
*  is not saying, but I know people within the community and know his thinking, know that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=256.56s)]
*  deadline. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=260.6s)]
*  What type of timetable are we dealing with? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=261.6s)]
*  When do they need to completely disarm before there's some sort of action? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=263.76s)]
*  Well I think that the United States is going to demand some immediate steps from the Iranians. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=271.0s)]
*  And what we're talking about right now and what you heard the Secretary of Defense talk [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=278.1s)]
*  about yesterday was dismantlement. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=281.46s)]
*  So dismantlement will certainly, you know, again, there have to be some steps that the [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=284.0s)]
*  Iranians take right away. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=287.28s)]
*  Dismantlement preferably would be under U.S. auspices. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=289.32s)]
*  And the timeline, the two-month timeline that the president has set works very nicely with [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=293.4s)]
*  the snapback sanctions that are coming up at the United Nations. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=298.88s)]
*  And so, you know, there definitely seems to be a clear timeline of what the president [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=302.58s)]
*  is trying to take these talks towards. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=306.67999999999995s)]
*  Ellie, as always, we appreciate it. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=309.24s)]
*  We look forward to seeing what's next for you as well. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=311.2s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=313.54s)]
*  Thank you, Lawrence. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=315.12s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=316.12s)]
*  You got it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xbegcay8Jxs&t=317.12s)]
