# White House claims Biden classified document revelation has been transparent
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4)
*  Good afternoon, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=0.0s)]
*  Happy Friday and I got the date right today. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3.7800000000000002s)]
*  The day right today. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=6.76s)]
*  Oh, well, it's gonna be a little crazy in here. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=9.76s)]
*  Okay. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=16.2s)]
*  As this week comes to a close, I want to take a moment to highlight the incredible progress [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=17.52s)]
*  the president has made for the American people in recent days, from expanding affordable [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=22.6s)]
*  health care to lowering costs and tackling inflation to bringing manufacturing and jobs [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=26.76s)]
*  back to our shores. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=32.36s)]
*  President Biden started the week at the North American Leaders Summit in Mexico City, where [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=34.56s)]
*  he spoke for for two hour close cooperation with Mexico and Canada to address shared challenges [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=39.24s)]
*  that impact the American people. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=46.6s)]
*  Challenges like combating climate change, COVID-19 pandemic and transnational criminal [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=49.56s)]
*  organizations that are trafficking and smuggling people as well as illicit drugs like fentanyl. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=55.559999999999995s)]
*  The president spoke to our work to take thousands of smugglers off the streets, catch record [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=62.12s)]
*  levels of fentanyl before it even reaches our border, strengthen border security and [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=67.44s)]
*  increase resources for border communities all over the all over the opposition of Republican [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=72.6s)]
*  governors and Republican members of Congress, I might add. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=79.36s)]
*  We've also continued taking action to lower health care costs for American families made [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=83.64s)]
*  possible by President Biden and congressional Democrats enactment of the Inflation Reduction [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=88.16s)]
*  Act. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=93.68s)]
*  On Wednesday, HHS announced its historic plans for Medicare to directly negotiate negotiate [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=94.68s)]
*  lower prescription drug costs. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=101.2s)]
*  In addition, starting this month, seniors on Medicare are seeing their insulin costs [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=103.24000000000001s)]
*  capped at $35 for a month's supply. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=108.0s)]
*  They are also now able to get recommended vaccines for free. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=111.48s)]
*  All of this thanks to, again, the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=116.52000000000001s)]
*  HHS also announced record breaking enrollment number of health care coverage on the Affordable [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=120.48s)]
*  Health Care Act marketplace. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  Nearly 16 million people have signed up for this open enrollment period for health care [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=127.84s)]
*  coverage, a 13% increase from last year. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  It includes over 3 million people who are brand new to the marketplace and were not [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=137.96s)]
*  even done with the open enrollment yet. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=143.68s)]
*  Because of the cost savings measure in the Inflation Reduction Act that President Biden [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=147.0s)]
*  signed into law, millions of Americans are continuing to save $800 per year on health [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  insurance on average. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=157.52s)]
*  And four out of the five health care dot gov enrollees can find coverage for $10 or less [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  a month. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=166.5s)]
*  All of this adds up to real impact and meaningful progress to expand affordable quality health [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=168.28s)]
*  care coverage for American families. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=174.78s)]
*  And that matters. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=176.98s)]
*  That matters to the American people. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=177.98s)]
*  We also had exciting news on the economic front as well. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=179.74s)]
*  On Wednesday, as you all saw, the largest solar investment in U.S. history, a direct [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=182.62s)]
*  result of the President's economic plan and the Inflation Reduction Act again. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=187.94s)]
*  This $2.5 billion investment in Georgia will create 2,500 jobs. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=195.10000000000002s)]
*  And yesterday we learned that for the six month in a row, inflation has indeed come [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=199.82000000000002s)]
*  down. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  Annual inflation has fallen to lowest level since October of 2021. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  And gas prices are down by more than $1.70 from their peak, thanks in part to the President's [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=210.58s)]
*  actions to increase oil supply, which were also historic actions that this president [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=217.12s)]
*  took. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=222.34s)]
*  This is further proof the President's economic plan is working. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=223.38s)]
*  Even though inflation is high in most major economies, it's coming down in America and [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=226.5s)]
*  giving families more breathing room. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=232.38s)]
*  You hear the President say that all the time, how he wants to make sure that he's giving [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=234.94s)]
*  American families a little bit more of a breathing room. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=239.06s)]
*  At the same time, the President is building an economy from the bottom up and middle out [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=242.22s)]
*  with the lowest unemployment rate in 50 years, nearly 11 million jobs created and historic [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=246.58s)]
*  manufacturing investment, like I just mentioned, totaling nearly $300 billion in major investments [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=251.58s)]
*  across the country. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=257.64s)]
*  And as we end this week, on Friday the 13th, as somebody marked, today President Biden [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=259.62s)]
*  welcomed Prime Minister Kishida of Japan to the White House. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=266.58s)]
*  We will have a joint statement out for all of you shortly, laying out their conversation [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=270.22s)]
*  and their discussion this afternoon. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=275.34000000000003s)]
*  But I can tell you that the two leaders are discussing the unprecedented actions we have [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=278.42s)]
*  taken together to better equip us for the 21st century challenges, as well as working [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=282.14s)]
*  to deepen our cooperation on everything from economics to technology to fighting the climate [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=287.74s)]
*  crisis, advancing peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and around the world. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=293.7s)]
*  Today's visit is a testament to President Biden's investment in our alliances and partnerships [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=299.96s)]
*  since day one, since he walked into the administration. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=305.18s)]
*  And a historic week is leading into a historic weekend. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=309.18s)]
*  I am so happy and glad to be joined by my colleague and former mayor of Atlanta, senior [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=312.38s)]
*  advisor for public engagement, Keisha Lance Bottoms, to talk about the President's trip [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=318.26s)]
*  this coming Sunday to the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church to remember and honor the legacy [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=323.14s)]
*  of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. this Sunday, as I just said. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=329.26s)]
*  I know many of you had some interest here, so we wanted to make sure that she was here [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=333.90000000000003s)]
*  to answer any questions and to lay out why this day is going to be so important. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=337.02000000000004s)]
*  I do want to say on a personal note, as black women, we have broken barriers. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=341.74s)]
*  This church and the day honoring King are near and dear to both of our hearts. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=346.34000000000003s)]
*  I know on a personal level, we are both looking forward to joining the President on this trip [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=351.42s)]
*  and being in what has been the epicenter of the movement from civil rights in this country [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=356.62s)]
*  for decades. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=363.98s)]
*  With that, Mayor Bottoms. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=365.34000000000003s)]
*  The floor is yours. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=368.34000000000003s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=371.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, good afternoon, everyone. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  It's kind of scary up here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=375.58000000000004s)]
*  As Kareen mentioned, I am looking forward to joining the President as he travels to Atlanta [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=379.34000000000003s)]
*  this weekend. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=385.5s)]
*  As many of you all know, in Dr. King's I Have a Dream speech, he expressed many ideals that [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=386.5s)]
*  he would not live to witness. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=392.82s)]
*  But I stand here and many of you sit out there as beneficiaries of that dream, his sacrifice [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  and service. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=404.02s)]
*  So I am eternally grateful for that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=405.02s)]
*  As Kareen mentioned, the President is traveling to Atlanta. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=408.38s)]
*  This is at the invitation of Reverend Warnock. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=413.42s)]
*  The President will deliver a sermon at Ebenezer Church, which of course was Dr. King's church. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=415.94s)]
*  Also Congressman John Lewis's church. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=423.26000000000005s)]
*  The President spoke with Senator Warnock last night. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=426.26000000000005s)]
*  Senator Warnock has been the pastor since 2005 at Ebenezer. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=429.62s)]
*  They had a wonderful conversation about the significance of this historic event, including [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=434.18s)]
*  the fact that the President is the first sitting President to speak at a Sunday service at [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=440.7s)]
*  Ebenezer in its history. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=447.90000000000003s)]
*  This would have been Dr. King's 94th birthday. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=450.90000000000003s)]
*  As we know, this is an inflection point in history, and the President will deliver remarks [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=454.90000000000003s)]
*  reflecting on Dr. King's life and legacy and the way that we can go forward together. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=460.14s)]
*  During his trip to Atlanta on Sunday, he will join Reverend Al Sharpton on Monday at the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=468.06s)]
*  National Action Network, which Monday of course is the day, the official celebration day of [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=473.46s)]
*  the King holiday. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=479.38s)]
*  The President will deliver the keynote speech there. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=480.82s)]
*  And then finally, before I take any questions, this is an important day as a member of Delta [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=484.94s)]
*  Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=491.5s)]
*  This is our Founders Day, our 110th Founders Day. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=494.98s)]
*  The President did a lovely video for the women of Delta. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=498.98s)]
*  Also our Secretary of HUD, Marsha Fudge, was also a former National President of Delta. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=503.98s)]
*  So the President and the Vice President are very grateful for all of the support of the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=511.98s)]
*  women of Delta and the Divine Nine, and happy Founders Day. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=516.5s)]
*  All right, we'll take a couple questions. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=520.7s)]
*  Can I ask you if, in your role in community outreach, whether the issue of the documents [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=524.7s)]
*  is a particular setback for the President at a moment when other things seem to be going [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=531.22s)]
*  pretty well, inflation's coming down, employment is solid, are you finding that you're getting [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=536.06s)]
*  a lot of response from the public on that, and how do you play that issue? [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=540.46s)]
*  In my role as Senior Advisor for Public Engagement, we've not gotten any information on that in [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=547.6199999999999s)]
*  terms of from the public. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=553.0999999999999s)]
*  We've not received any questions. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=554.66s)]
*  And do you anticipate that that will have any bearing, or is causing the President to [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=555.66s)]
*  think at all about, as he's making his decision about whether to run again, will this series [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=561.18s)]
*  of discoveries have any bearing on his thinking and his thought process as he decides whether [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=568.66s)]
*  to run? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=575.66s)]
*  I'll refer those questions to the President. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=577.26s)]
*  He can speak for himself on that. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=578.26s)]
*  While the President's in Atlanta, what do you expect his message to be on voting rights [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=580.26s)]
*  in particular? [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=585.26s)]
*  And given that the situation in the Senate remains virtually unchanged when he spoke [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=586.26s)]
*  about this issue in Atlanta last year, is he considering any additional executive action [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=589.8199999999999s)]
*  on this issue? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=594.98s)]
*  Well, the President has been very clear that we need Congress to act. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=595.98s)]
*  He's asked for Congress to codify the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and also the additional [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=600.5400000000001s)]
*  Voting Rights Act that's pending before Congress, that's the Freedom to Vote Act. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=607.22s)]
*  So the President has been very clear that voting, the right to vote, the access to vote [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=612.02s)]
*  is a core component of our democracy, and he's going to continue to push for that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=618.46s)]
*  Including on Sunday at the church? [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=624.34s)]
*  The President will speak on a number of issues at the church, including how important it [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=627.42s)]
*  is that we have access to our democracy and you can't come to Atlanta and not acknowledge [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=633.1s)]
*  the role that the Civil Rights Movement and Dr. King played and where we are in the history [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=638.38s)]
*  of our country, but we still have to push forward. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=643.74s)]
*  We still have more work to do. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=646.8s)]
*  And just one other thing, do you expect him to have any engagement with the King family [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=648.58s)]
*  while he's down there? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=652.38s)]
*  We do expect that. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=653.8199999999999s)]
*  I know on previous Sundays, previous King Day services and many Sundays prior to the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=655.4200000000001s)]
*  pandemic, Dr. King's sister in particular is often at the service. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=662.14s)]
*  I don't know if she will be there this Sunday. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=666.98s)]
*  And we also expect other members of the King family to be there as well. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=669.7800000000001s)]
*  In regards to the voting rights, last time, around this time when President Biden went [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=673.9s)]
*  to Atlanta, some of the civil rights groups and voting rights groups skipped the speech [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=682.5s)]
*  out of concern that the White House wasn't doing enough to push this issue. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=689.7s)]
*  Aside from wanting Congress to do more, what is the message to those who feel the White [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=694.5s)]
*  House is not doing enough? [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=703.14s)]
*  Well, as I've been in this role, a senior advisor to the President since June of last [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=705.14s)]
*  year, we have engaged with civil rights leaders. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=711.06s)]
*  He's had them at the White House in a roundtable. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=713.74s)]
*  I'm in constant contact with them. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=716.98s)]
*  And I think that it's very clear that the President is doing everything that he can [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=719.14s)]
*  in his executive power to lean in on voting rights. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=723.14s)]
*  But we need Congress to do more. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=726.86s)]
*  This is important. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=728.6999999999999s)]
*  If you've come through the East Wing, you've seen the pictures of Dr. King meeting with [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=729.9s)]
*  Lyndon Johnson, meeting with other civil rights leaders, hashing out voting rights in the [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=734.9399999999999s)]
*  White House. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=739.86s)]
*  And so the fact that we are still here talking about this in 2023, I think really speaks [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=740.7800000000001s)]
*  to the fact that we need action. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=746.7800000000001s)]
*  We need that action from Congress. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=749.0200000000001s)]
*  The President has done and will continue to do all that he can do in his executive powers. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=751.1800000000001s)]
*  But there's only so much that he can do. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=757.34s)]
*  We need Congress to act. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=759.82s)]
*  Is the feeling then that he has exhausted what he can do, his powers from the White [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=761.4200000000001s)]
*  House, his executive powers? [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=768.3800000000001s)]
*  Well, if there is more that he can do, we welcome those suggestions. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=769.74s)]
*  But as I stand here today, it's my understanding that we have done all that we can do from [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=774.86s)]
*  the executive branch. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=779.74s)]
*  Now we need Congress to act. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=781.1800000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much, Mary Lynn, for being here. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=783.1800000000001s)]
*  We really appreciate it. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=787.1800000000001s)]
*  When you look at the economy, you saw the unemployment rate come down last month, and [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=789.1800000000001s)]
*  yet it went up for black women, for Latinos. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=795.1800000000001s)]
*  What is your reaction? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=797.1800000000001s)]
*  What is your focus to this administration on trying to make sure that the recovery is [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=799.42s)]
*  equal, is helping African American women? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=803.42s)]
*  Well, equity is at the center of what we do from this administration. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=805.42s)]
*  And so that's extremely important. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=809.42s)]
*  You know, it's been said that when America catches a cold, then black America catches [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=811.42s)]
*  the flu. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=817.42s)]
*  Well, that's also in relation to the economy. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=819.42s)]
*  We often know that communities of color in those communities that often face additional [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=821.42s)]
*  challenges have additional challenges with the economy. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=827.66s)]
*  The great news is that the economy is doing much better under this administration. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=829.66s)]
*  Also, the president is going to continue to lean in to make sure that we have access to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=837.66s)]
*  resources that are specific to communities of color, that are specific to women, to give [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=843.66s)]
*  us those opportunities to be successful in this economy. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=849.66s)]
*  I know that he will generally speak about where we are just in terms of helping those [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=853.9s)]
*  who are in need in our communities. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=863.9s)]
*  I don't know if he will specifically address the economy, but as you all know, during Dr. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=865.9s)]
*  King's last major campaign before his assassination, it was called the Poor People's Campaign. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=871.9s)]
*  And what we know is that from this administration, many of the focus areas have been aligned with [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=877.9s)]
*  what Dr. King was focused on at the time of his assassination. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=882.14s)]
*  That's making sure that we are creating this beloved community, free from hate, free from [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=888.14s)]
*  poverty, giving people access to resources so that they can have what they need to compete [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=894.14s)]
*  and succeed. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=898.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=900.14s)]
*  Thinking back to the 2020 campaign, part of the president's strategy at the time was going [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=902.14s)]
*  to visit these churches to engage some of the voters that he needed to turn out for [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=908.38s)]
*  him. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=912.38s)]
*  In South Carolina, there was the 16th Street bombing anniversary that he spoke at in Alabama [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=914.38s)]
*  and also in Selma for Bloody Sunday. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=918.38s)]
*  Is this speech at Ebenezer the start of a similar outreach campaign heading into 2024? [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=920.38s)]
*  I don't know that it's the start of it, but it could be a great start of it. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=926.38s)]
*  I know that the president is very interested in connecting with people hearing directly [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=930.38s)]
*  from people. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=936.62s)]
*  It's the best way that any elected official truly hears and understands the needs of people. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=938.62s)]
*  There's no better place than to do that than at Ebenezer. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=944.62s)]
*  Reverend Warnock has not just been very vocal about the challenges and the issues that are [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=948.62s)]
*  facing people as a candidate, but also as a pastor. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=954.62s)]
*  Ebenezer is a cornerstone in the Atlanta community. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=958.62s)]
*  I'm sure the president will get an earful on what our needs and our desires are for [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=962.86s)]
*  our country when he's there. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=968.86s)]
*  Can you provide any insight into the writing process for this speech? [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=970.86s)]
*  I know that Austin has spent a lot of time paying attention to speeches like this. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=972.86s)]
*  How long has the president been working on it for? [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=976.86s)]
*  We've been working on it for a couple of weeks as a team and of course with the president's [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=978.86s)]
*  input. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=984.86s)]
*  Any major speech that the president is giving, he gives his input and the team takes it from [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=987.1s)]
*  there and then he takes his pen and he says what he wants to say and you'll hear that [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=993.1s)]
*  on Sunday. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=999.1s)]
*  Is it finished? [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1001.1s)]
*  No. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1003.1s)]
*  That was finished. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1005.1s)]
*  Okay. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1007.1s)]
*  Just one question. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1009.1s)]
*  Obviously Democrats had a big victory in the run-up election in Georgia. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1011.1s)]
*  He's going back to a historic black institution. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1015.34s)]
*  How do you see your home state fitting into the political landscape going forward now? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1017.34s)]
*  Georgia is pretty important. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1023.34s)]
*  I've always thought that now the rest of the country knows it. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1025.34s)]
*  We know that Georgia has played an important role with how our Senate is now comprised [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1029.34s)]
*  and I expect that that role will continue to be just as important in future election cycles. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1035.34s)]
*  And remember, I just have to say this, Georgia did go for Joe Biden. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1041.58s)]
*  All right. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1045.58s)]
*  Go ahead, Ebenezer. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1047.58s)]
*  Last question. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1049.58s)]
*  Just a couple of questions. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1051.58s)]
*  First, whether it be on Monday or on Sunday when he's at Ebenezer, is he going to be meeting [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1053.58s)]
*  with any civil rights organizations at any point during any of those visits? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1057.58s)]
*  Well, as I mentioned on Monday, he will be meeting with any civil rights organizations [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1063.58s)]
*  at any point during any of those visits? [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1067.82s)]
*  Well, as I mentioned on Monday, he will be joining Reverend Al at the National Action Network. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1069.82s)]
*  There will be many civil rights representatives there. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1073.82s)]
*  There will be many at the church who will also have an opportunity to connect with the [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1077.82s)]
*  president while he's there. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1081.82s)]
*  Nothing separately? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1083.82s)]
*  Nothing separately, but there will be some engagement while at the church. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1085.82s)]
*  And at the policy forum with Reverend Al Sharpton when he attends the NAN event, what kind of [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1089.82s)]
*  policies can you talk about that you know that they'll be talking about on that day? [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1096.06s)]
*  Or what kind of policies do you think that we can kind of expect to hear the president [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1100.06s)]
*  talk about even following that? [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1106.06s)]
*  I know that Rev has been talking about criminal justice reform quite a lot and had several [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1108.06s)]
*  other meetings. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1112.06s)]
*  Can we see the president pick back up on those same messages following this? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1114.06s)]
*  Well, the great thing is that this is not a one-time engagement. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1116.06s)]
*  Reverend Al and some of the other civil rights leaders, I believe, from eight other organizations [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1120.06s)]
*  were in the White House a few months ago, sitting down with the president, sharing their concerns. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1124.3s)]
*  We, my office, me personally, I'm constantly engaged with these civil rights leaders. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1130.3s)]
*  So we are hearing in real time what our challenges are. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1136.3s)]
*  And I think I can safely say that we have confidence in many of these leaders that we [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1140.3s)]
*  are doing what we can do and will continue to do more as we can to make sure that the needs of [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1146.3s)]
*  our communities are met. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1152.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1154.54s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1156.54s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1158.54s)]
*  How did you feel when President Biden picked Kamala Harris instead of you for all the meetings? [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1160.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1164.54s)]
*  Thanks, everybody. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1166.54s)]
*  And thank you so much, Keisha. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1168.54s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1170.54s)]
*  I have a couple things at the top that I just want to go through. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1172.54s)]
*  This is the week ahead, so all of you have this. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1178.54s)]
*  So before we take questions. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1180.78s)]
*  So later today, the president is going to travel to Wilmington, Delaware, as you all know. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1182.78s)]
*  On Sunday, as you just heard from Mayor Lance Bottoms, the president will travel to Atlanta, Georgia [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1186.78s)]
*  and deliver a sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1192.78s)]
*  And on Monday, he will return to Washington, D.C. to join Reverend Al Sharpton and the National Action Network [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1194.78s)]
*  at their Martin Luther King Jr. Day breakfast where he will deliver the keynote address. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1202.78s)]
*  On Tuesday, the president looks forward to welcoming Prime Minister Mark Woutte of the Netherlands [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1209.02s)]
*  to the White House to further deepen the historic ties between our two nations. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1215.02s)]
*  As strong NATO allies and global partners, the two leaders will reaffirm our shared efforts [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1219.02s)]
*  to strengthen transatlantic security and economic prosperity. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1225.02s)]
*  After that bilateral meeting, the president will welcome the Golden State Warriors to the White House [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1229.02s)]
*  to celebrate their 2022 NBA championship. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1235.26s)]
*  And next Friday, the president will welcome bipartisan mayors attending the U.S. Conference of Mayors Winter Meeting to the White House. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1239.26s)]
*  The president will deliver remarks celebrating the achievements of the past 18 months [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1247.26s)]
*  and focusing on the bipartisan work that needs to be done to implement these and other historic pieces of legislative victories [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1253.26s)]
*  at the local level to make a difference in people's lives across the country. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1261.5s)]
*  With that, Chris, do you want to kick us off? [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1269.5s)]
*  Sure. A question on a couple of new topics. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1271.5s)]
*  Speaker McCarthy has invited the president to deliver the State of the Union on February 7th. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1273.5s)]
*  I think this went out. Is that the date that the president plans to give the State of the Union? [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1277.5s)]
*  Does he accept that invitation? [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1281.5s)]
*  So we have received Speaker McCarthy's kind invitation and the president has accepted it [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1283.5s)]
*  and looks forward to delivering the State of the Union address on Tuesday, February 17th of 2023. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1287.74s)]
*  Oh my gosh. I'm so sorry guys. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1293.74s)]
*  On Tuesday, February 7th, 2023. But we truly appreciate the kind invitation by Speaker McCarthy. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1297.74s)]
*  On the debt limit, Republicans want to cut spending as part of a debt limit deal. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1303.74s)]
*  Is the president willing to cut any spending as part of a debt limit deal? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1308.74s)]
*  And what would he be willing to cut? [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1312.74s)]
*  You've heard us say before, we will not be doing any negotiation over the debt ceiling. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1314.98s)]
*  But broadly speaking, at the start of this new Congress, we're reaching out to all the members [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1320.98s)]
*  through the Office of Ledge Affairs, making sure that we have those connections with those new members, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1326.98s)]
*  as I just stated. But I want to say, in the past, and I've said this before and I'll say it again, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1333.98s)]
*  there's been a bipartisan cooperation when it comes to lifting the debt ceiling. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1339.22s)]
*  And that's how it should be. That's how it should continue. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1344.22s)]
*  It's not and should not be a political football. This is not political gamemanship. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1347.22s)]
*  And this should be done without conditions. And that's how we see this process moving forward. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1352.22s)]
*  You say that there will be no negotiating. You will not negotiate anything involving spending? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1358.22s)]
*  What we're saying is that this should be done without conditions. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1362.22s)]
*  In the past, we have seen both Republicans and Democrats come together to deal with this issue. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1367.46s)]
*  It is one of the basic items that Congress has to deal with. And it should be done without conditions. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1375.46s)]
*  So there is going to be no negotiation over it. This is something that must get done. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1381.46s)]
*  And does the President agree with the Treasury Secretary that the debt ceiling should be eliminated? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1388.46s)]
*  Again, I've spoken to this before. That is not, no one is talking about eliminating the debt ceiling [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1393.7s)]
*  or the debt limit. That's not what we're talking about right now. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1399.7s)]
*  Congress is going to need to raise the debt limit without conditions. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1402.7s)]
*  So that is not the discussion that we're having. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1406.7s)]
*  Very last thing. Have White House officials been interviewed by the special counsel or by the Justice Department [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1408.7s)]
*  involving the classified documents? [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1414.7s)]
*  So what I'll say from here is any questions that you may have about the review, about the process, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1416.7s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice. I would also refer you to my colleagues over at the White House Council. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1422.94s)]
*  I'm not going to get into any specifics from here. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1428.94s)]
*  Aside from the special counsel, aside from this review, I just have a question about process and classified documents [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1431.94s)]
*  and their handling. I think there's some confusion amongst the public and even in this room. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1437.94s)]
*  What is the process to make sure that classified documents aren't accidentally or intentionally taken [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1441.94s)]
*  when a president or vice president leaves office? What's the protocol or is this sort of just a self-review system? [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1448.18s)]
*  It's a good question. I would, on the process and how that works, I would certainly refer you to the White House [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1454.18s)]
*  Counsel's office. They would know that. They can walk you through that. My colleagues there. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1461.18s)]
*  And I know many of you have been in touch with my colleagues in the last 24 hours, in direct touch, [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1465.18s)]
*  in answering many of your questions. So I would refer you to them on the specific process so that they will certainly [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1473.42s)]
*  guide you in the right way. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1479.42s)]
*  But as far as you know, is it ever okay for classified documents to be mixed with personal evidence? [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1481.42s)]
*  What I can say is what the president has said before, what I have said multiple times. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1485.42s)]
*  We take this very seriously. The president takes classified information, classified documents very seriously. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1491.42s)]
*  But look, I've said this before. We have addressed this issue multiple times at length. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1497.66s)]
*  And we have been fully cooperating with the Department of Justice. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1503.66s)]
*  And now we will be doing the same with the special counsel's office. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1509.66s)]
*  Just to be prudent here and just to make sure that we are consistent, I would refer you to anything that is related to this [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1513.66s)]
*  as it relates to the review to the Department of Justice or my colleagues at the White House Counsel Office. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1521.9s)]
*  And we see it as the best way to move forward. We want to respect the process. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1527.9s)]
*  And so that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1533.9s)]
*  You're confident he followed whatever protocol was in place? [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1535.9s)]
*  Again, this is something that he takes very seriously. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1539.9s)]
*  The president, when it comes to classified documents, when it comes to classified information, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1543.9s)]
*  I'm not going to go into any specifics from here. If you have any questions, anything further that's related to the review, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1548.14s)]
*  or I will refer you to the Department of Justice or my colleagues over at the White House Counsel's Office, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1554.14s)]
*  who I know many of you who I'm staring at right now, have been in close touch. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1560.14s)]
*  A few things. Doreen, thank you. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1564.14s)]
*  Following up on the State of the Union, I believe it was the president who suggested he has spoken with Speaker McCarthy. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1566.14s)]
*  Are there any plans for them to meet in person before February? [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1572.14s)]
*  I think we actually share that with all of you. The day that Speaker McCarthy became speaker, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1576.38s)]
*  you saw a statement from the president and the first lady congratulating Kevin McCarthy becoming speaker. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1582.38s)]
*  And then the next day, I believe it was, that was on a Friday, I believe the next day, which was a Saturday, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1590.38s)]
*  the president had a direct conversation. He connected with Speaker McCarthy and congratulated him in person. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1596.38s)]
*  But no plans yet for... [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1602.38s)]
*  I don't have a scheduled meeting to share with you at this time. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1604.6200000000001s)]
*  I wanted to follow up on a few things from yesterday. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1608.6200000000001s)]
*  When was the president informed about the Attorney General's decision to appoint a special counsel? How and by whom? [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1610.6200000000001s)]
*  So, the specifics on that, here's what I can tell you. I can tell you that we were not giving a heads up. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1616.6200000000001s)]
*  I was asked that question yesterday. We did not know that the announcement was going to come yesterday, [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1622.6200000000001s)]
*  until after it happened, so I can clear the deck there and let you know. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1628.6200000000001s)]
*  Anything else specific to when the president knew or anything that's related to this, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1632.86s)]
*  I would refer you to the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1637.86s)]
*  I know many of you that I'm looking at right now has been in close touch with my colleague there. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1639.86s)]
*  And so I would continue to refer you to my colleague at the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1644.86s)]
*  One of the things that they finally confirmed for us is that Bob Bauer is indeed the president's personal attorney handling some of this. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1651.86s)]
*  Given that the Justice Department cited the personal counsel as having made this initial outreach to National Archives [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1659.1s)]
*  and has been in touch with the Justice Department, is that the person who these questions should be directed to? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1668.1s)]
*  Why the White House Counsel? [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1675.1s)]
*  I will say this again. Whatever the White House Counsel, my colleague told you in your conversation, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1677.1s)]
*  I know you guys just spoke or connected earlier today, I would ask them that question. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1683.34s)]
*  And anything related to the review, I would refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1689.34s)]
*  Regarding the extraordinary measures that the Treasury Secretary announced a little while ago in advance notice to Congress, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1693.34s)]
*  is there a policy that requires her to give advance notice of those plans? [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1702.34s)]
*  You would have to reach out to the Department of Treasury on how that process works. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1708.34s)]
*  What I can say is just so that everyone knows, folks who are watching, the debt limit is projected to be reached on Thursday, January 19. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1712.58s)]
*  At that point, Treasury will begin to take extraordinary measures to prevent default. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1720.58s)]
*  Secretary Yellen did not name a specific ex-state, if you will. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1725.58s)]
*  The day Treasury would no longer be able to pay the government's obligations, but quoting from the Secretary's letter, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1730.58s)]
*  it's unlikely that cash and extraordinary measures will be exhausted before early June. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1738.82s)]
*  But that does not mean that Congress should not wait until then to raise the debt ceiling, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1744.82s)]
*  as we have been saying over and over again. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1750.82s)]
*  The sooner Congress acts, the better, since even the prospect of not raising the debt ceiling [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1752.82s)]
*  will have damaged the full faith and the credit of our nation. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1757.82s)]
*  And again, we are going to continue to encourage Congress to act. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1761.82s)]
*  But as far as the steps and how this all works, I would refer you to the Department of Treasury. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1767.06s)]
*  Six days until the 19th. A few years ago, she did it about 10 days before. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1771.06s)]
*  I understand. I would refer you to the Department of Treasury. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1775.06s)]
*  Nothing to it being announced today amid the situation that the White House is facing. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1778.06s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Treasury. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1781.06s)]
*  And just to be very clear here, Ed, we have, I've been in here almost every day since we got back from Mexico City, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1784.06s)]
*  standing here taking your questions at length, so we're not avoiding anything here. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1790.06s)]
*  You've heard from the President at least twice, and we have put forth multiple statements [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1795.3s)]
*  from the White House Counsel's Office. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1801.3s)]
*  So that suggestion, I just disagree with. Go ahead, Kristen. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1803.3s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1806.3s)]
*  Does the White House and does the President agree to fully cooperate with the special counsel investigation? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1808.3s)]
*  We have said that we are going to continue to fully cooperate. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1814.3s)]
*  We have been. The President's lawyers and team has been fully cooperating with the Department of Justice [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1818.3s)]
*  and we're certainly, they're certainly going to do that with the special counsel. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1824.54s)]
*  And so by that reasoning, would the President agree to sit for it and on the record in person? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1827.54s)]
*  I'm just not, I'm not going to get into specifics or get ahead of what's going to happen. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1833.54s)]
*  I'm not going to get into hypotheticals because that is a hypothetical. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1837.54s)]
*  What I will say is we have addressed this multiple times at length and we are going to continue. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1840.54s)]
*  The President's team is going to continue to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1846.54s)]
*  And we respect that process and that's what we're going to do. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1850.78s)]
*  The President has said he hopes to speak about this soon. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1853.78s)]
*  When can people expect to hear from him? [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1856.78s)]
*  Don't have, again, that's a, that is, that is something that I can't, I don't have a magic wand here. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1858.78s)]
*  I don't know when that's going to happen. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1864.78s)]
*  What I can say is his team is going to fully cooperate with the Department of Justice. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1866.78s)]
*  Let's not forget, the President said during the campaign that when it comes to the Department of Justice independence, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1871.78s)]
*  he respects that and that is something that he had said was incredibly important to make sure that they had their independence. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1878.02s)]
*  That's why we say we're going to make sure that they have their independence [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1885.02s)]
*  and that's why I'm saying that we're going to refer to the Department of Justice. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1889.02s)]
*  And let me just ask you a big picture question here. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1893.02s)]
*  Does the White House broadly speaking have an obligation to share not just with the National Archives [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1896.02s)]
*  but with the American people when the existence of classified information is found in a private location? [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1901.02s)]
*  Again, there is a process in this. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1907.26s)]
*  But just a big picture, not necessarily in this instance, but is it the policy of the White House [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1910.26s)]
*  that they should share that information not just with the National Archives but with the Americans? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1915.26s)]
*  So, I'll say this, Kristen. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1919.26s)]
*  We have been transparent in the last couple of days. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1922.26s)]
*  Remember, there's an ongoing process and we have spoken when it is appropriate. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1925.26s)]
*  And we have shared, again, I've been here almost every day, not every day, but from Wednesday, yesterday and today, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1930.26s)]
*  taking your questions on this. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1936.5s)]
*  The White House Council has put out a very extensive multiple statements on this as well. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1938.5s)]
*  And you all, I know, you all have been talking, many of you here have been talking to my colleague in the White House Council. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1945.5s)]
*  So, the actions that we took were right actions that his team took [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1952.5s)]
*  in dealing with the Department of Justice and also the Archives. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1959.5s)]
*  But you guys have answered questions when the press has broken and the news... [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1963.74s)]
*  Because it's an ongoing process. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1968.74s)]
*  Because, again, it is an ongoing process. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1970.74s)]
*  There is a process here. The Department of Justice is independent. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1973.74s)]
*  We respect that process. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1976.74s)]
*  But again, I have taken questions. I can take two questions through a hundred questions. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1978.74s)]
*  I have answered your questions almost every day on this issue. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1982.74s)]
*  And again, anything else that you may have, anything that's related to the review, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1988.74s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1992.98s)]
*  One last question because I know you're going to move on here. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1994.98s)]
*  But the President campaigned on the argument that he would restore competence. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=1996.98s)]
*  We know that he's in the process of deciding whether to officially announce he's running for reelection. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2002.98s)]
*  Does this episode undercut that argument that he would restore competence? [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2006.98s)]
*  Because here we have in the headlines that he is now under investigation by Special Counsel. [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2012.98s)]
*  He's restored independence in the Department of Justice. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2017.98s)]
*  That's what we're doing here. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2019.98s)]
*  We're going to refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2022.22s)]
*  That is restoring independence as it relates to issues like this. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2024.22s)]
*  And that is important to the President. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2028.22s)]
*  And it's been consistent. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2030.22s)]
*  What I am saying about investigations has been consistent for the last two years. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2032.22s)]
*  You've heard me over and over again when it comes to a legal issue or a matter like this. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2036.22s)]
*  We have always referred to the Department of Justice. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2041.22s)]
*  So there's nothing here, different here. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2045.22s)]
*  We have said we wanted to restore the independence of the Department of Justice. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2047.22s)]
*  That is what you're seeing. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2051.4599999999996s)]
*  And again, this has been done in a transparent way when it relates to how this was dealt with [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2053.4599999999996s)]
*  with the Department of Justice and the Archives. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2061.4599999999996s)]
*  The President takes this very, very seriously. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2063.4599999999996s)]
*  Any other questions that you may have about this particular issue, about the review, [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2065.4599999999996s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2071.4599999999996s)]
*  You guys have been in touch with my colleagues at the White House Counsel Office. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2073.4599999999996s)]
*  And I would suggest that you continue to reach out. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2076.4599999999996s)]
*  Go ahead, Stephen. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2078.4599999999996s)]
*  I appreciate you on that point about the idea of disclosures when it's appropriate. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2080.7s)]
*  You describe it in the process, but it sort of feels like a strategy, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2083.7s)]
*  a communication strategy to protect the President from political damage. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2086.7s)]
*  Was it the hope and expectation here that this would have remained a private matter [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2090.7s)]
*  and not have been subject to public disclosure? [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2094.7s)]
*  Look, Stephen, that's your version of the case. [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2096.7s)]
*  I've been very clear here. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2098.7s)]
*  And I've answered that question multiple times in different versions, right, in the last couple of days. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2100.7s)]
*  Look, I want to be very clear. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2107.9399999999996s)]
*  There is a process here. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2109.9399999999996s)]
*  We are going to respect the process. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2110.9399999999996s)]
*  This is all part of the Department of Justice process. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2112.9399999999996s)]
*  And we are cooperating fully. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2116.9399999999996s)]
*  We are cooperating fully in this process. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2118.9399999999996s)]
*  And again, the President believes that the Justice Department [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2121.9399999999996s)]
*  and its independence needed to be restored. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2126.9399999999996s)]
*  That's what you have seen under this administration the last two years. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2129.9399999999996s)]
*  And I want to be consistent in what I'm saying. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2132.9399999999996s)]
*  I want to be prudent in what I'm saying. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2134.9399999999996s)]
*  When I say that we are going to defer any questions related to this to the Department of Justice [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2137.18s)]
*  and any other items that you have. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2143.18s)]
*  If you don't want to talk to the Department of Justice, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2145.18s)]
*  you're free to talk to the White House Counsel Office. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2147.18s)]
*  I know you guys have been in touch with my colleagues there. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2149.18s)]
*  We have done both. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2152.18s)]
*  But let me just ask you, because oftentimes in the careers of White House Press Secretaries, [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2153.18s)]
*  there comes a time where they are asked what they knew and when they knew it. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2157.18s)]
*  Were you or any member of your staff involved in the crafting of the strategy [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2162.18s)]
*  and this disclosure should be made in advance of CBS News breaking the story on Monday? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2166.4199999999996s)]
*  No. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2171.4199999999996s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2172.4199999999996s)]
*  Did you have a question? [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2173.4199999999996s)]
*  I think I did. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2175.4199999999996s)]
*  I was driving down the answer bit by bit. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2176.4199999999996s)]
*  A couple legal questions for you. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2177.4199999999996s)]
*  Do you have a position on how high the debt limit should be raised? [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2178.4199999999996s)]
*  I don't have a position on that. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2182.4199999999996s)]
*  What I can say more broadly... [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2184.4199999999996s)]
*  Wait, wait. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2186.4199999999996s)]
*  I mean, what I'm saying is that more broadly speaking, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2187.4199999999996s)]
*  not going to get into the specifics of that, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2190.4199999999996s)]
*  what I can say is that we believe when it comes to the debt limit [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2193.66s)]
*  it has been done in a bipartisan way over the years and decades [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2196.66s)]
*  and it should be done in a bipartisan way and it should be done without conditions. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2201.66s)]
*  That is important here. [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2205.66s)]
*  And so we're going to continue to encourage and ask Congress to take action [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2207.66s)]
*  and that's where we're going to leave it at this time. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2212.66s)]
*  We're not going to do any negotiations [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2214.66s)]
*  and it should be again done without conditions. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2216.66s)]
*  Would you make calls to Congress on all of this alleged famously [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2219.66s)]
*  or is it entirely to Congress? [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2222.8999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I've said that our Office of Ledge Affairs [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2223.8999999999996s)]
*  has been in touch with the new Congress [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2226.8999999999996s)]
*  to make sure that they know who to reach out, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2228.8999999999996s)]
*  the appropriate people to reach out on the Office of Ledge Affairs. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2230.8999999999996s)]
*  And so we're going to continue. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2233.8999999999996s)]
*  We're always having conversations with members of Congress. [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2235.8999999999996s)]
*  The President always has multiple conversations with members of Congress. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2238.8999999999996s)]
*  As you know, he has a lot of longtime friends [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2242.8999999999996s)]
*  who are over on the other side of Pennsylvania. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2245.8999999999996s)]
*  And so that is something that continues. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2249.8999999999996s)]
*  But when it comes to this, when it comes to the debt limit, [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2252.14s)]
*  it should be done without conditions. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2255.14s)]
*  It was done under the last President three times [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2257.14s)]
*  in a bipartisan way and so this should continue. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2260.14s)]
*  Very quickly on the CPI data yesterday, [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2263.14s)]
*  pretty good result there. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2266.14s)]
*  That comes on the heels of the jobs data, which was pretty strong. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2268.14s)]
*  Your officials have been kind of jazzed about that, [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2272.14s)]
*  it seems, on TV in the last 24 hours or so. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2275.14s)]
*  Is it fair to say the White House is thinking [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2278.14s)]
*  this is what a soft landing could look like [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2281.3799999999997s)]
*  or are you not getting that far? [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2283.3799999999997s)]
*  What we can say. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2286.3799999999997s)]
*  Team soft landing. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2288.3799999999997s)]
*  I'll say this, and as you said, you've heard from many of my colleagues [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2289.3799999999997s)]
*  who are economists who have been working on this issue [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2292.3799999999997s)]
*  pushing forward the President's economic plan. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2296.3799999999997s)]
*  Look, it just goes back to the President's economic plan [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2298.3799999999997s)]
*  and we see it as it's working, right? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2303.3799999999997s)]
*  The vision that the President has for this country, [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2306.3799999999997s)]
*  when he came in, he passed the American Rescue Plan, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2309.62s)]
*  you think about all the other historic pieces of legislation, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2311.62s)]
*  the bipartisan infrastructure legislation. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2314.62s)]
*  I talked multiple times at the top about the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2316.62s)]
*  Look, it matters what the vision of a President is [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2321.62s)]
*  and him acting out on it, and that's what you saw. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2325.62s)]
*  When you see inflation down for six months, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2328.62s)]
*  that matters, right? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2331.62s)]
*  That's because of the President's economic plan. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2333.62s)]
*  When you see annual inflation down 6.5% [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2335.62s)]
*  from where it was this summer, just this summer at 9.1%, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2338.8599999999997s)]
*  gas prices down by about more than $1.70 from its peak, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2343.8599999999997s)]
*  all of that matters. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2349.8599999999997s)]
*  And so that's how we're seeing this. [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2351.8599999999997s)]
*  We're seeing it as the President's economic plan is indeed working. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2353.8599999999997s)]
*  We are going to continue to put the American families [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2356.8599999999997s)]
*  and American people first and work on this issue [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2359.8599999999997s)]
*  that you hear us talk about all the time. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2362.8599999999997s)]
*  His number one economic issue is bringing down inflation. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2364.8599999999997s)]
*  That's why the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2368.1s)]
*  what I talked about when you think about health care, [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2370.1s)]
*  when you think about Medicare and negotiating those prices, [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2372.1s)]
*  when you think about what we announced in Georgia, [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2375.1s)]
*  2,500 jobs are going to be created because of the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2378.1s)]
*  All of that, all of that matters, and all of that is important [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2382.1s)]
*  in its more broadly speaking about the President's economic plan. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2386.1s)]
*  Look, we believe that we continue to be in this transition [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2390.1s)]
*  of stable and steady growth, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2393.1s)]
*  and I think that's what we believe, [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2395.3399999999997s)]
*  that's what the numbers continue to show [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2397.3399999999997s)]
*  as you talk about the jobs report that we saw recently [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2399.3399999999997s)]
*  and as we talk about the CPI data. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2402.3399999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying that we are in this transition [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2405.3399999999997s)]
*  to stable and steady growth, [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2409.3399999999997s)]
*  and we believe that the President's economic policies [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2412.3399999999997s)]
*  that he's put forward in the past two years, [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2415.3399999999997s)]
*  we see that working. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2418.3399999999997s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2420.3399999999997s)]
*  U.S. Attorney John Lush was looking into this [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2421.3399999999997s)]
*  for several weeks before. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2423.58s)]
*  He was in touch with... [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2426.58s)]
*  Looking into what exactly? [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2427.58s)]
*  The classified documents. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2428.58s)]
*  He was in touch with President Biden's counsel. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2430.58s)]
*  I wanted to know, was President Biden, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2435.58s)]
*  was the White House surprised that, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2438.58s)]
*  along with Mayor Garland, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2441.58s)]
*  that they decided that more investigation was needed [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2444.58s)]
*  and a special counsel was appointed? [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2447.58s)]
*  What I can tell you is that we were not given a heads up [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2451.58s)]
*  that Attorney General Garland was going to make his, [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2454.58s)]
*  made his announcement yesterday on the special counsel. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2458.58s)]
*  That is something that we learned, [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2460.58s)]
*  like many of you watching the news. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2462.58s)]
*  I'm not gonna get into anything further from that. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2466.58s)]
*  I can't speak to this person who you just mentioned, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2470.58s)]
*  who has been, I don't know, having conversations [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2473.58s)]
*  or making comments about this. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2476.58s)]
*  I'm just not gonna get into that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2477.58s)]
*  I'm not gonna give reactions from here. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2478.58s)]
*  What I can tell you is that, again, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2481.58s)]
*  I'm gonna refer you to the White House counsel [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2483.58s)]
*  and office to talk to my colleagues [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2485.58s)]
*  on any particular questions that you may have [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2488.58s)]
*  that's related to this process. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2490.58s)]
*  And if it's something that you wanna know specifically [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2493.58s)]
*  about the review, I refer you to the Department of Justice. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2495.58s)]
*  When President Biden did say, you know, [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2498.58s)]
*  God willing, he hoped to be able to say more soon, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2499.58s)]
*  I mean, it seemed like he was thinking [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2502.58s)]
*  that the investigation would end soon. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2504.58s)]
*  Was he surprised? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2505.58s)]
*  Again, I'm just not going to go beyond [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2506.58s)]
*  what the president said. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2508.58s)]
*  I will say this, is that we are gonna continue [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2510.58s)]
*  to fully cooperate. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2515.58s)]
*  As I've said, we have talked about this at length. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2516.58s)]
*  We've had multiple statements on this. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2519.58s)]
*  And again, we want to be prudent here. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2521.58s)]
*  I'm gonna be consistent here. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2523.58s)]
*  Any questions that you may have about this process, [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2524.58s)]
*  I would refer you to the White House counsel. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2527.58s)]
*  On another topic, I wanted to ask about [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2529.58s)]
*  the administration's appeal of the subpoena [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2532.58s)]
*  and springs mass shooting case. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2535.58s)]
*  Does it concern the administration [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2538.58s)]
*  that some gun control advocates are concerned [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2541.58s)]
*  or worried about the appeal by the DOJ [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2544.58s)]
*  and that that appeal undercuts Biden's own stance [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2548.58s)]
*  on background checks? [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2552.58s)]
*  And actually also that the NRA is essentially [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2553.58s)]
*  applauding the DOJ's move. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2556.58s)]
*  So look, when it comes to issues like this, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2558.58s)]
*  legal issues, that is something [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2561.58s)]
*  that the Department of Justice deals with. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2563.58s)]
*  Again, they are independent. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2565.58s)]
*  So I would refer you to them on their decision. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2567.58s)]
*  The president continues to be committed [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2571.58s)]
*  on making sure that we address an issue [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2573.58s)]
*  that is affecting families across the country, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2576.58s)]
*  communities across the country, which is gun violence. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2578.58s)]
*  That's why it was so critical when he signed [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2580.58s)]
*  the bipartisan piece of legislation on gun violence [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2582.58s)]
*  just a couple of months ago, this past summer. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2585.58s)]
*  And he's going to continue to call [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2587.58s)]
*  for the ban of assault weapons, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2590.58s)]
*  working with Congress to make that happen. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2592.58s)]
*  And let's not forget the first year and a half [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2594.58s)]
*  of this administration, we put forward more [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2596.58s)]
*  executive actions than any other president [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2600.58s)]
*  on dealing with this issue, on dealing with [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2602.58s)]
*  protecting our communities, protecting families, [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2604.58s)]
*  dealing with gun violence. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2607.58s)]
*  And that call that he has, especially the call [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2608.58s)]
*  to action from Congress, is going to continue [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2612.58s)]
*  and it's not going to stop. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2614.58s)]
*  I'm going to go to the back. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2616.58s)]
*  Yes. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2617.58s)]
*  I have two questions on the meeting [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2618.58s)]
*  with the prime minister. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2620.58s)]
*  Just briefly on the documents, we have seen [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2621.58s)]
*  online propaganda from adversaries seeking [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2624.58s)]
*  to take advantage from this revolution. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2627.58s)]
*  I'm sorry, can you go back a little bit? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2630.58s)]
*  Who's seeking to take advantage? [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2632.58s)]
*  We have seen online propaganda from adversaries [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2634.58s)]
*  seeking to take advantage of the revelation [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2637.58s)]
*  of the classified documents. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2639.58s)]
*  I wonder if you can share with us whether [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2641.58s)]
*  the administration is anticipating any kind of [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2643.58s)]
*  national security implications from this fallout. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2646.58s)]
*  Are you hearing any kind of intelligence [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2649.58s)]
*  and are you doing anything to deter those threats? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2651.58s)]
*  Again, I'm just not going to talk about [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2654.58s)]
*  any intelligence from here. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2656.58s)]
*  I would certainly, anything that's related to this, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2658.58s)]
*  I would refer you to the Department of Justice [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2661.58s)]
*  and also refer you to my colleagues at the [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2663.58s)]
*  White House Council. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2665.58s)]
*  I'm just not going to go into anything, [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2666.58s)]
*  especially national security affairs, [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2668.58s)]
*  and so I would refer you to them. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2672.58s)]
*  I'd probably follow up with your national security [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2674.58s)]
*  council affairs. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2676.58s)]
*  That'd be great. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2677.58s)]
*  On the meeting, I know we're waiting for a readout, [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2678.58s)]
*  but if you can tell us whether the leaders spoke [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2681.58s)]
*  about semiconductors and whether Japan confirmed [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2684.58s)]
*  that it will enact export controls to limit [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2687.58s)]
*  Chinese access to semiconductors, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2690.58s)]
*  and whether the Prime Minister again urged [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2692.58s)]
*  President Biden, as he has done so many times, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2695.58s)]
*  if he would be open to joining CPTPP. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2698.58s)]
*  So on CPTPP, this is not an option we're exploring. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2701.58s)]
*  I think we've said that before. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2705.58s)]
*  We're focused on the IPEF, as you know, [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2707.58s)]
*  the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2710.58s)]
*  Negotiations and deepening our economic ties [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2712.58s)]
*  with those 13 partners, many of which are TPP partners. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2715.58s)]
*  So that is going to be our focus. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2720.58s)]
*  That has not changed. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2722.58s)]
*  As it relates, again, I don't want to get ahead [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2724.58s)]
*  of the conversation. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2726.58s)]
*  They're currently still having a dialogue. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2727.58s)]
*  The byline is still occurring. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2730.58s)]
*  But I expect they will discuss China, Russia, [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2732.58s)]
*  Russia's war against Ukraine, and the DPRK's unlawful [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2734.58s)]
*  nuclear and missile programs. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2737.58s)]
*  And the leaders will focus on what they can get done [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2739.58s)]
*  together in 2023. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2742.58s)]
*  Japan holds in the G7 presidency and has just taken [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2744.58s)]
*  a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2748.58s)]
*  While we're hosting the APEC and seeking to make shift [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2752.58s)]
*  progress on the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2756.58s)]
*  Prime Minister Kishida arrived at the White House, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2759.58s)]
*  as you all know. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2761.58s)]
*  I believe my colleague laid out what came out of that 2-plus-2 [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2762.58s)]
*  after consulting closely with us and regional partners [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2766.58s)]
*  in Europe. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2769.58s)]
*  And I expect the President and the Prime Minister Kishida [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2770.58s)]
*  will debrief on those consultations. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2772.58s)]
*  Again, don't want to get ahead of we're going to have [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2775.58s)]
*  a readout for you. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2777.58s)]
*  They're having this conversation currently. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2778.58s)]
*  And so once we have the readout this afternoon, [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2780.58s)]
*  we certainly will share that. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2782.58s)]
*  I can just dig a little bit deeper on IFAF, Graham, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2783.58s)]
*  because we really haven't heard much about this framework [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2785.58s)]
*  since it was launched last year. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2788.58s)]
*  So at this point, it seems like the administration still [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2790.58s)]
*  believes that this is the best offer that the U.S. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2793.58s)]
*  can give to counter Chinese trade clout. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2795.58s)]
*  Am I understanding this correctly? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2799.58s)]
*  So as you said, it was announced in Tokyo just this past May. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2801.58s)]
*  And Japan was a critical partner, as you know, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2805.58s)]
*  in helping us to build support, particularly among [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2809.58s)]
*  Southeast Asian countries. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2812.58s)]
*  So that is important. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2814.58s)]
*  Again, Japan has been a critical partner in this. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2815.58s)]
*  IPEF partners represent 40 percent of the world GDP, [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2818.58s)]
*  and we are united in our belief that much of our success [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2822.58s)]
*  in coming decades will depend on how well governments [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2825.58s)]
*  harness innovation. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2829.58s)]
*  So that is part of it, right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2830.58s)]
*  We got to see how this works through, especially the [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2831.58s)]
*  transformations afoot in the clean energy, digital [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2834.58s)]
*  technology sectors, while fortifying our economies against [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2837.58s)]
*  a rage of threats from fragile supply chains to corruption [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2841.58s)]
*  to tax havens. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2845.58s)]
*  So again, with Japan's partnerships and leadership in [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2846.58s)]
*  the negotiations, we expect to achieve high standard [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2849.58s)]
*  commitments that will deepen our economic engagement in [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2852.58s)]
*  the region and make good progress in text-based [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2856.58s)]
*  negotiations this year. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2859.58s)]
*  So this is a partnership that is incredibly important. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2860.58s)]
*  Japan played a very big role in it. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2863.58s)]
*  When you think about it, it represents the 40 percent of [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2865.58s)]
*  the world GDP. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2868.58s)]
*  And so, look, this is, again, an important partnership. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2869.58s)]
*  This is a framework that we are incredibly committed to, [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2872.58s)]
*  and we appreciate Japan's partnership in this. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2875.58s)]
*  The Press. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2878.58s)]
*  Can I have one on the bilateral? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2879.58s)]
*  Oh, yeah, yeah. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2880.58s)]
*  Go ahead, Ed. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2881.58s)]
*  Yeah, thanks, Graydon. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2882.58s)]
*  I want to ask you about the U.S. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2883.58s)]
*  Chamber of Commerce. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2884.58s)]
*  So the U.S. [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2885.58s)]
*  Chamber of Commerce embraced President Biden in 2020, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2886.58s)]
*  and now the President of the U.S. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2888.58s)]
*  Chamber says that the businesses it represents are [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2890.58s)]
*  fed up with the government making it harder to do [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2893.58s)]
*  business and adding new rules and regulations. [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2895.58s)]
*  Do you have any response? [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2897.58s)]
*  Yes, I do. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2898.58s)]
*  First thing, the President's first two years in office [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2899.58s)]
*  have been the best for job creation in history when you [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2902.58s)]
*  think about nearly 10.5 million jobs created. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2905.58s)]
*  Manufacturing and small businesses are on the rise, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2908.58s)]
*  and we are seeing progress in our fight against global [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2911.58s)]
*  inflation. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2914.58s)]
*  So that's the first piece to just lay out there. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2915.58s)]
*  The second, look, I don't think that it's all of the [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2918.58s)]
*  Chamber's presidents who said that. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2922.58s)]
*  She also called out polarization and gridlock and [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2924.58s)]
*  called for permitting reform, immigration reform, [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2928.58s)]
*  improving child care, improving climate resilience, [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2931.58s)]
*  and funding law enforcement. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2934.58s)]
*  So those are all areas where President has called for [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2936.58s)]
*  Congress to act, and we also agree with the Chamber that [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2939.58s)]
*  Congress must address the debt limit, and we can, quote, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2943.58s)]
*  not play chicken with the true faith and credit of the [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2946.58s)]
*  United States. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2949.58s)]
*  That's end quote. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2950.58s)]
*  And lastly, let me just say, as I think everyone is aware, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2951.58s)]
*  the last two years showed historic bipartisan progress [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2954.58s)]
*  for the American people. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2958.58s)]
*  I've talked about during this press briefing those pieces [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2960.58s)]
*  of legislation, again, historic pieces of legislation, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2965.58s)]
*  including on rebuilding our infrastructure and investing [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2968.58s)]
*  in American manufacturing. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2971.58s)]
*  So the President's plans on infrastructure, next [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2973.58s)]
*  generation research, clean energy, and manufacturing are [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2975.58s)]
*  strongly supported by business community. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2978.58s)]
*  Again, you know, we do outreach to different communities when [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2981.58s)]
*  we talk about these important pieces of legislation, when we [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2984.58s)]
*  talk about the President's economic plan, but he also [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2987.58s)]
*  believes big corporations should pay their fair share in [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2990.58s)]
*  taxes, and that's not just us. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2993.58s)]
*  That's also the American public who believes that they [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2995.58s)]
*  should be doing this. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2998.58s)]
*  Well, she said also that there's government regulatory [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=2999.58s)]
*  overreach, adding, and I'll quote her, when regulations [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3002.58s)]
*  are driven by ideological agendas and imposed on [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3005.58s)]
*  businesses without transparency, accountability, [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3008.58s)]
*  or clarity, government isn't working. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3011.58s)]
*  So will there be changes in its government work? [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3013.58s)]
*  I'll say this. [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3015.58s)]
*  Our administration is leveraging every available tool to advance [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3016.58s)]
*  the President's ambitious agenda for the country and to [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3019.58s)]
*  deliver for the American people. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3022.58s)]
*  That's the President's primary goal. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3023.58s)]
*  When he comes, when he came into the administration and it [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3025.58s)]
*  continues to be the case, he wanted to make sure that he's [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3028.58s)]
*  delivering for the American people, delivering for American [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3031.58s)]
*  families, making sure that we're building an economy from the [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3034.58s)]
*  bottom up, middle out, and that's what you are seeing. [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3037.58s)]
*  I was just asked about the inflation data, the CPI data, [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3040.58s)]
*  and the jobs report. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3043.58s)]
*  We are seeing, while there's still more work to do, we are [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3044.58s)]
*  seeing the economic, the President's economic policy is [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3047.58s)]
*  actually working. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3050.58s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3051.58s)]
*  Go ahead, Alex, in the back. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3052.58s)]
*  Yeah, Kareem, earlier this week we discussed the situation [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3054.58s)]
*  in Florida when I think about 350 Cuban migrants landing at [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3057.58s)]
*  Dry Tortuga in Key West. [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3062.58s)]
*  I believe you said it was a political ploy on the part of [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3064.58s)]
*  Governor DeSantis to deploy the National Guard. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3069.58s)]
*  His office has said that the Coast Guard requested help [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3073.58s)]
*  patrolling the waters off Florida. [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3077.58s)]
*  Can you just kind of discuss your understanding of the [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3080.58s)]
*  situation in Florida and how that understanding has developed [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3083.58s)]
*  in the last several weeks? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3087.58s)]
*  And I'm happy to repeat what I said, which is Governor DeSantis [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3089.58s)]
*  has made a mockery of the system, and he has consistently [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3092.58s)]
*  and constantly, as many of you have reported, has done political [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3098.58s)]
*  stunts, has not helped to address the issue, but has [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3102.58s)]
*  instead decided to put the lives of migrants who are coming here [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3105.58s)]
*  for a better life at risk. [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3110.58s)]
*  And that's what we have seen from this governor. [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3112.58s)]
*  Look, when it comes to the Coast Guard and Customs and Border [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3114.58s)]
*  Protection, they are deploying additional personnel and [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3116.58s)]
*  resources to Florida to quickly process individuals and place [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3119.58s)]
*  them in removal proceedings. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3122.58s)]
*  I would note that the migrants from Cuba who arrived in Florida [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3124.58s)]
*  over a week ago were processed and moved out of the state by [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3128.58s)]
*  Border Patrol within days. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3132.58s)]
*  At the national park that you mentioned, it reopened just this [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3134.58s)]
*  past Sunday. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3138.58s)]
*  The president has expanded safe, orderly legal pathways for [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3139.58s)]
*  migration, including for Cubans, and we continue to urge [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3143.58s)]
*  individuals to use those instead of risking their lives at the [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3147.58s)]
*  hands of human struggleers. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3152.58s)]
*  And you heard that directly from this president just a couple of [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3154.58s)]
*  days ago on the world stage in Mexico City. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3157.58s)]
*  I'm going to try and call folks I haven't, go ahead, Karen. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3160.58s)]
*  Folks I haven't called. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3163.58s)]
*  You've several times today referred people to the White House [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3164.58s)]
*  Council for questions about the process and the review. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3169.58s)]
*  Would you bring Richard Sauber here or someone from his team to [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3171.58s)]
*  answer these questions in the briefing room in a formal capacity? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3175.58s)]
*  So, look, the White House Council's office has provided [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3178.58s)]
*  information on this this week as appropriate. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3181.58s)]
*  Again, I think I just said this. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3184.58s)]
*  I've said this multiple times during this briefing that I know [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3185.58s)]
*  in the last 24 hours, my colleagues at the White House [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3189.58s)]
*  Council has been, White House Council office has been in touch [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3192.58s)]
*  with many of you and has answered a lot of your questions. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3195.58s)]
*  And so that will continue. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3198.58s)]
*  You reach out to them and they will certainly engage. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3200.58s)]
*  And so I'm going to leave it there. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3204.58s)]
*  But again, anything that is related to this review, I would [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3206.58s)]
*  send you to Department of Justice. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3210.58s)]
*  Again, if there is something specific to this that you want [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3212.58s)]
*  from us, I would refer you to the White House Council office. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3217.58s)]
*  And is the White House concerned that this investigation is going [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3220.58s)]
*  to overshadow what you are trying to do right now, what your [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3224.58s)]
*  message is right now? [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3227.58s)]
*  Look, our message is very clear and it will continue to be just that. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3228.58s)]
*  And you've seen it. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3233.58s)]
*  That's why when I started the briefing, I laid out all of the [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3234.58s)]
*  kind of progress that we have made just this week alone. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3239.58s)]
*  When you think about the Inflation Reduction Act, when [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3244.58s)]
*  you think about how it's going to lower costs for American [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3246.58s)]
*  families, when you think about the bipartisan infrastructure [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3249.58s)]
*  legislation, just recently as you all, some of you were there [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3253.58s)]
*  in Kentucky where you saw bipartisanship talking about a [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3256.58s)]
*  bridge that has for decades, for decades, presidents have talked [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3260.58s)]
*  about fixing that bridge. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3264.58s)]
*  And this president, because of the bipartisanship that he was [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3266.58s)]
*  able to bring together, got that done. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3269.58s)]
*  And so, look, we're not going to stop talking about how we're [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3271.58s)]
*  going to deliver for the American people. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3274.58s)]
*  I actually think, and we actually believe, there are people who are [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3276.58s)]
*  watching, the American people who are watching want to hear that. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3280.58s)]
*  They want to hear what I just laid out at the beginning of the briefing. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3283.58s)]
*  They want to know how this president, how this administration, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3286.58s)]
*  how the federal government is delivering for them. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3289.58s)]

*  data and how important it was to see inflation go down in six months [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3301.58s)]
*  and how we're seeing record low unemployment in 50 years. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O6qNoqevw4&t=3308.58s)]
