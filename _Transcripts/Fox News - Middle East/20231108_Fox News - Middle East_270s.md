# NBC News torched for headline on Jewish man's murder
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw)
*  Authorities searching for the suspect responsible for killing pro-Israel activist Paul Kessler [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=0.0s)]
*  during protest clashes between Israel and Palestinian supporters. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=5.4s)]
*  Police say his death is a homicide and they're not ruling out possible hate crime charges. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=9.36s)]
*  Listen. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=14.56s)]
*  Several witnesses were contacted at the northwest corner of the intersection where the Shell [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=15.56s)]
*  gas station is located and they were interviewed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=19.62s)]
*  These witnesses providing conflicting statements about what the altercation and who the aggressor [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=23.78s)]
*  was. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=28.44s)]
*  Some of the witnesses were pro-Palestine while others were pro-Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=29.64s)]
*  Rabbi Noah Parkus is the president and CEO of Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=34.0s)]
*  and he joins me now. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=38.64s)]
*  Rabbi, thanks for being here. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=39.8s)]
*  The officials went on to say, look, in order to decide ultimately what happened, they're [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=41.08s)]
*  asking for video from the public because these witness statements are contradictory and all [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=45.44s)]
*  over the place. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=50.44s)]
*  Are you confident that justice will be served? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=51.6s)]
*  I am because I've spoken with the chief of police and with the sheriff and with elected [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=55.64s)]
*  officials and there is an incredible amount of pressure that on the electeds, on the sheriff, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=62.0s)]
*  on the DA to make sure that a charge is brought and the rest is made. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=69.16s)]
*  We don't know what that charge will be yet that is subject to the investigation, but [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=73.56s)]
*  we demand that justice and we're pretty confident justice will be had. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=79.04s)]
*  How is the Southern California Jewish community dealing with the loss of Mr. Kessler? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=82.96s)]
*  Because I have to imagine it's hitting him pretty hard. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=88.47999999999999s)]
*  It is absolutely hitting us pretty hard. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=92.47999999999999s)]
*  The Kesslers are a wonderful family. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=95.88s)]
*  They do want their privacy during that time. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=97.72s)]
*  I think we should respect that, but the Jewish community writ large. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  They were sad, were angry, were kind of fed up. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=103.36s)]
*  You've got to remember this is the fourth incident this year alone of violent attacks [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  against Jews since the beginning of this year. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  There were two shootings in the Pico Robertson area. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=116.72s)]
*  There was a home evasion just a few weeks ago and now this. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=119.48s)]
*  We know that anti-hate against Jews is up almost 400% here in Los Angeles and the community [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=124.36s)]
*  is terrified. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  There are people who don't want to aware their religious paraphernalia. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=133.48s)]
*  There are people who don't want to go out to eat. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=138.88s)]
*  They don't want to go out to school. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=141.39999999999998s)]
*  And so this entire incident is just hitting the community very, very hard. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=143.56s)]
*  Does that fear extend to rallies, especially in light of what we've seen nationwide as [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=148.56s)]
*  well? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=152.88s)]
*  Is there a fear that, hey, if I go to a rally and support Israel, that I could suffer the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=153.88s)]
*  same fate as Mr. Kessler? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=157.67999999999998s)]
*  There is certainly the fear is there. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=160.64s)]
*  We are, I am encouraging folks to not give up because what's most important is our ability [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=162.68s)]
*  to express our First Amendment right, to assemble and to express our support for the Jewish [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=168.84s)]
*  people and the Jewish state. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=175.24s)]
*  And while we want people to be vigilant, we don't want people to engage in violence or [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=176.92000000000002s)]
*  retributive acts. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=182.32000000000002s)]
*  We do think it's important for us to show our solidarity. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=184.14000000000001s)]
*  There's a national rally coming on November 14th, and we hope to gather thousands and [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=187.84s)]
*  thousands of people on the National Mall in order to show our solidarity with Israel and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=193.84s)]
*  to show the unification of the Jewish people and our allies. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=198.96s)]
*  You're also up against a PR battle, and it doesn't help when NBC News releases a headline [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=202.12s)]
*  like this, quote, Man dies after hitting head during Israel and Palestinian rallies in California, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=206.96s)]
*  comma, officials say. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=214.4s)]
*  Now, look, they've since changed it. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=215.8s)]
*  What do you make of the failure by the media, NBC News specifically in this case, to actually [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=217.68s)]
*  say what is happening? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=222.96s)]
*  Because I have to think that if this were a Black Lives Matter individual who was in [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=225.6s)]
*  the same fate as Mr. Kessler, that you would have the specifics right there in the headline. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=229.52s)]
*  Yeah, no matter what news outlet it is, we need accurate reporting and we need to understand [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=236.56s)]
*  and take a victim-centered approach. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=242.38s)]
*  Paul Kessler was a 69-year-old man who was Jewish and pro-Israel, and that should be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  explicit in the headline. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=250.6s)]
*  And I'm not here to play politics on left and right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=252.16s)]
*  I just want to do what's right and what's right for the American people and what's right [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=254.44s)]
*  for the Jewish community specifically. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=258.96s)]
*  And so any headline needs to reflect reality on the ground. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=260.92s)]
*  Rabbi Noah Farkas, thank you so much for coming on the program this morning. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=265.36s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FTGSOnN8gFw&t=268.96s)]
