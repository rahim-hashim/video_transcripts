# John Kirby on early White House lid: I assure you the president is working
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s)
*  Alright, we are back here on the story. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=0.0s)]
*  John Kirby joining us, National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=3.18s)]
*  John, welcome. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  It's good to have you with us this afternoon. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=8.52s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=10.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=11.44s)]
*  So we know that there are nine Americans who lost their lives in this Hamas attack in Israel, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=12.44s)]
*  and we also understand that there are currently Americans being held hostage, correct? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  How many Americans are being held hostage at this hour, John? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=23.7s)]
*  The truth is we don't know, Martha. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=27.48s)]
*  I mean, certainly we've seen those reports, but we're not able to independently verify [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=29.240000000000002s)]
*  that Americans are indeed among the hostages. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=33.4s)]
*  Now, look, we have to accept the very grim possibility and the likelihood that there [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=36.28s)]
*  are Americans being held hostage. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=41.28s)]
*  We're in constant touch with Israeli officials right now to try to get a sense of the whereabouts [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=43.120000000000005s)]
*  of all the unaccounted for Americans, because who knows where they are or what condition [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=47.64s)]
*  they're in. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=53.08s)]
*  We want to make sure we get more detailed information on them. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=54.08s)]
*  Well, we understand that Hamas is putting some word out on social media that they plan [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=57.0s)]
*  to start executing hostages. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=60.64s)]
*  So obviously time is of the essence. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=63.08s)]
*  This is Robert O'Brien, the former national security adviser, when asked what he would [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=65.08s)]
*  do in this situation. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=69.28s)]
*  Watch. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=70.28s)]
*  We have hostage rescue teams in our special forces. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=71.82s)]
*  They need to be shipped immediately to get on those C-17s and C-5s and fly to Israel [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=75.68s)]
*  to prepare to rescue these American citizens. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=80.76s)]
*  We've got to have the FBI hostage rescue team also deployed to Israel. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=83.04s)]
*  I recommended this last night to save the Israelis, but we need to do it to save Americans now. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=87.12s)]
*  So we have some of the best hostage rescue teams in the world, as he points out. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=92.24s)]
*  Are they on their way to Israel right now, John? [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=95.72s)]
*  What I can tell you is that we have been in very close contact with Israeli officials [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=99.4s)]
*  about hostage recovery efforts. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=103.6s)]
*  Well, about everything, but certainly including hostage recovery efforts. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=105.36s)]
*  We're talking to them about resources and capabilities and needs that they might have [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=109.0s)]
*  that we might be able to help them with. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=113.04s)]
*  That's about as far as I'm able to go today, but clearly we are very, very focused on this [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=114.8s)]
*  problem set. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=118.68s)]
*  No question about it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=119.68s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=120.68s)]
*  So the president, the White House called a lid on the president at 11 46 a.m. this morning. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=121.68s)]
*  Given what is going on, John, why would that be? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=127.48s)]
*  Well, a lid means that he doesn't have any more public facing events. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=130.88s)]
*  It doesn't mean that the president's not working, and he absolutely is working. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=134.28s)]
*  He had another update this morning with his national security team. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=137.92s)]
*  He stayed updated throughout the day. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=141.76s)]
*  He's going to be talking to foreign leaders later this afternoon. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=143.88s)]
*  There will be a public component to that in terms of at least making it clear what that [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=147.04s)]
*  conversation was like and what the details of it were. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=150.48s)]
*  We'll be putting that out and making sure people know what that conversation was all [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=153.2s)]
*  about. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=156.83999999999997s)]
*  Is the president at the White House right now, John? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=157.83999999999997s)]
*  He is indeed. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=159.11999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  So why put a lid on today? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=162.11999999999998s)]
*  You know, there might be multiple opportunities when he might want to come out and address [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=163.11999999999998s)]
*  some of what's going on. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=167.0s)]
*  Given this urgent situation, you've got American hostages in Israel and nine Americans dead. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=168.68s)]
*  So doesn't that seem like a little odd to do on a Monday? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  A lid again is an administrative decision about whether or not there's a scheduled public [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=175.68s)]
*  event after the fact. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=179.72s)]
*  But obviously, lids can be lifted. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=182.28s)]
*  Lids can be changed. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=183.88s)]
*  You know that. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=184.88s)]
*  You've covered the White House. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=185.88s)]
*  I don't have any public events to speak to today. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=186.88s)]
*  I can assure you and I can assure the American people that the president is staying up to [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=189.44s)]
*  date has been throughout the extent of this crisis and will continue to do so going forward. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=193.04s)]
*  And again, part of his plan this afternoon is to get on the phone with foreign leaders [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=197.96s)]
*  and talk to them about what's going on in Israel. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=201.64s)]
*  OK. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=204.76s)]
*  So now the United States is essentially involved in a war in Europe as we give a tremendous [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=205.92s)]
*  amount of military aid to Ukraine as they fight Russia. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=212.92000000000002s)]
*  We also say that we are rock solid in our support of Israel as they now face a battle [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=217.12s)]
*  that is against and we can get into this in a moment, but supported by Iran by all accounts. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=223.84s)]
*  So given that the United States is now involved in wars that are taking place in Europe and [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=230.64000000000001s)]
*  also in the Middle East, I want to play this soundbite for you that is just last month [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=236.12s)]
*  in Vietnam and ask you if this still holds for the president watch. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=242.28s)]
*  The only existential threat humanity faces, even more frightening than a nuclear war, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=247.28s)]
*  is global warming going above 1.5 degrees in the next 10 years. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=255.28s)]
*  Given all the nuclear players in these two areas where we are now engaged on, does the [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  president stand by that comment? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=266.12s)]
*  Absolutely he does. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=267.96000000000004s)]
*  Climate change is an existential threat. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=269.22s)]
*  It actually threatens and is capable of wiping out all human life on Earth over time. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=270.8s)]
*  I don't know how more existential you can get to that, but that doesn't mean that we [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=277.8s)]
*  walk away from our obligations, our national security interests in very dangerous parts [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=281.04s)]
*  of the world. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=285.24s)]
*  But John, he said it was more frightening than a nuclear war. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=286.24s)]
*  Is that, it's more frightening than a nuclear war in this moment? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  The president believes wholeheartedly that climate change is an existential threat to [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=295.44s)]
*  all of human life on the planet. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=300.32s)]
*  That's just science. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=302.2s)]
*  That's a fact, Martha. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=303.2s)]
*  But it doesn't mean that we turn our back on the other challenges facing this country [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=304.2s)]
*  and our allies and partners around the world. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=307.92s)]
*  We've got broad national security commitments literally globally and we've got to mind all [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=309.92s)]
*  of them at the same time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=314.52s)]
*  You mentioned two of them. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=315.68s)]
*  Obviously Israel right now, certainly Ukraine over the last almost two years now. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=316.68s)]
*  We are a big enough and powerful enough and effective enough nation to be able to look [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=321.54s)]
*  after all these disparate national security threats. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=326.1s)]
*  And one of them absolutely is climate change. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=328.70000000000005s)]
*  Does the United States believe that Iran was behind this attack? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=330.82s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal says it was. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=336.1s)]
*  Can you confirm that for us? [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=339.86s)]
*  I'm not able to confirm that specific reporting, Martha. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=341.54s)]
*  We're obviously going to look at this very, very hard. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=344.90000000000003s)]
*  We have been. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=346.70000000000005s)]
*  We just haven't seen any evidence or intelligence as you and I are speaking right now that points [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=347.7s)]
*  to direct Iranian participation in these attacks. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  That's why does the Wall Street Journal have that and the White House doesn't look, I'm [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=356.26s)]
*  not going to speak about intelligence matters and what we're collecting here on national [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=359.98s)]
*  TV. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=364.74s)]
*  That said, though, Martha, make no mistake. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=365.74s)]
*  And we've been very honest about this. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=367.8s)]
*  Iran, of course, is complicit in these attacks because of its longstanding support to Hamas [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=369.46s)]
*  and other terrorist networks in the region. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=374.56s)]
*  That's why we have got more than 400 sanctions against them. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=376.85999999999996s)]
*  That's why we beefed up our presence not only in the Gulf area, but now in the Eastern Mediterranean. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=379.38s)]
*  We're going to make sure that we can protect our national security interests against what [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=385.34s)]
*  is a growing threat throughout the region by Iran. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=389.11999999999995s)]
*  So we have reported that the Gerald Ford aircraft carrier is in the region now in the Eastern [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=392.34s)]
*  Mediterranean. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=398.5s)]
*  It's the most up to date top of the line that we have. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=399.5s)]
*  So that has gone into the region, as you point out. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=403.78s)]
*  The $6 billion that the Qataris are holding that was unfrozen in order to get three hostages [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=407.3s)]
*  back, John, that, you know, you said, well, there are strings attached to that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=413.38s)]
*  Is that money now going to be refrozen? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=420.0s)]
*  I don't want to get any of any policy decisions going forward here, Martha. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=422.94s)]
*  As I said last time, you and I talked about this, that money can be refrozen at any time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=427.94s)]
*  Doesn't that seem like a good time to do that? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=433.18s)]
*  We won't hesitate to make that decision if we feel we need to. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=436.06s)]
*  But I'm not going to get ahead of a policy decision that hasn't been made yet. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=438.26s)]
*  Again, and I think it's important to remind your viewers that that money will never get [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  seen by the Iranian regime. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=445.54s)]
*  They never get to touch it or feel it or spend it. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=446.82s)]
*  It goes to approved vendors that we approve to get in medical supplies and food and whatnot [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=448.98s)]
*  to the Iranian people. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=453.5s)]
*  We don't have a beef with the Iranian people. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=454.54s)]
*  But you accept the fact that that Iran understands that $6 billion has been unfrozen and that [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=456.1s)]
*  puts them in a position to spend money on things like a tax. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=463.82s)]
*  This attack was reported to be underway in the planning in August and September. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=468.62s)]
*  That money was sent to them in September. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=474.78s)]
*  So that would change their thinking about their future line of credit that they have, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=477.12s)]
*  no? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=481.82s)]
*  No, I disagree, Martha. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=482.82s)]
*  First of all, they haven't, none of that money has been allocated or gone into Iran yet. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=483.82s)]
*  They don't get access to it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=489.02s)]
*  It is only for humanitarian purposes. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=490.58s)]
*  The other thing, and you and I have talked about this, is it's not like the $6 billion, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=492.18s)]
*  they can just cut a check for all of it. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=495.54s)]
*  They'd have to piecemeal it over time. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=497.22s)]
*  Well, they've said they can use it however they want. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=498.7s)]
*  And it would be very difficult to see that that money would somehow give them financial [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=500.38s)]
*  relief. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=504.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, this is a nation state. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=505.46000000000004s)]
*  Well, we all know money is fungible, so it changes your psychology. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=506.46000000000004s)]
*  If I know I've got a $7,000 credit line that I didn't know I had, I might decide that I'm [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=508.38s)]
*  going to spend a few thousand dollars on something I've been wanting to do. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=513.66s)]
*  Well, that's just my whole point, Martha. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=516.74s)]
*  There's not a credit line. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=518.0600000000001s)]
*  It's set up for humanitarian assistance. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=519.3s)]
*  The Trump administration did the same thing. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=520.78s)]
*  We don't have a beef with the Iranian people, but none of that money has been allocated. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=522.98s)]
*  We can refreeze it at any time. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=526.0s)]
*  All right, so we're going to wait, I guess. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=528.18s)]
*  No commitment for refreezing at the moment, but we'll wait to hear that. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=530.42s)]
*  I have one last question for you. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=533.14s)]
*  151 people on the terror watch list have crossed our southern border. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=535.02s)]
*  Given the fact that U.S. and Israeli intelligence did not pick up on this terrorist attack that [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=540.5s)]
*  happened in Israel, what is being done to lock down those individuals who now are somewhere [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=547.98s)]
*  in the United States? [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=552.1s)]
*  I don't have any specific law enforcement actions to speak to today. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=554.0600000000001s)]
*  Obviously, we monitor threats to our national security from inside and outside the country, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=558.02s)]
*  all in real time. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=564.3000000000001s)]
*  Law enforcement and intelligence community are watching as closely as they can and monitoring [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=565.5s)]
*  this. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=570.5s)]
*  I would say, look, there's going to be a time and a place for us to take a look at the intel [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=571.5s)]
*  picture and what was known, what wasn't known. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=574.54s)]
*  That's not the time now. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=577.3399999999999s)]
*  The time now is to support Israel, make sure they have what they need to defend themselves. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=579.0s)]
*  But are we more concerned about attacks along these lines by terrorists here in the United [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=582.5s)]
*  States, given that we have 151 new people in the country who snuck across the southern [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=585.54s)]
*  border? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=590.26s)]
*  Always concerned about terrorist attacks on the American people here at home. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=591.38s)]
*  That hasn't changed since 9-11. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=594.5799999999999s)]
*  It's not going to change under this administration. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=595.5799999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=597.62s)]
*  John, thank you, as always. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=598.62s)]
*  It's good to have you. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=599.78s)]
*  Thank you for taking our questions. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=600.78s)]
*  Obviously, everybody's watching this and thinking about the people in Israel and everything [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=603.1s)]
*  that they are undergoing, especially our American hostages, who we know our government is going [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=606.78s)]
*  to work very hard to bring home. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=611.9399999999999s)]
*  And we thank you for being here, sir. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=614.22s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=615.62s)]
*  Yes, ma'am. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=616.62s)]
*  We share those concerns. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=617.62s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1us6RYnJ26s&t=618.62s)]
