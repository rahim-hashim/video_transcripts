# Israeli president has TENSE exchange with reporter over Gaza airstrikes
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI)
*  So the Israeli president had a bit of a tense exchange with reporters during a press conference. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=0.0s)]
*  We want to share this moment with you. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=6.32s)]
*  He is considered to be mild-mannered as a leader, but watch his reaction to questions [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=8.68s)]
*  about the retaliatory strikes that are happening in Gaza. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=15.44s)]
*  He seemed to hold the people of Gaza responsible for not trying to remove Hamas. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=18.8s)]
*  No, well, I'll tell you. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=25.0s)]
*  Let me finish. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=26.0s)]
*  Do you hold a missile in your kitchen, in your living room? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=27.0s)]
*  Can I ask my question? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=29.96s)]
*  A missile that is sent on our head here, and if there will be a siren, it's a missile from [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=30.96s)]
*  that kitchen. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=34.92s)]
*  With all due respect, if you have a missile in your kitchen and you want to shoot it at [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=36.04s)]
*  me, am I allowed to defend myself? [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=42.2s)]
*  Yes. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  No one is. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  That's the situation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  But the question is this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=47.480000000000004s)]
*  Ultimately, you can't remove the people of Gaza. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=48.88s)]
*  They're going to be stuck in this neighborhood. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=51.72s)]
*  So we have to fight. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=53.2s)]
*  What do you want us to do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=54.88s)]
*  So we tell them, get out, and we fight against the launchers. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=56.36s)]
*  We are fighting terror. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=60.16s)]
*  Humanity has to decide. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=61.92s)]
*  Are we accommodating terror or are we fighting terror? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=63.92s)]
*  We are fighting terror. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=68.56s)]
*  There are many, many innocent Palestinians who don't agree to this. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=69.56s)]
*  But unfortunately, in their homes, there are missiles shooting at us, at my children, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=73.48s)]
*  at the entire nation of Israel. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=79.28s)]
*  We have to defend ourselves. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=81.68s)]
*  We have the full right to do so. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=82.84s)]
*  And it's about time that the world understands it. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=85.0s)]
*  This is the tragedy of using terror. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=89.36s)]
*  And terror has noâ€”there's no mercy to terror. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=92.92s)]
*  Yasser Khodad media organizations during that moment, too. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=95.28s)]
*  He wants all media organizations to label Hamas as a terrorist organization. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=98.44s)]
*  Having spent a lot of time in that part of the world, a couple things come to mind. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=104.32s)]
*  Even 20 years ago, when Yasser Arafat was alive, and between the years 2000 and 2005, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=108.92s)]
*  one of the biggest problems Israel had at the time was the suicide bombings. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=114.80000000000001s)]
*  And they could not stop them. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=117.92s)]
*  They could not get them under control. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=119.12s)]
*  They hit them at weddings. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  They hit them at bus stops all over Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=121.80000000000001s)]
*  And that's when they started to build that wall that separates Israel proper from the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=124.64s)]
*  West Bank. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=128.44s)]
*  And then when Ariel Sharon pulled out of Gaza in 2005, the question was, what do we do now [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=130.04000000000002s)]
*  to protect ourselves? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=137.08s)]
*  And they came to this grand conclusion toward, I'd say five years ago, Dana, now, where [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=139.36s)]
*  they built this fence with a wall that they thought was loaded with electronics that could [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=144.12s)]
*  protect them forever. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=149.64000000000001s)]
*  And clearly that failed. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=152.12s)]
*  In the summer of 2006, on the northern part of Israel, with the border with Lebanon, the [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=154.68s)]
*  Israelis in Hezbollah fought a war that summer, lasted six to eight weeks. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=164.0s)]
*  And this was, I would argue this, it was a crude form of warfare on behalf of Hezbollah. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=169.83999999999997s)]
*  They had rockets in their homes called katushas. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=176.0s)]
*  Now this is, what, 15, 16 years ago? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=179.95999999999998s)]
*  Those rockets had no ability to, they had no GPS. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=183.88s)]
*  You could not target them. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=188.76s)]
*  You're essentially running out in your driveway, shooting off a katusha rocket, and maybe it [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=190.39999999999998s)]
*  hits a house or maybe it hits a kibbutz or maybe it takes out Israelis. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=195.16s)]
*  But the Israelis had cleared out all the northern part of their country, so the amount of loss [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=199.92s)]
*  of life was minimal. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=203.64s)]
*  And what many people are watching right now, we just showed you the map in southwestern [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=206.92s)]
*  Israel. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=209.92s)]
*  We'll show you the map a bit later too about northern Israel. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=210.92s)]
*  That part of the border has held so far. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=213.16s)]
*  There's been a few threats, but the international community is watching to see whether or not [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=216.24s)]
*  Hezbollah takes action in the north. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=220.48s)]
*  Hezbollah, believe it or not, is so much more equipped than Hamas is in Gaza. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=223.2s)]
*  Keep that in mind as we cover this. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=228.52s)]
*  Really good perspective on that. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=229.88s)]
*  And also please join the Fox Corporation in supporting the Israeli Emergency Fund. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=231.32s)]
*  Your money will go to services like aid for military families, equipment for public hospitals, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=236.12s)]
*  and trauma counseling for the thousands living in bomb shelters. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=241.12s)]
*  You can visit the United Jewish Appeals website or just scan the QR code on the screen if you [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=244.76s)]
*  would like to donate and join us in that effort. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=249.68s)]
*  And they could use that, right? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Zx89MyASYI&t=251.56s)]
