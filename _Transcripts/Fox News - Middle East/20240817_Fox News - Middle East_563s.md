# ‘I hope, I wish’ for a ceasefire deal: Former Israeli Prime Minister
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04)
*  All right, peace talks are expected to continue tomorrow in Cairo, I'd say on Monday in Cairo, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=0.0s)]
*  after really going nowhere in Doha. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=9.8s)]
*  And it doesn't help matter that Hamas is not being a direct participant in these talks, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=12.08s)]
*  working through intermediaries, which is why Benjamin Netanyahu has serious doubts as to [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=16.4s)]
*  whether anything could come to fruition in that environment. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=20.76s)]
*  Ehud Barak is kind enough to join us right now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=23.84s)]
*  You remember, of course, as the former Israeli prime minister. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=27.32s)]
*  Prime Minister, thank you for joining us. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  Do you think there will be a ceasefire deal, Prime Minister? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=36.32s)]
*  I hope. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=41.8s)]
*  I wish. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=42.8s)]
*  It's what really needed for sure for the families, to the people of Israel, and I believe that [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=43.8s)]
*  for other reasons, to the outside as well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=50.760000000000005s)]
*  But I am very skeptical, because we have been seeing in the last several months, let me [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=54.2s)]
*  say honestly, that whenever it comes close, something happens. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=60.84s)]
*  Unfortunately, I should admit, usually from our side, which makes it impossible to continue. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=65.4s)]
*  So the real responsibility is on the Hamas. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=72.76s)]
*  Hamas is a terrible guy. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=75.16s)]
*  He deserves to be eliminated from us. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Having said that, at least for six weeks now, there is a document on the table of the Americans [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=82.03999999999999s)]
*  and the moderators, which Netanyahu agreed to. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=90.8s)]
*  The other side, surprisingly enough, was ready to negotiate. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=95.08s)]
*  And then there came certain reservation and second thought from our side, which blocked it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=100.36s)]
*  Prime Minister, do you get the sense that if there is a ceasefire, and I know you're [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=107.32s)]
*  skeptical as to whether it will ever come to pass, that Iran might not respond to the [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=113.0s)]
*  attacks on prominent Hezbollah and Hamas leaders that prompted its threat to retaliate? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=120.84s)]
*  That if there is a deal, that it's not going to do that? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=126.52s)]
*  First of all, I don't know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=130.52s)]
*  Several players, probably even the Americans, are trying to create the impression that if [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=134.83999999999997s)]
*  only there is a breakthrough, there will be no response from Hamas. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  Probably it has certain truths. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  There are certain debates there, but it's basically autocracy. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=145.88s)]
*  The Khamenei will decide. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=149.16s)]
*  Probably they will separate themselves from the Hezbollah. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=152.04s)]
*  They will let the Hezbollah operate. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=156.2s)]
*  And in fact, the Hezbollah possible response is much more massive and coming from close [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=158.44000000000003s)]
*  distance, so there is no enough time to intercept all the missiles, the rocket coming. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=164.60000000000002s)]
*  So they might delay their own response. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=170.28s)]
*  I don't believe that they will fully give up their right, so to speak, to respond. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=172.92000000000002s)]
*  But probably they might delay to several weeks or probably several months. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=179.56s)]
*  Prime Minister, we have learned that when Benjamin Netanyahu spearheaded these attacks [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=183.79999999999998s)]
*  on some of these Hamas and Hezbollah operatives, he didn't give the U.S. much of a heads up, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=188.44s)]
*  if any. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  How do you feel about that? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=194.68s)]
*  Would you have done the same? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=195.88s)]
*  Look, I think that basically the kind of policy, it's a justified policy. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=199.79999999999998s)]
*  Justified policy. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=205.72s)]
*  The world is a better place to live in without those gentlemen who disappeared. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=207.0s)]
*  And as you know, Israel never admitted that it's behind the assassination of Hanier. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=213.32s)]
*  But having said that, it means they should be considered very carefully in cold head, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=221.8s)]
*  not out of certain demand from the public, of the boiling blood to do something. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=229.16s)]
*  We are in this business for decades. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=235.96s)]
*  Since I was a, you know, a personnel, a special forces having to do it with my own ten fingers. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=238.6s)]
*  It should be considered cautiously, carefully, with clear perception of what exactly is the [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=246.28s)]
*  balance. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=253.64s)]
*  What are we getting to get? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=255.07999999999998s)]
*  What we are risking? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=256.6s)]
*  So, as I understand it, the Mosul that you took out, the house was booby trapped and [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=259.88000000000005s)]
*  had been for weeks, maybe months. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=267.32000000000005s)]
*  And that makes many people wonder what other homes and facilities are booby trapped in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=269.8s)]
*  that region. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=275.88s)]
*  So obviously there's a lot you can't share, but obviously in Iran, that seems to give [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  them pause, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=283.16s)]
*  No, I think the Iranians feel a great humiliation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=284.2s)]
*  Hanier was there for the inauguration of the new president. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=289.64s)]
*  They hosted him in the kind of secure place of the revolutionary guards. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=294.12s)]
*  So they got humiliated. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=300.44s)]
*  I cannot fully penetrate their souls and their consideration. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=303.0s)]
*  They are now a part of a newly emerging strategic global axis made of China, Russia, Iran, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=309.0s)]
*  North Korea. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=317.08s)]
*  They are fighting for influence. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=317.8s)]
*  They are fighting for certain military targets now in Ukraine. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=320.12s)]
*  They are fighting for the sympathy of the global south. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=324.28s)]
*  So probably they have certain limitations stemming out from these axes that which have [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=327.72s)]
*  much higher priorities. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=334.6s)]
*  Now, first of all, Ukraine, what happens there around Kursk is quite dangerous from the [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=336.20000000000005s)]
*  Russian point of view. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=341.32s)]
*  Iran happened to be, it's an irony of history. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  Iran is a major supplier of advanced technology to Russia. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=346.04s)]
*  Who could think about it 20 years ago? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=351.0s)]
*  And they are a major supplier of oil to China. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=353.32000000000005s)]
*  And the oil fields are probably the first target that might be heard if there is a major [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=357.16s)]
*  clash with Israel. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=362.20000000000005s)]
*  So they have several considerations and they are known to be patient. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=363.08s)]
*  They are chess players, not the Begamo or Czechos. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=368.12s)]
*  Prime Minister, Donald Trump has said repeatedly on the campaign trail, none of this would have [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=375.47999999999996s)]
*  occurred down to Hamas's attack on your country back on October 7th if he were president. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=380.36s)]
*  Do you agree with that? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=387.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=388.44s)]
*  I cannot pass a judgment on if in history it's a quite unstable kind of ground. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=389.96s)]
*  It's natural for everyone who was not there to think that if he were there it was better. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=399.48s)]
*  And you might find some people in Israel who would say if I would have replaced Netanyahu, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=404.84s)]
*  it would never have happened. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=409.72s)]
*  And so I don't think that we have to, in this regard, look to the Americans. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=411.64s)]
*  We have to look inside, in the mirror, and find what exactly happened and how. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  In reality, the polls in Israel say that until now, even 10 months after the beginning of the war, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=426.12s)]
*  still four out of five Israelis see the main responsible in Netanyahu as a prime minister [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  because he was in power for 15 years and he came to power promising that he is the only one who can [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=438.28s)]
*  destroy Hamas. It ended up with October 7th and with the worst-led war in our history. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=443.64s)]
*  But of course he's not alone. There are the heads of the army, the heads of the intelligence. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=452.52s)]
*  There are more than one guy responsible. But three out of four Israelis, the Daltis, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=457.96s)]
*  believe that Netanyahu has to resign, including an extremely significant fraction of his own voters. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=463.48s)]
*  So basically it's clear that he's legally the prime minister, but he totally lost the trust [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=470.52000000000004s)]
*  of the public. And it calls for a change, for thinking seriously on changing the team at the [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=477.16s)]
*  top. Even the judicial reform that he promised at the opening of the war, that he will put it aside, [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=487.88s)]
*  he will not touch it as long as there is a war, it is run on steroids right now. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=496.36s)]
*  Six weeks ago there was a ruling of the Supreme Court saying clearly, in clear Hebrew words, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=501.8s)]
*  the general attorney, she's a tough lady, she is the law in between any two major [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=509.96s)]
*  decisions of the Supreme Court. And the executive branch has a, not opportunity, but commitment to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=517.4s)]
*  obey her directive. And Netanyahu patently breaks it and to the rest of my judgment, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=526.92s)]
*  brings Israel to the verge of de facto dictatorship that should be stopped. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=536.04s)]
*  All right. Well, what's what happens is a lot that still has to be resolved to your point, [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=542.92s)]
*  Prime Minister, but very good having you on, sir. Thank you very much. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=546.5999999999999s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVqfhkwXl04&t=551.7199999999999s)]
