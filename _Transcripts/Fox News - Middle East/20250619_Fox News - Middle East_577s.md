# Exiled crown prince of Iran sends message to Trump as he considers bunker-buster strike
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg)
*  In 1979, a massive revolution in Iran brought about the Ayatollah Khomeini to power. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=0.0s)]
*  The then Shah of Iran and his wife, Her Imperial Majesty Farah Pahlavi, were forced out of their [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=8.8s)]
*  homeland. This is them leaving at the airport. But under the Ayatollahs, the freedom that they [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=16.0s)]
*  promised never materialized. In fact, they cracked down, beating and imprisoning women who refused to [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=20.72s)]
*  wear the hijab, gay Iranians, anyone who dissents. Now the son of the late Shah, his Royal Highness [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=27.44s)]
*  Reza Pahlavi, who has been in exile, is advocating for a new future for Iran. He says he believes [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=35.92s)]
*  that the moment is now. He posted this on social media. Quote, the Islamic Republic has reached [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=45.2s)]
*  its end. It is in the process of collapsing. Khomeini, like a frightened rat, has gone into [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=51.44s)]
*  hiding underground and has lost control of the situation. What has begun is irreversible. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=57.92s)]
*  I spoke with him moments ago, the exiled Crown Prince of Iran. Here's our talk. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=64.24s)]
*  Crown Prince, thank you very much for joining us at this historic moment in time. It's good to have [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=71.36s)]
*  you with us. Good afternoon, Martha. Good to be with you as well. Tell me, first of all, [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=77.44s)]
*  Crown Prince, what is your understanding of what is actually the situation on the ground right now [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=82.88s)]
*  in Iran? The latest report that we have had, Martha, is that the control apparatus of the regime [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=89.52s)]
*  is almost collapsing. And we see more and more of that sort of reports that are coming to us from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=96.88s)]
*  personnel within the military or intelligence that says so, that it's really falling apart, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=105.6s)]
*  much faster than it was, let's say, last week. The problem, however, is that the regime has [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=112.24s)]
*  cut off the nation from any communication, internet, and even landlines are down. Families [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=121.35999999999999s)]
*  that are trying to figure out what's happening to their loved ones cannot communicate. And I hope [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=127.11999999999999s)]
*  that we can overcome this problem very soon so the nation is not detached or unable to communicate, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=132.0s)]
*  which, as you know, is crucial for anything that needs to be done. The regime is so desperate that [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=137.76s)]
*  it's now taking this initiative to impede on the process. But I know it will overcome this. It's a [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=143.44s)]
*  big challenge. And my competitors are extremely resilient. Many of them have stood in Tehran, [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=150.24s)]
*  besides those who have left the capital city. And their resolve is amazing. Their courage is [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=158.96s)]
*  really amazing. So shout out to them that, despite all the hardship, they believe that this time [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=164.48s)]
*  victory is near and we need that courage and that moral support that the world needs to also give [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=170.48s)]
*  us that this time they're going to be on our side rather than continue thinking that this regime [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=175.76s)]
*  will ever provide a solution. Historic opportunity to put an end to all the problems, not just the [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=180.32s)]
*  nuclear threat, but every other thing that has been associated with this regime ever since it [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=185.52s)]
*  took over. And I think my competitors have proven that despite the threats, despite the repression, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=190.32000000000002s)]
*  despite being executed, besides being tortured, besides being shot in the eye, they're still in [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=196.16000000000003s)]
*  the streets standing firm and hopefully at some point the world will say now it's time for us to [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=200.96s)]
*  step in and allow for this process to take its natural course, help the Iranian people overcome [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=207.68s)]
*  this regime, because everybody as a result will benefit, not just my competitors, of course, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=213.68s)]
*  but I think many people around the world will understand how different in Iran, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=219.12s)]
*  different Iran could be for all of us. We know that President Trump is currently considering [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=223.6s)]
*  the use of a bunker buster bomb on the Fordo facility in Iran, which is believed to have a [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=229.44s)]
*  nuclear facility buried deep into the ground. What would you say to President Trump as he [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=235.52s)]
*  considers that option? One of the concerns that often is associated with hitting nuclear facilities [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=241.84s)]
*  is the risk of radiation that could be something very important to contemplate. I hope it doesn't [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=250.48000000000002s)]
*  get to this point. I think there's enough damage done to the regime without having to take it to [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=255.44s)]
*  the next level. But if the objective finally is for this regime to completely collapse, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=260.24s)]
*  the better elements, much stronger than a bomb and much more effective, are the people themselves. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=265.36s)]
*  I'll tell you something, Martha, in the past 48 hours, and of course even before that, but [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=270.88s)]
*  especially as a result of this latest campaign, many elements within the military have reached out [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=275.92s)]
*  to me. They're communicating the fact that they're ready to defect, they're ready to peel away from [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=281.92s)]
*  the regime, they're willing to join with the people and demonstrate that to the people, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=288.96s)]
*  some elements within the intelligence sector as well as the bureaucratic setup. We are seeing [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=293.92s)]
*  more and more defections beginning to take place, which is something that I anticipated, I have called [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=300.96000000000004s)]
*  for, because they realized that it's pointless to stay there and try to defend a regime that doesn't [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=305.68s)]
*  care about the nation, that doesn't care about our country. And at the end of the day, some [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=312.56s)]
*  proud nationalists, they believe in Iran's territorial integrity, they believe that their [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=318.24s)]
*  job is to protect the nation, not to kill people under the regime's orders. So this element is one [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=322.47999999999996s)]
*  of the factors that is beginning to happen. I hope that in any consideration that we have, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=329.52s)]
*  including President Trump, he realizes that this is something that is beginning to become more and [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=334.79999999999995s)]
*  more tangible. So I think a strategic cause might be required at some point to allow that process to [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=339.91999999999996s)]
*  demonstrate itself and allow the regime to start falling on its own weight, so to speak. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=346.32s)]
*  And we are leaving these moments as I speak to you right now. So I hope it doesn't get to a point [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=352.15999999999997s)]
*  that we have to go even further. But again, I'm not a military strategist or am I an advisor to [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=357.28s)]
*  the president. I'm just telling you that Iranians would hope that instead of our country being [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=363.36s)]
*  targeted militarily, and as painful as it is as a patriot to see that my country has been [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=369.44s)]
*  attacked, I've always thought that we should try to avoid at the most possible such confrontation, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=376.16s)]
*  just because diplomacy has failed, and instead allow for the process of change at the hand of [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=383.36s)]
*  the people themselves to take place. So I hope that they consider that as a critical factor, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=388.16s)]
*  as opposed to our only option after failed diplomacy is further military strikes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=392.72s)]
*  Understood. So you would not want to see the United States use this bunker buster [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=398.0s)]
*  at Fordow. Is that correct? You would discourage that. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=405.76s)]
*  Well, I hope that as the regime is crumbling, is that enough of a factor to have neutralized [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  the situation that it cannot do anything harmful, at least in the immediate? Because the whole [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=417.84s)]
*  argument about striking is because of the imminence of the regime's threat. But they've been completely [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=423.52s)]
*  dismantled. The apparatus of air defense, the apparatus of retaliation is almost taken out. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=429.84s)]
*  So I think that sort of pushes back a little bit the envelope, which would allow sufficient time [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=435.84s)]
*  for another phenomenon to occur, which is the one I just explained to you, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=442.48s)]
*  allow the Iranian people to overcome this regime, help them do that, because that option is always [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=446.15999999999997s)]
*  on the table. But what's the rush here? People are to them the ultimate factor. That's what [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=452.32s)]
*  scares the regime the most. So the more the people are empowered, the quicker we can reach that end. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=458.56s)]
*  So you have said that you don't seek power, but you are ready to fulfill a duty, if called upon. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=464.56s)]
*  If the people supported or asked you to return as Shah for a period of time during transition, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=472.72s)]
*  would you be open to that option? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=482.72s)]
*  I don't think I need a title to perform as a transitional leader. I think the reason people [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=486.48s)]
*  are looking for me to play that role is because of their confidence in me, their trust in me, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  and I think to a great extent the track record that I've demonstrated in the past 44 years [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=496.56s)]
*  since I've begun. And that trust in me allows me to play that national leader role, if you will, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=501.28s)]
*  and be able to be the element that reassembles people together on a common agenda, knowing that [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=508.32s)]
*  we might differ in opinion, but we are committed to the democratic outcome. So I don't think I need [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=514.4s)]
*  to have any particular title that will be putting the carrot before the horse, so to speak. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=520.0s)]
*  Let us be focused on the job at hand. The job at hand is A, eliminate this regime and replace it [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=527.2s)]
*  with a secular democratic alternative. And this is exactly the end game that I'm looking at, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=534.0s)]
*  and I'm not looking past that one at this time. I'm focused only on this mission, and I hope my [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=540.32s)]
*  competitors will understand that we need not prematurely discuss issues that will be determined [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=545.6s)]
*  down the line. So he's encouraging the people to change the trajectory in Iran more so than [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=551.12s)]
*  the potential of a bomb destroying Fordo. So we're going to have more of our conversation in just a [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=560.48s)]
*  moment. Hey, Sean Hannity here. Hey, click here to subscribe to Fox News YouTube page and catch our [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCjJdkOqhTg&t=564.4s)]
