# Ret. Navy SEAL: Palestinian prisoners released under hostage deal 'will have impacts down the road'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc)
*  Our coverage of today's second hostage release continues. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=0.0s)]
*  13 Israeli women and children and four Thai nationals [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=2.94s)]
*  set free after 50 days in captivity [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=6.48s)]
*  in Gaza's network of tunnels [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=8.98s)]
*  in exchange for 39 Palestinian prisoners Israel was holding. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=11.02s)]
*  The IDF says those freed hostages are now in Israel. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=15.66s)]
*  Let's bring in Mike Cirelli, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=20.8s)]
*  a retired Navy SEAL officer and former recon Marine. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=22.18s)]
*  He is also CEO of Talent War Group. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=25.62s)]
*  As you look at this hostage negotiation, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=29.84s)]
*  the swap, you know, Palestinian prisoners [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=33.6s)]
*  for Israeli and Thai hostages [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=36.16s)]
*  and the others released yesterday, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=38.92s)]
*  what's your big picture thinking, Mike, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=41.04s)]
*  about how all of this is going and turning out? [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  Well, John, let me say this. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  My heart goes out to the families [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=48.0s)]
*  that have been reunited with their loved ones. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  There's no great way to ease their pain, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=52.24s)]
*  but in the larger context, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=54.64s)]
*  what you have is Hamas who's emboldened by this ceasefire, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=56.519999999999996s)]
*  especially in a deal where three Palestinian prisoners [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=60.199999999999996s)]
*  are released for every one military hostage. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=63.44s)]
*  Hamas is overplaying their hand here. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=65.92s)]
*  They believe they're in a strong position [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=67.88s)]
*  because they're winning the information war [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=69.39999999999999s)]
*  and this relentless anti-Israel media campaign [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  across the globe, which includes, unfortunately, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=75.32s)]
*  a lot of Americans in the street. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=78.92s)]
*  What I'm fearful about and what Lucas just brought up [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=81.14s)]
*  is that in that exchange of 1,000 Palestinian prisoners [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=84.28s)]
*  in 2006, amongst them was Yahya Sinwar, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=87.88s)]
*  who's one of the leaders of Hamas [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=92.16s)]
*  in the mastermind of the October 7th massacre. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=93.52s)]
*  So we've got to be cautious about the decisions [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=97.08s)]
*  and the prisoners we release today. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=99.16s)]
*  It will have impacts down the road. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=100.84s)]
*  So what would be your advice to the Israelis? [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=103.12s)]
*  I mean, you know war. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=105.8s)]
*  They have said that they are not going to let up in Gaza [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=108.44s)]
*  until all of those prisoners, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=111.56s)]
*  all of those hostages are released [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=113.92s)]
*  and until Hamas is eradicated. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=115.48s)]
*  Can they do that? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=118.78s)]
*  They can. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=121.36s)]
*  You know, Israel has a phrase from the Holocaust, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=122.28s)]
*  never again. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=126.08s)]
*  That should be the end goal, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=127.24000000000001s)]
*  is the eradication of Hamas [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=128.52s)]
*  and bringing all of the hostages home, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  whether dead or alive, preferably alive. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=132.94s)]
*  But you've got to understand too [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=136.08s)]
*  that this deal is playing to Hamas. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=138.16s)]
*  It's a win-win for Hamas. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=142.44s)]
*  If Israel, which is between a rock and a hard place, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  if they didn't do this, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=149.07999999999998s)]
*  they would not be viewed as a civilized democracy [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  committed to diplomacy and solving problems. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=153.07999999999998s)]
*  But John, let's not forget, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=156.12s)]
*  there is no diplomacy when dealing with terrorists. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=158.04s)]
*  So I think this is a strategic, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=162.6s)]
*  morally strategic dilemma for Israel. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=165.8s)]
*  And quite frankly, I think it's extremely fragile [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=169.96s)]
*  and eventually combat operations will resume. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=172.88s)]
*  You mentioned the fact that there are so many [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=175.84s)]
*  pro-Palestinian protests around the globe. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=178.12s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz wrote an interesting piece [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=183.0s)]
*  in which he was forced to remind the world [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=185.1s)]
*  that first of all, the Palestinian people in Gaza [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=189.12s)]
*  elected Hamas as their leadership back in 2006. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=192.4s)]
*  And he reminded us that there was that Hamas terrorist [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=197.76000000000002s)]
*  on October 7th who picked up a phone and called home [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=204.08s)]
*  and said, oh, mom and dad, I'm so excited. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=208.12s)]
*  You should be so proud of me. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=210.32s)]
*  I killed 10 of these Jews. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=211.68s)]
*  And his father says, oh, congratulations, son. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=214.58s)]
*  That's great. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=217.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, it's hard to separate the Palestinian people [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=218.04s)]
*  from Hamas, which is the government that they elected. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=224.35999999999999s)]
*  John, it's sanity in the insane world. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=229.2s)]
*  About two Sundays ago, I went to brunch with my wife [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=233.2s)]
*  here in Austin, Texas. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=235.44s)]
*  And as we stepped into the restaurant, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=237.12s)]
*  there was all these young college kids [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=239.22s)]
*  wearing Palestinian headdresses [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=240.76s)]
*  for a pro-Palestinian demonstration. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=242.24s)]
*  And I found it so odd. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=246.92000000000002s)]
*  What I think a lot of Americans lack is perspective, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=248.12s)]
*  which we can say is lack of world travel. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=251.24s)]
*  They haven't been to third world countries [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=253.72000000000003s)]
*  or war torn countries. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=256.48s)]
*  And they don't understand. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=257.96000000000004s)]
*  Now, if this massacre, this brutality, dismemberment, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=259.36s)]
*  mutilation, rape, decapitation took place in America, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=265.36s)]
*  we would not forget. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=269.74s)]
*  We would not soon forget. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  And I think I need to remind the American people [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=272.76s)]
*  during 9-11, Palestinian people were celebrating [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=275.98s)]
*  in the streets at the loss of 3,000 American lives. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=280.22s)]
*  We can never let our memory be a short memory. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=283.70000000000005s)]
*  It's gotta be long standing. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=287.62s)]
*  And Hamas has said, Hamas doesn't care about it [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=289.32s)]
*  to two country state. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=292.74s)]
*  They care about the destruction of Israel [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=295.14000000000004s)]
*  and the annihilation of all Jews. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=298.38s)]
*  They've said it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=300.82s)]
*  That is their goal. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=301.78000000000003s)]
*  You have obviously been a warrior as a Navy SEAL. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=303.02s)]
*  I'm sure you have been on some, you know, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=308.02s)]
*  intense hostage rescue efforts. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=310.18s)]
*  When you see these hostages coming out, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=315.18s)]
*  we just had a picture up of the Sheba Medical Center, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=317.65999999999997s)]
*  which is where this latest batch of 17 [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=320.53999999999996s)]
*  is going to be taken for medical evaluations. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=323.14s)]
*  But it must, well, tell us about the war. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=327.14s)]
*  What goes through your mind when you see, you know, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=333.02s)]
*  these folks being released after 50 days [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=336.53999999999996s)]
*  in the hands of terrorists? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=340.26s)]
*  Well, John, I appreciate saying I'm a warrior, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=343.34s)]
*  but I'll tell you, I was surrounded by them. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=345.58s)]
*  Lucky to be around them. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=347.58s)]
*  With a hostage rescue mission, it is the one mission [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=349.14s)]
*  where the guys will put their lives at risk [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=352.46s)]
*  for speed to get to the hostages as quickly as possible. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=354.9s)]
*  And there have been many cases [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=357.71999999999997s)]
*  where during a active gunfight, [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=359.08s)]
*  our service members have jumped on a hostage, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=361.72s)]
*  not knowing if they're going to be shot [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=364.64000000000004s)]
*  in the back to protect them. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1AEYCmI7pc&t=365.84000000000003s)]
