# Geraldo: If Iran wanted to hit US troops, they would have
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4)
*  Joining me now, Geraldo Rivera, Fox News correspondent at large, who has reported from this entire [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=0.0s)]
*  region, spent time, been at Al-Assad, all of these places that we're talking about right [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=4.64s)]
*  now. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=8.68s)]
*  So those are two sides of the story. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=9.68s)]
*  You just heard the Vice President say that they believe that Iran is telling these militias, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=10.68s)]
*  you know, take a knee, essentially, at this point. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=15.16s)]
*  And Kamenei says this is not the end of it. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=18.68s)]
*  Well, if the reports on the militias being told to stand down are true, it is in keeping [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=22.12s)]
*  with my original thesis that they did not intend to kill Americans last night. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=29.0s)]
*  You know, these are the people that took down our drone. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=35.24s)]
*  They put a cruise missile barrage right in the middle of the Saudi oil fields. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=37.64s)]
*  I think they could put a ballistic missile in a car window if they so desired. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=42.36s)]
*  Remember the reports, Martha, that the Iraqis had been forewarned by the Iranians and that [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=48.2s)]
*  the Iraqis obviously told us Al-Assad is a huge base. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=53.2s)]
*  They really looked like hangars were targeted. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=57.36s)]
*  If they wanted to hit the barracks or hit the places where American GIs were, I submit [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=60.16s)]
*  that they would have. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=64.64s)]
*  But remember how soon afterwards the Foreign Minister Zarif said this was it, they were [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=66.44s)]
*  standing down, it was over, and then President Trump came right after Zarif and reinforced [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=71.72s)]
*  that, and that's just a couple of hours afterward. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=77.32s)]
*  It would seem to me that if Iran was indeed seeking to kill American GIs, that entire [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=80.0s)]
*  country would have hunkered down. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=86.2s)]
*  They would have warned their population, they would have warned their military that the [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=88.16s)]
*  Armageddon was coming their way. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=92.36s)]
*  That was a red line that could not be crossed. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=94.92s)]
*  So, I mean, they needed to do some response. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=96.64s)]
*  They promised that they would. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=99.67999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that there were many people in Iran who expected it, despite the fact that, as [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=100.75999999999999s)]
*  we heard earlier tonight, a lot of the Iranian people were glad that Soleimani was gone. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=104.52s)]
*  This is from Foreign Policy, from foreignpolicy.com. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=110.0s)]
*  Iran's revenge plans are bigger than missile strikes. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=114.08s)]
*  Iran will use the networks that Soleimani built to avenge his death. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=117.12s)]
*  These things take time, right? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=122.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody can look at this situation and feel like, okay, this is over at this [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=123.84s)]
*  point. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=128.48s)]
*  That's exactly why I think that killing Soleimani was a terrible idea that was brilliantly executed. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=129.48s)]
*  I understand the tactics involved. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=135.04s)]
*  They knew where he was, when he was going to be there, they popped him. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=137.24s)]
*  I get that. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=141.2s)]
*  It's a target of opportunity. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=142.2s)]
*  But what? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=143.32s)]
*  What did we win? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=144.32s)]
*  What was the end result? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=146.32s)]
*  The argument is saving American lives. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=147.79999999999998s)]
*  Saving American lives. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=149.79999999999998s)]
*  That's the argument. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  You don't believe that? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  Two months ago, this guy was fighting alongside us against ISIS, against Al-Qaeda, against [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=152.79999999999998s)]
*  al-Nusra. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=157.64s)]
*  Come on. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=158.64s)]
*  How could the guy go from monster to ally to monster in such a short time? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=160.0s)]
*  I think that we need a plan for the Middle East. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=164.48s)]
*  We need a plan for our relations with that region. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=168.51999999999998s)]
*  They're oil self-sufficient now. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=171.28s)]
*  Let somebody else worry about it. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=174.16s)]
*  Why put our GIs in harm's way? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=175.72s)]
*  Right now they're just targets. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=178.16s)]
*  So pull them all out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=179.16s)]
*  I think Eric and I, my wife, Erica, who you know and I, last night we were watching, we [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=180.52s)]
*  were thinking about these 18-year-old, 19-year-old, 20-year-old GIs. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=184.68s)]
*  They're just targets. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=188.04000000000002s)]
*  What the hell are they doing there holding their M16s or their weapons? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  Do you think the president is of that mind ultimately? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=192.44s)]
*  I think he is. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=195.20000000000002s)]
*  That he wants to get everybody out? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=196.20000000000002s)]
*  That's why I was so disappointed by the killing of Soleimani. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=197.20000000000002s)]
*  The president said the Trump doctrine is to bring our forces home and only respond where [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=199.56s)]
*  it is in America's national interest. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=205.24s)]
*  Who are we helping here other than the Saudis? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=207.96s)]
*  Who are we helping? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=210.4s)]
*  Perhaps the Iranian people ultimately. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=211.4s)]
*  Well, you know, I saw the report with Lara Logan, who I have the highest regard for. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=212.68s)]
*  I think that we overstate the opposition in Iran. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=217.04s)]
*  They've been very resilient since 1979. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=222.76s)]
*  Those crowds. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=225.96s)]
*  A lot of unhappy people in that country. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=226.96s)]
*  A lot. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=227.96s)]
*  I have no doubt. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=229.36s)]
*  Let's say a third. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=230.36s)]
*  1500 people killed by Soleimani and the regime. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=231.36s)]
*  I saw millions of people in the streets for Soleimani's funeral. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=233.12s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=236.4s)]
*  Did they all get there by coercion? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=237.4s)]
*  I think that we have been wishful thinking about Iran for decades now. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=238.72s)]
*  Geraldo, thank you. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=242.8s)]
*  Always good to hear your side. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=243.8s)]
*  Thanks for coming in tonight. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i4TI6wEiqd4&t=244.8s)]
