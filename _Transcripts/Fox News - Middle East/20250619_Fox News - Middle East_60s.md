# Karoline Leavitt: Trump is a ‘peacemaker in chief’
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A)
*  Well, in those deadlines, as you've seen in respect to Russia-Ukraine, might I add, these [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=0.0s)]
*  are two very different, complicated global conflicts, as you know, that the president [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=5.0s)]
*  inherited from our previous incompetent president in the weakness of the previous administration. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=8.96s)]
*  And the president has spent a tremendous amount of time and effort cleaning up these crises [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=14.36s)]
*  that were caused by the last administration's just complete dereliction of duty on the world [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=18.62s)]
*  stage and American weakness. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=23.48s)]
*  Now we have American strength again. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=24.88s)]
*  With respect to Russia and Ukraine, because of that American strength and the president's [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=26.68s)]
*  leadership, we have seen these two sides engage in direct negotiations. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=31.080000000000002s)]
*  And the last time the president said two weeks, you saw Russia and Ukraine have direct negotiations [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=34.92s)]
*  for the first time in years. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=39.620000000000005s)]
*  And so the president is always interested in a diplomatic solution to the problems and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=41.24s)]
*  the global conflicts in this world. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=45.36s)]
*  Again, he is a peacemaker in chief. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  He is the peace through strength president. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=49.2s)]
*  And so if there's a chance for diplomacy, the president's always going to grab it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=51.6s)]
*  But he's not afraid to use strength as well. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  I will add. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkIiZbVoL_A&t=56.52s)]
