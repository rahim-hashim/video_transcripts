# 'MURDEROUS TERRORIST': Democrat argues Israel is 'justified' to strike Hezbollah
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8)
*  Joining me now, Delaware Democratic Senator Chris Coons, member of the Senate Foreign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=0.0s)]
*  Relations Committee. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=3.44s)]
*  Welcome back, Senator. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=4.8s)]
*  Good to have you. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=5.8s)]
*  Thanks, Shannon. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=6.8s)]
*  It's always good to be on with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=7.8s)]
*  I want to start here with what Prime Minister Netanyahu said at the U.N. just days ago. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=8.8s)]
*  As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice and Israel has every [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=14.3s)]
*  right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=20.44s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're doing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  He went on to imagine, ask Americans to imagine what would happen if towns like El Paso and [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=28.44s)]
*  San Diego border towns were taking incoming fire turned into complete ghost towns. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=33.04s)]
*  He says American officials would not stand for that for a single day. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  And yet this administration continues to call for a ceasefire. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=41.480000000000004s)]
*  You know incoming has been happening since October 8th. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=44.72s)]
*  Why should we ask them to stand down? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  Do you think that's the right thing to do? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=49.72s)]
*  Well, let's be clear, Shannon. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=51.400000000000006s)]
*  Vice President Harris put out a forceful statement, as did President Biden, that I join in [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  saying that Hassan Nasrallah, the leader of Hezbollah, is a murderous terrorist who had [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=58.24s)]
*  American blood on his hands from the attack on the American Marine barracks back in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=62.42s)]
*  1980s. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=66.76s)]
*  And he's killed thousands of innocent civilians, Lebanese, Syrian, as well as Israeli. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=68.0s)]
*  And as you said in your question, they have been raining rockets and missiles onto northern [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=73.88s)]
*  Israel since October 7th. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=78.72s)]
*  So I think Israel is justified in their strikes against Hezbollah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=80.56s)]
*  The call for a ceasefire is really because of a concern that a ground invasion of southern [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=85.72s)]
*  Lebanon by the IDF might well turn into a long and grinding war of attrition and concerns [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=90.64s)]
*  that Iran may well now retaliate. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=96.96s)]
*  But President Biden and Vice President Harris are clear that we will stand by our ally Israel [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=99.82s)]
*  and defend them against attacks by Iranian proxies or direct attacks by Iran. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=104.74s)]
*  One of your GOP colleagues, Senator Ron Johnson, sees it differently. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=110.03999999999999s)]
*  He says that Israel doesn't have the ability to fully trust us at this time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=113.24000000000001s)]
*  Here's what he said yesterday. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=117.4s)]
*  They always seem to want to throttle back Israel's ability and desire to defend itself. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  I think it's a very sad fact that Israel doesn't trust the United States under the leadership [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=126.64s)]
*  of President Biden and Vice President Harris. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  They just can't trust us. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=134.64000000000001s)]
*  They don't have to ask our permission, but there are things they're doing. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=136.12s)]
*  We're finding out when they're actually in play or after the fact. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=138.52s)]
*  What do you make of your colleagues' assessment there that they can't trust us? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=142.24s)]
*  Ron's statement is just nonsense. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  No one has been stronger in coming to the defense of Israel, especially after the hateful [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  attacks by Hamas on October 7th, then President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=154.0s)]
*  In fact, in the first ever direct attack on Israel by Iran, the Biden-Harris administration [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=159.20000000000002s)]
*  coordinated a response by several of our close allies that ensured that none of the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=165.44s)]
*  300 missiles and drones that Iran launched at Israel hit any significant target or caused [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=170.54s)]
*  any major damage. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=176.9s)]
*  We have stood by Israel faithfully and loyally throughout the entire period that there are [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=178.1s)]
*  repeated attacks by Hezbollah and by Hamas on the territory of Israel and by the Houthis [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=183.7s)]
*  on commercial shipping in the Red Sea. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=189.5s)]
*  So they should trust us. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=191.62s)]
*  There have been some moments of tension because they don't inform us of what they're doing [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=194.1s)]
*  before they do. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=198.34s)]
*  There is some question, of course, about the number of civilian deaths in Gaza as that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=199.42000000000002s)]
*  war has ground on. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=204.54000000000002s)]
*  But the idea that there should be any question about Joe Biden and Kamala Harris standing [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=205.9s)]
*  strongly by Israel and their right to defend themselves from attack, just nonsense. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=210.70000000000002s)]
*  Want to turn to another foreign hotspot, which obviously is Ukraine and Russia. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=215.14000000000001s)]
*  President Zelensky here in town asking for things this week, meeting with the candidates, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=219.54000000000002s)]
*  meeting with the current administration. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=223.42000000000002s)]
*  What he really wants is the ability to use Western weapons deeper into Russia. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=225.3s)]
*  Putin out today, a spokesman for the Kremlin saying they're considering changing their [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=230.42000000000002s)]
*  policy and their guidelines when it comes to the use of nuclear power. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=235.66s)]
*  Is that a threat? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=239.82s)]
*  Is it bluffing? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=241.98000000000002s)]
*  What do you think that the administration should do with respect to allowing those weapons [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=243.18s)]
*  for further use into Russia? [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=246.94s)]
*  Well, we need to be careful because Vladimir Putin has shown that he's willing to take [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=249.34s)]
*  risks and gambles. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=254.1s)]
*  Most of the world did not expect him to engage in the full broad spectrum and invasion of [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  Ukraine back in 2022. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=261.1s)]
*  And President Biden and Vice President Harris have masterfully assembled a global coalition [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=263.34s)]
*  of 50 countries to defend Ukraine, to support Ukraine in their fight for freedom. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=268.38s)]
*  One of the more alarming things that President Trump and his running mate, J.D. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=273.58s)]
*  Vance, have said is that they will somehow bring this war to an end in a day. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=277.3s)]
*  And J.D. Vance in the Senate has questioned whether we should continue to support Ukraine's [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=281.86s)]
*  fight for freedom. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=286.94s)]
*  I think it's important that we give them the weapons, the tools and the freedom to use [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=288.26s)]
*  those weapons in order to win this war against Russia. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=293.02s)]
*  But I respect that President Biden gets more detailed briefings than I do on the potential [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=296.7s)]
*  risks of escalation. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=302.58s)]
*  And when President Putin makes threats to potentially use tactical nuclear weapons, he [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=304.42s)]
*  has a very tough balancing act to strike. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=309.74s)]
*  Well, were you encouraged by the meeting between President Trump and President Zelensky, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=312.22s)]
*  because they came out of it and seemed that they had met, you know, had some kind of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=316.18s)]
*  meeting of the minds, that they heard each other. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=320.38s)]
*  I mean, President Trump said, you know, it hasn't changed where he is overall on trying [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=322.02s)]
*  to get this thing ended. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=325.38s)]
*  But even President Zelensky and he talked with our Griff Jenkins, too, sounded like he [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=326.74s)]
*  felt like it was a good meeting. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=329.98s)]
*  I'm glad they met. It's important that there be conversations between President Zelensky [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=331.74s)]
*  and both Republican and Democratic leaders of our nation and candidates to be the next [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=337.3s)]
*  president of our nation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=342.74s)]
*  But in the clip that you're showing right now, President Trump said, I'm a very good [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=343.94s)]
*  friend of Putin's. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=348.3s)]
*  And you could see Zelensky sort of stiffen up and go, well, I hope you're a better friend [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=349.5s)]
*  of Ukraine than you are a friend of Russia under Putin. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=354.97999999999996s)]
*  So it was a strikingly awkward moment. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=358.9s)]
*  Putin is a war criminal. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=361.62s)]
*  Putin has carried out horrific attacks in Ukraine. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=363.06s)]
*  We should not have a president of the United States saying that he is seeking to be a [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=366.3s)]
*  better friend of Vladimir Putin. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=370.26s)]
*  OK, well, I want to ask you before you go quickly about our own border, because we got [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=372.62s)]
*  numbers from ICE late in the week that showed a picture that was pretty shocking for most [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=375.94s)]
*  Americans, that there are hundreds of thousands of non-citizens here who have already [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=379.98s)]
*  been convicted of a crime and are not in ICE custody. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=384.14s)]
*  That includes by their numbers more than 13000 people convicted of homicide. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=387.02s)]
*  Were those numbers a shock to you? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=391.98s)]
*  And what can and should we be doing about people, you know, get upset talking about [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=393.86s)]
*  mass deportations, but targeting people that have been convicted criminals, murderers, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=398.46s)]
*  rapists, should we not have an effort to get that done? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=402.86s)]
*  Shannon, thanks for a chance to talk to that, because that's a misleading number. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=406.3s)]
*  Those 13000 convicted of homicide, they may not be in ICE custody, but most of them are [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=410.46s)]
*  in prison, state, federal or local prisons, and will be deported as soon as they [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=416.38s)]
*  finish serving their prison terms. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=421.14s)]
*  Under the Biden-Harris administration, they have prioritized the deportation of those [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g8oMqCf_Wq8&t=423.53999999999996s)]
