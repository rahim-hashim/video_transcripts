# Biden delivers remarks on protecting Social Security and Medicare
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 01, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k)
*  She is not only one of my best friends in the United States Congress. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=0.0s)]
*  I know I don't look it, but I served 36 years in the Congress. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=5.68s)]
*  And I spent time working with Debbie. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=10.92s)]
*  She wasn't there nearly that long when I was there. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=13.32s)]
*  But my point is we became good friends because she has enormous integrity, enormous integrity. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=15.52s)]
*  She has a sense, a sense of understanding what people are going through. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=23.0s)]
*  And she plays it out. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=27.44s)]
*  She works it out. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=28.68s)]
*  And so she was one of my biggest, biggest supporters in helping me not only pass, but [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=30.24s)]
*  draft and move some of the legislation we're going to talk about today, a couple pieces [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=36.28s)]
*  of it. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=40.56s)]
*  And I don't have a greater friend in the United States Senate. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=41.56s)]
*  And I don't have a greater friend when I was vice president nor as president. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=45.04s)]
*  So Debbie, thank you, kiddo. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  I don't know anymore where you're sitting, but there you are, Debbie. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=55.24s)]
*  Last time I was in Florida was almost a month ago because of Hurricane Ivan, I-N, excuse [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=58.2s)]
*  me. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=64.16s)]
*  And we surveyed the damage in the ground in Fort Myers and it was the surrounding communities [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=65.16s)]
*  by air, helicopter. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=69.84s)]
*  The damage and destruction was historic, almost, almost unimaginable. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=72.04s)]
*  And I've said then that it's going to take not weeks or months, but years to fully recover [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=77.88s)]
*  and rebuild. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=82.58s)]
*  But I also made a commitment. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=83.58s)]
*  I made a commitment to my administration, the federal government would give the people [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=85.84s)]
*  of Florida the commitment that we're going to not move until it's all done. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=89.6s)]
*  We're going to stick with you until it gets all done. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=93.8s)]
*  And look, my administration has been through, going to follow through on those commitments [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=97.12s)]
*  to get the people of Florida what they need as fast as they can get it and to help to [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=101.52s)]
*  rebuild. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=105.72s)]
*  So far, we put in through the legislation Debbie helped me pass as well, $1.7 billion [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=106.72s)]
*  in federal grants. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=114.2s)]
*  Disaster loans and flood insurance payments have been provided to the state in small businesses [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=116.2s)]
*  and households. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=122.84s)]
*  FEMA has made assistance available to 26 counties and will provide temporary housing for the [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=123.84s)]
*  survivors of those six counties. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=130.2s)]
*  We've sent 24 disaster recovery centers across the state for survivors to register for help. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=132.92s)]
*  And FEMA, Federal Emergency Management Assistance, has gone door to door to reach people as [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=139.36s)]
*  well. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  They've also performed over 180,000 home inspections, 180,000 personal inspections. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=146.20000000000002s)]
*  The U.S. Small Business Administration has approved $460 million in low interest business [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=153.20000000000002s)]
*  loans for renters and homeowners. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=159.22000000000003s)]
*  Like I said, this is just the beginning of the effort and we're going to be with you [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  every step of the way. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=165.3s)]
*  And by the way, the very piece of legislation I'm talking about today contained $369 billion [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=167.2s)]
*  for environmental protection. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=174.32s)]
*  Folks, well, I've come to Florida today to talk about two very, very, very important [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=176.32s)]
*  programs, two very important that's going to affect as many Americans as anything else. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=187.08s)]
*  And a great deal of people in this state are going to be affected. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=192.32s)]
*  And they're under siege by our Republican friends. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=196.72s)]
*  And by the way, this ain't your father's Republican party. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=200.12s)]
*  This is a different deal right now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=202.56s)]
*  And there's a lot of good Republicans out there, but they're under a lot of pressure. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=204.88000000000002s)]
*  Social Security and Medicare are the two things I want to talk about. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=210.48000000000002s)]
*  You know, they've been around a long time. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  President Roosevelt signed the Social Security law in the law 87 years ago. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=216.64000000000001s)]
*  And Lyndon Maynes Johnson signed Medicare into law 50 years ago. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=221.84s)]
*  These programs, these programs are do something so basic, it's so important. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=226.72s)]
*  Almost half of all seniors in the United States lived in poverty before Social Security. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=233.2s)]
*  Let me say that again. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  50 percent, almost 50 percent of all the seniors in America lived in poverty before, before [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=239.28s)]
*  this law was passed. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=245.32s)]
*  Almost half the seniors, half of them lived in poverty. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=246.84s)]
*  Even those who spent a lifetime working. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=250.64s)]
*  Not enough to put food on the table until Medicare came along, no health care they could [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=253.92s)]
*  count on. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=258.36s)]
*  And think about what that does to your sense of security, what it does to a person's dignity. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=259.36s)]
*  Unless you were wealthy, people often worked until they took their last breath. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=265.88s)]
*  They couldn't even think about retiring. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=270.92s)]
*  And if they did, they'd starve. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=272.44s)]
*  Then along came, we came together as a country. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=275.88s)]
*  Democrats and Republicans said we have to do better than this. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=279.52s)]
*  After working hard for decades, people deserve better than what existed at the time. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=282.76s)]
*  They deserve to retire with dignity and peace of mind. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=288.44s)]
*  And that's how it should be in the United States of America. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=292.0s)]
*  Some of you are on Social Security or your parents or your grandparents are. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=296.24s)]
*  They earned it. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=300.56s)]
*  They earned for earned every single paycheck they put money in since they were teenagers [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=301.56s)]
*  to pay for Social Security. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=307.44s)]
*  And those are more than government programs. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=310.12s)]
*  They're a promise, a promise we made as a country to work hard and contribute. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=312.24s)]
*  When it comes time to retire, we're going to be there for you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=318.44s)]
*  We're going to be there for the basic needs. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=321.72s)]
*  That's been a rock solid guarantee. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=324.72s)]
*  An ironclad commitment. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=326.68s)]
*  Generations, generations of Americans have counted on it. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=329.6s)]
*  And it works. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=333.8s)]
*  The number of elderly people living in poverty is plummeted since Social Security was created. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=335.28s)]
*  It's transformed millions of people's lives. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=340.88s)]
*  Here in Florida, 21 percent of the people are over the age of 65. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=343.84s)]
*  It's the second highest of any state in the country, as a percent of their state. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=348.28s)]
*  Some of our people are of means, but the vast majority live day to day relying on Social [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  Security and Medicare and maybe a little help from their families. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=356.91999999999996s)]
*  That's why I'm going to keep fighting for these programs because I believe the word [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=361.15999999999997s)]
*  my dad used all the time, everyone's entitled to be treated with dignity. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=365.08s)]
*  How? [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=369.52s)]
*  I mean, it's basic. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=370.52s)]
*  Basic stuff. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=374.68s)]
*  How could a child look at their mom and dad and not be able to afford to take care of [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=376.96s)]
*  them and still maintain their own dignity? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=382.52s)]
*  I believe hard work should be rewarded. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=386.91999999999996s)]
*  And I believe that we should leave no one behind, not in the United States of America. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=389.32s)]
*  So that's why we passed the Inflation Reduction Act, which Debby helped write, pass and monitor [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=394.4s)]
*  all the way through. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=400.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=401.44s)]
*  And there are a number of parts to it, but I want to talk about one. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=402.44s)]
*  I want to talk about Medicare. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=409.52s)]
*  Every single Democrat in the United States Congress voted for the Inflation Reduction [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=412.03999999999996s)]
*  Act. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=415.88s)]
*  Every single one. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=418.2s)]
*  Every single one voted for it. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=420.15999999999997s)]
*  Not one single Republican voted for it in the House of Senate. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=422.92s)]
*  Take prescription drugs. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=428.40000000000003s)]
*  Folks, we pay the highest price for prescription drugs than anywhere in the world. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=429.88s)]
*  The prescription you have from a drug manufacturer in the United States you get at the local [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=435.44s)]
*  drug store. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=440.68s)]
*  You get in a plane and fly to Paris, you can get the same exact drug for less. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=441.68s)]
*  Every other major capital in the world. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=447.48s)]
*  How can that be? [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=449.92s)]
*  Why is that the case? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=451.6s)]
*  The very same prescription by the very same company. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=453.84000000000003s)]
*  For years, for years, many of us have tried very hard to bring prescription drugs under [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  control. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  But for years, Big Pharma has stood in the way. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=464.84000000000003s)]

*  I remember starting this battle when I was a 35-year-old United States Senator. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=469.28000000000003s)]
*  Over the past year, drug companies raised the price to make a reference to what my introducer [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=474.16s)]
*  said, raised the price on 1,200 drugs more than the rate of inflation. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=480.6s)]
*  Let me get something clear here. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=487.68s)]
*  Hold for a second. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=488.68s)]
*  Let me make something clear. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=489.68s)]
*  It's not they did anything more to the drug, more research and development on that particular [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=491.52000000000004s)]

*  They did nothing. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=496.76000000000005s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=497.76000000000005s)]
*  Same exact drug with no change. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=498.76000000000005s)]
*  I understand if they have a breakthrough in that drug and make it more effective and charge [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=500.88s)]
*  more. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=505.36s)]
*  I get that. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=506.36s)]
*  But none of that. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=507.36s)]
*  None. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=508.36s)]
*  The average price for those drugs was raised over 30 percent. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=509.6s)]
*  In 2022, the price of one blood pressure medicine, one that millions of Medicare recipients are [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=514.64s)]
*  relying on every day, increased 500 percent. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=523.6s)]

*  Just changing the price. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=549.8800000000001s)]

*  You know, we're dealing with it for a couple of seconds. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=556.08s)]
*  Inflation is a worldwide problem right now because of a war in Iraq and the impact on [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=559.24s)]
*  oil and what Russia is doing. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=564.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, excuse me, the war in Ukraine. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=565.56s)]
*  And think of Iraq because that's where my son died. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=567.88s)]
*  The because he died. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=573.56s)]
*  But the point is that they're, you know, that's why it's up. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=575.56s)]
*  We have the lowest inflation rate of almost any major country in the world. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=579.52s)]
*  We've done a lot to try to take it under control. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=583.9599999999999s)]
*  I've released millions of barrels of oil from our strategic petroleum reserve, keeping the [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=586.92s)]
*  price down. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=591.48s)]
*  It's down about $1.25 and going down. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=592.48s)]
*  It needs to go more. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=594.76s)]
*  But they talk about inflation all the time. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=596.6s)]
*  What in God's name? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=599.88s)]
*  And they ask why I call this the Inflation Reduction Act. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=600.88s)]
*  If you have to take a prescription that cost you an arm and a leg, and I reduce that, you [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=605.4s)]
*  don't have to pay as much. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=611.08s)]
*  It reduces your cost of living. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=612.72s)]
*  It reduces inflation in your paycheck. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=615.0s)]
*  And by the way, I'm serious. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=616.88s)]
*  My dad used to say everybody deserves a little bit of breathing room. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=622.8s)]
*  Granted, when the price of a gas or a gallon of gasoline went up, we talked about it at [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=626.08s)]
*  our kitchen table. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=630.72s)]
*  We weren't poor. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=632.24s)]
*  We were an average middle class family. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=633.24s)]
*  We lived in a three-bedroom split-level house in a development in a suburban area. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=634.24s)]
*  We were in a situation where, you know, we had four kids and a grandpop living with us. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=638.76s)]
*  But we weren't poor. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=645.84s)]
*  But we didn't have any money. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=648.12s)]
*  We didn't have any leftover. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=649.12s)]
*  And so it was, you know, do you have anything left to have a little bit of breathing room? [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=651.8399999999999s)]
*  Look what's happening to drug prices on average Americans. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  It's actually outrageous. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=659.24s)]
*  But this year, we finally beat Pharma. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  We finally beat Pharma. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=666.0s)]
*  No, I've been trying this a long, long time, Debbie. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=667.88s)]
*  I've been trying to do it. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=672.1999999999999s)]
*  Finally. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=673.4799999999999s)]
*  Big Pharma lost and Americans won. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=675.68s)]
*  Thanks again to the Democrats in the Congress. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=679.5600000000001s)]
*  And, you know, I have a bad reputation of, Biden's not partisan enough. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=681.88s)]
*  Well, in this one, I'm partisan. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=686.08s)]
*  Because a lot of these guys came up to me and women said, you know, basically said, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=690.16s)]
*  not up to me. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=694.36s)]
*  They can't come up to me in the White House as much when I see them now saying, I know [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=695.5600000000001s)]
*  you're right, but it would cost me in my election. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=699.64s)]
*  I'd lose a primary if I supported you. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=701.84s)]
*  Well, look, starting in January, Big Pharma tries to raise the drug price faster than [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=705.0400000000001s)]
*  the cost of inflation. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=710.36s)]
*  They're going to have to write a check with a difference back to Medicare to cover the [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=712.36s)]
*  distance, the difference. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=717.36s)]
*  Lowering. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=719.64s)]
*  Instead of money going to the pockets of big companies buying back their own stock, which [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=721.64s)]
*  is the way in which, this is why they keep buying their own stock back. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=726.0s)]
*  That's how the executives get paid. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=730.24s)]
*  Eighty-nine percent of their salary. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=731.9200000000001s)]
*  I think that's the number. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=733.36s)]
*  Is paid on stock. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=735.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=736.48s)]
*  If you have 100 shares of stock and you buy back 50, the 50 left are worth more than 100 [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=738.0s)]
*  each one. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=743.08s)]
*  Same total amount. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=744.08s)]
*  And also, they're, in fact, putting them into the pockets of their shareholders. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=746.0400000000001s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with that per se. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=751.32s)]
*  Unless there's some time you're ripping people off to get there. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=754.0400000000001s)]
*  It'll go into you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=758.2s)]
*  This time it goes into your pockets for lower drug prices. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=758.96s)]
*  And look, the practical thing, at least in my household where I was raised, is that means [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=763.56s)]
*  you have more money for the car payments, more money for groceries that are high because [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=772.4s)]
*  of Putin cutting off grain supplies. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=776.1199999999999s)]
*  You have more money to put toward holiday shopping for your grandkids. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=780.4s)]
*  It's about basic standards of living for ordinary Americans. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=784.1199999999999s)]
*  What the drug companies are doing now is really inflating your cost of living. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=788.1999999999999s)]
*  And we're doing something about it. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=793.4s)]
*  We're going to give Medicare the power to negotiate lower prescription drug costs, period. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=795.6s)]
*  We fought for years to make this happen. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=800.52s)]
*  This year we got it done. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=803.92s)]
*  Medicare is going to finally have the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=804.92s)]
*  like the VA can do, the Veterans Administration. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=808.92s)]
*  We can, they can do that now. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=811.24s)]
*  And private insurance companies. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=813.84s)]
*  The VA can say, look, you want to sell all our veterans that particular drug, we're not [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=814.84s)]
*  going to pay that much for it. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=819.92s)]
*  We're not going to pay $10. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=821.3199999999999s)]
*  We're only going to pay $7.50. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=822.7199999999999s)]
*  If you don't want it, we're not going to buy it. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=825.7199999999999s)]
*  You don't want to sell it to us. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=827.1999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's a gigantic customer. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=828.52s)]
*  Well, the biggest customer in the world for the drug companies is Medicare. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=830.56s)]
*  And so, whether the VA negotiated prices that are 54 percent lower on average than [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=836.04s)]
*  Medicare prescription drugs, the same if you're a senior veteran on a Medicare drug, on a [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=841.76s)]
*  drug that another person because your VA and other persons on that same drug who's a retired [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=847.32s)]
*  banker or a retired auto worker, guess what? [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=854.32s)]
*  The person in the VA and they deserve it, gets paid 54 percent less for the same exact [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=858.44s)]
*  medicine prescription. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=863.64s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=864.64s)]
*  But now Medicare is going to have the power to negotiate lower drug prices. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=867.52s)]
*  So, for example, when these guys come along and say, you know, we're going to charge [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=872.3199999999999s)]
*  you, I'm making this up. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=880.8s)]
*  We're going to charge you 10 cents per an aspirin. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=881.8s)]
*  And they say, no, we're only going to pay five. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=883.8s)]
*  Well, we're not going to sell it. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=886.68s)]
*  No problem. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=887.92s)]
*  They're going to lose 50 billion map aspirin or whatever the hell they sell. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=888.92s)]
*  The point is they're going to have to respond. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=893.12s)]
*  Seniors are going to see their out of pocket costs for prescriptions. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=896.1999999999999s)]
*  This is really important. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=898.56s)]
*  It was really important to my mom and my dad. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=900.56s)]

*  But but guess what? [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=908.16s)]
*  Now, the total amount of drug prices, prescription drug price, you have to pay in any one year. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=911.4399999999999s)]
*  If you're a senior on Medicare or Social Security will not be more than not be more than two [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=918.0799999999999s)]

*  You can't need to purchase. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=930.16s)]
*  You can purchase fifteen thousand dollars worth of drugs. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=932.4799999999999s)]
*  You only pay two thousand dollars, two thousand dollars for prescription drugs, period. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=935.12s)]
*  Whether it's expensive, expensive cancer drugs or any other drugs they need for the pharmacy. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=942.12s)]
*  My son, who died of stage four glioblastoma, the cost of those drugs was enormous, enormous. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=947.8399999999999s)]
*  We're talking about drug that can cost nine, ten, fourteen thousand dollars a year. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=956.12s)]
*  But thanks to this law, seniors are going to be limited to having to pay two thousand [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=961.56s)]
*  dollars for all the drugs they need. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=965.8399999999999s)]

*  How many of you know somebody with diabetes needs insulin? [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=978.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=981.8s)]
*  And when we when when when Debbie and I passed this law, it included everybody, not just [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=983.8s)]
*  seniors. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=990.4399999999999s)]
*  And so what happened was we said, OK, you know how much it costs to make that insulin [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=992.4399999999999s)]
*  drug for diabetes cost? [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=996.8399999999999s)]
*  It was invented by a man who did not patent it because he wanted it available for everyone. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=999.56s)]
*  I spoke to him. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1003.7199999999999s)]
*  OK. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1004.8399999999999s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1006.1999999999999s)]
*  It costs ten bucks to make ten bucks to make. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1007.88s)]
*  And if you count packaging and everything, you can maybe get it up to fifteen dollars. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1011.8s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  They're not going to have to pay more than thirty five dollars a month. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1018.1999999999999s)]
*  They still make a significant profit instead of an average of four hundred dollars a month. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1023.56s)]
*  Look, that's something. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1030.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, it's important. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1033.24s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1034.76s)]
*  It affected. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1035.48s)]
*  I was at an event like this in Virginia about four months ago talking about this. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1036.04s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1041.72s)]
*  And a woman stood up and she said, I have two children. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1043.1599999999999s)]

*  So we have to share it. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1051.08s)]
*  We have to cut it back. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1052.28s)]
*  We split in half. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1053.24s)]
*  Imagine a parent looking to their child, knowing they don't have the money or the insurance [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1055.56s)]
*  to be able to pay for it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1060.44s)]
*  Talk about being deprived of your dignity. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1062.28s)]
*  Look at your child. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1064.76s)]
*  You could have permanent damage or die without access. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1067.64s)]
*  Maybe so anyway. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1075.48s)]
*  And by the way, we're making hearing aids more affordable, available over the counter. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1078.12s)]
*  So people don't have to pay expensive visits to specialists. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1085.96s)]
*  Folks who need them. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1089.16s)]

*  Two million people have been paying $200 for those shots up to now. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1108.1999999999998s)]
*  On average, folks, on average, they're paying $200 for $100, as much as two some places, [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1113.8799999999999s)]
*  I should say. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1121.96s)]
*  And guess what? [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1122.92s)]
*  You have to wonder how many seniors skipped the shot because they couldn't afford it. [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1124.6000000000001s)]

*  health care. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1172.1200000000001s)]

*  That's real money. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1199.56s)]
*  Seniors in Medicare, that adds up somewhere between $5,000 and $10,000 a year. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1201.24s)]
*  Some breathing room, as my dad would say. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1205.4s)]
*  The end of the month, end of the year. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1209.96s)]

*  And every single solitary Republican in Congress voted against these savings. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1231.0s)]
*  Every single one, including Senator Rubio, who now acts like he doesn't. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1236.04s)]
*  No, but I really was disappointed. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1242.2s)]
*  It really disappointed me. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1246.28s)]

*  The Republican Congress are telling us that their number one priority if they gain control of the [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1250.52s)]

*  terms of their energy bills because they're going to do away with the whole issue with [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1272.6000000000001s)]
*  regard to weatherization. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1277.24s)]
*  But let's be crystal clear what it means. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1278.92s)]
*  If Republicans in the Congress have their way, the power we just gave Medicare to [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1281.0s)]
*  negotiate prescription drug prices goes away, gone. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1284.6s)]
*  $2,000 cap on prescription drugs, gone. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1288.12s)]
*  $35 a month cap on Medicare for insulin from Medicare, gone. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1291.08s)]
*  Savings on health care premiums, $800 a year for millions of Americans in the Affordable Care Act, gone. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1297.24s)]
*  And of course, they're still determined to do away with the entire Affordable Care Act. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1303.1599999999999s)]
*  That means an end to protection for tens of millions of people who can't get insurance [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1307.0s)]
*  because they have a pre-existing condition. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1311.8s)]
*  Only means to do that is through the Affordable Care Act. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1315.1599999999999s)]
*  If the Republicans get their way, that's going to be gone as well. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1318.12s)]
*  And folks, it gets even worse. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1320.6799999999998s)]
*  They're coming after Social Security and Medicare in a big way. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1324.04s)]
*  Folks here in Florida, you need to know this. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1327.56s)]
*  And I mean this sincerely. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1329.3999999999999s)]
*  You need to know this. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1330.6799999999998s)]
*  You need to know why. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1331.56s)]
*  Because of your own senator, Senator Rick Scott. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1334.12s)]
*  I have a brochure here he has. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1337.8799999999999s)]
*  He is — he isn't — he's in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1340.6s)]
*  He's the head of the campaign. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1344.44s)]
*  And he laid out a clear plan. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1346.68s)]
*  He said every five years, Social Security and Medicare would have to be reauthorized. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1348.28s)]
*  And this is from the report I made at Larger. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1354.2s)]
*  Listed all they want to do. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1359.56s)]
*  Quote, all federal legislation sunsets — these go out of — goes out of existence in five years. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1361.96s)]
*  If the law is worth keeping, Congress will pass it again. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1370.68s)]
*  So every five years, the Congress will have to vote to reauthorize Social Security. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1374.8400000000001s)]
*  Reauthorize it, or else it goes away. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1382.1200000000001s)]
*  We'll have to vote to reauthorize Medicare. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1384.52s)]

*  And I go down the list, but guess what? [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1391.4s)]
*  The very idea that a senator from Florida wants to cut Social Security and Medicare — [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1394.28s)]
*  and by the way, they don't have to just — it doesn't have to go away. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1398.8400000000001s)]
*  They can cut it. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1400.8400000000001s)]
*  They can change it, basically. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1402.04s)]
*  A senator from Florida going after Medicare and Social Security? [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1405.3200000000002s)]
*  I tell you what, I don't know where, as they say in Southern, [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1410.76s)]
*  doesn't know where you all been. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1412.76s)]

*  If the law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1431.0s)]
*  In other words, it goes out of existence if Congress doesn't vote to keep it. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1436.04s)]
*  Isn't that wonderful? [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1441.32s)]
*  And then along came Senator Johnson from Wisconsin. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1443.3999999999999s)]
*  He says five years is too long to wait. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1449.32s)]
*  No, it's hard to believe. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1452.04s)]
*  No, I really mean it. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1453.6399999999999s)]
*  It's hard to believe. [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1455.24s)]
*  He says it takes — that's too long. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1457.3999999999999s)]
*  Every year, every single year, it should be on the chopping block, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1460.1999999999998s)]

*  Congress doesn't vote affirmatively. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1468.6799999999998s)]
*  To keep it, it goes away. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1470.12s)]
*  Gone. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1471.2399999999998s)]

*  Imagine a child care worker in her mid-60s. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1489.08s)]

*  She's paid into Medicare and Social Security. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1494.2s)]
*  Every paycheck could easily get cut — or it's gone. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1496.04s)]
*  She's getting ready to retire, trying to make plans for the future. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1498.04s)]
*  She thought she could count on Medicare and Social Security to help her through that. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1501.48s)]
*  But with these guys, she doesn't know anymore. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1505.56s)]
*  And if Republicans in Congress vote to take away [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1508.2s)]
*  another Medicare benefit in a few years, what's that do to her planning? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1511.72s)]
*  They're going to increase retirement age for Social Security. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1516.2s)]
*  And shrink benefits. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1519.64s)]
*  That's what they're moving to do. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1521.56s)]
*  Well, imagine the widow here in Florida, and all she has left is Social Security. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1523.96s)]
*  What's she going to do if it goes away? [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1529.48s)]
*  If she didn't have Social Security, the poverty rate of people over 65 [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1532.04s)]
*  years of age would be four times what it is now. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1536.68s)]
*  Imagine a senior who takes a couple of expensive medications for arthritis [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1539.88s)]
*  and high blood pressure. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1543.96s)]
*  He's one of more than a million people with Medicare [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1545.88s)]

*  Now, finally, there's relief for the $2,000 cap. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1557.24s)]
*  But if Republicans have their way, instead of looking forward to having extra money [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1560.6000000000001s)]
*  in their pocket, it's not going to happen. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1564.44s)]

*  What do Republicans want to do with the money? [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1588.92s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1591.8000000000002s)]
*  They talk about they want to cut taxes for the wealthy and the corporations. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1592.8400000000001s)]
*  In 2020, 55 of the corporate 500 companies, the largest companies in the world — in [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1598.2s)]
*  the United States of America — made $40 billion, paid zero in income tax. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1605.64s)]
*  So I passed the law saying they got to pay a minimum of 15 percent. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1613.4s)]
*  Fifteen percent? [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1616.68s)]
*  You all pay more than that. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1617.4s)]
*  Fifteen percent. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1620.44s)]
*  Well, they want to repeal it. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1622.92s)]
*  It would allow some of the largest, most profitable companies in America to go back to paying zero. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1625.88s)]
*  And they want to extend the $2 trillion tax cut, which overwhelmingly benefited the very [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1629.64s)]
*  wealthy and the biggest corporations in the last administration, not a penny of which [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1635.96s)]
*  was paid for in the Trump administration. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1639.5600000000002s)]
*  What's become of us? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1642.6000000000001s)]
*  Folks, many of us are focused on inflation right now. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1644.92s)]
*  But let me say something. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1648.52s)]
*  I want to point something out. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1649.48s)]
*  They talk about big spending Democrats. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1650.28s)]
*  You know, I spent a lot of money doing these things, but guess what? [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1652.68s)]
*  I cut the deficit in half. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1657.0800000000002s)]
*  In half. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1660.6000000000001s)]
*  The federal deficit. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1661.48s)]
*  This year alone, $1 trillion, $400 reduction — $400 billion reducing the debt. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1663.5600000000002s)]
*  And last year, $350 billion reducing debt. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1672.3600000000001s)]
*  Give me a break. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1677.16s)]
*  I'm so sick and — oh, I shouldn't get going. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1678.44s)]
*  Come on, man. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1682.2s)]
*  I mean, it's just amazing. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1685.3200000000002s)]
*  No, that's a fact. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1688.3600000000001s)]
*  As — as my granddaughter, she used to say, Google it. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1690.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, I'm serious. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1694.92s)]
*  We cut the federal deficit in half while doing all this. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1697.72s)]
*  And we did it by just growing the economy in many ways and also — also making sure [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1702.6000000000001s)]
*  people began to pay their first share. [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1707.5600000000002s)]
*  And by the way, the largest tax increase we had was people for companies who were paying [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1709.24s)]
*  zero to 15 percent. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1714.52s)]
*  School teachers pay a hell of a lot more than 15 percent. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1718.36s)]
*  So I don't know what the deal is here. [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1722.76s)]
*  Quickly, let's talk — and I'll end this — talk about inflation. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1725.64s)]
*  If you want to raise the cost of living in seniors, go ahead and give free reign to drug [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1728.44s)]
*  companies. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1733.4s)]
*  Look at what these drug companies have done. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1734.36s)]
*  Republicans in Congress are cheering them on. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1735.88s)]
*  Go ahead and redo — and go ahead and reduce Social Security and Medicare. [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1737.88s)]
*  Watch what happens to the cost of living and hard work in Floridians. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1743.0s)]
*  That's what I call inflation. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1746.3600000000001s)]
*  The end of the month, what you have left, you have no money, that's inflation. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1747.5600000000002s)]
*  What's — what are you — the things you need, are they going up? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1751.0s)]
*  And they are. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1755.5600000000002s)]
*  They are. [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1757.3200000000002s)]
*  And now they've come forward with a real ticking time bomb. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1758.5200000000002s)]
*  This one is outrageous. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1761.64s)]
*  I mean it. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1763.0800000000002s)]
*  And I've been there a long time. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1763.88s)]
*  Now the Republican leader is saying, [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1765.96s)]
*  if I don't cooperate in cutting Social Security between going back into session [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1769.8s)]
*  and the end of this term — and I don't — I don't support cutting Medicare and Social Security, [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1775.8s)]
*  they're going to shut down the government by not providing the votes to pay our federal debt to [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1783.72s)]
*  other countries in the world. [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1790.2s)]
*  Be the first time in all of American history [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1792.36s)]
*  that — they're not going to get it done. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1795.4s)]
*  But guess what? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1796.84s)]
*  Remember last time Republicans tried this? [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1798.28s)]
*  And I was literally, as Vice President, negotiating with the Republican leader until [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1801.16s)]
*  almost Christmas Eve day — I mean, New Year's Eve day — until close to midnight. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1806.92s)]
*  We finally got it resolved because they couldn't take the — they weren't going to continue. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1812.04s)]
*  They knew what would happen. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1817.64s)]
*  Remember what happened? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1819.0s)]
*  The entire credit of the federal government was degraded internationally. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1820.52s)]
*  Because we played that game. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1825.56s)]
*  It didn't even do it and degraded it. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pm-wIbPFm2k&t=1826.68s)]
