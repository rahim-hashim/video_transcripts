# 'UNCONSCIONABLE': Hamas atrocities bring 'shock' and 'disgust' to IDF soldiers
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY)
*  Absolutely horrific reports revealing the atrocities Israeli soldiers are [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=0.0s)]
*  uncovering as they respond to Hamas attack sites. Dozens of dead babies, some [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=5.48s)]
*  of them decapitated. Full cups of coffee on the table, blood on the ground. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=12.3s)]
*  Lior Prosers, a former lieutenant for the Israeli Defense Forces, and he joins me now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=17.98s)]
*  Let's be realistic, this entire ordeal that the Israeli people are going [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=22.48s)]
*  through is horrific and every story coming out of there makes your heart [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=27.02s)]
*  sink. But when it comes to 40 babies, I've struggled to come up with a rationale, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=31.66s)]
*  with a reasoning. The only question I can ask you is what kind of an animal [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=39.62s)]
*  can commit and act so grotesque? Yeah absolutely and I don't know if you and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=44.7s)]
*  the viewers know but essentially every Israeli in high school in their senior [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=53.620000000000005s)]
*  year goes on a trip to Eastern Europe to Poland to see the death camps, to see the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=58.1s)]
*  concentration camps, really sort of to try and physically get in the shoes of [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=65.46000000000001s)]
*  the people that went through that brutality in the Holocaust and World War [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=70.22s)]
*  II and I think that nothing can prepare people, the people on the ground, to what [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=74.98s)]
*  we're seeing sort of you know in the you know in the southern border, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=81.98s)]
*  communities mowed down, families butchered and murdered, as you said, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=85.58s)]
*  babies slaughtered. This is you know truly truly unconscionable and I think [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=90.5s)]
*  that sort of you know what you're seeing is a move from you know shock, awe, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=96.06s)]
*  disgust and grief now sort of to an amazing national unity that I've and I [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=101.34s)]
*  don't think anyone has seen before. There's literally every single person [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=110.78s)]
*  doing what they can to assist whether it's bloodlines, support, 150% of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=114.42s)]
*  reservists being joining up and volunteering. It really is an incredible [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=121.34s)]
*  sort of feeling of national unity sort of to try and you know with the power of [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=128.14s)]
*  you know everyone together to try and get sort of beyond if that's possible [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=132.62s)]
*  these insane acts. I can't imagine what this does to the psyche of a soldier. I [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=138.29999999999998s)]
*  think for some it has to just knock them out but at the same token it has to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=142.85999999999999s)]
*  inspire them to fight. As to the fight, you know the training that the IDF goes [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=148.1s)]
*  through, you've gone through that training yourself, walk us through what they are [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=152.66s)]
*  doing literally as we speak to prepare for the fight ahead. So first of all [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=156.89999999999998s)]
*  there's what I call the receipt of the phone call. There's the automated phone [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=161.78s)]
*  call that comes in and essentially calls you up and what's called an edict 8 which [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=167.1s)]
*  essentially brings you in immediately and you go and you grab your gear and [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=171.46s)]
*  you meet all your team and friends and then you head down either to the south [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=176.34s)]
*  or a lot of teams are also going up to the north to prepare and then essentially [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=181.06s)]
*  you have a very tense few days where on the one hand you're preparing tactically [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=185.82s)]
*  studying the maps, understanding where your team and your platoon need to be [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=191.18s)]
*  positioned, the navigation routes and on the other hand sort of a very tense [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=195.32s)]
*  feeling because in the fog of war the the soldiers have no idea when you're [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=199.36s)]
*  going to go in so it's really trying to be as prepared as possible. I'd have to [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=205.64s)]
*  tell you to your point this is yes it's tense but it's also a privilege the fact [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=210.12s)]
*  that Israel does have the ability to defend itself that you know we you know [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=216.84s)]
*  we are not like we were 75 years ago and that's you know something that every [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=222.28s)]
*  every person every soldier feels before going in that it is a privilege to be in [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=227.60000000000002s)]
*  that position. In the 30 seconds we have remaining you are someone who [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=232.16000000000003s)]
*  participated in a ground invasion of Gaza. As briefly as you can explain what [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=235.44s)]
*  that entails for the soldiers because we've been told it's a lot of I don't [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=241.24s)]
*  say hand-to-hand but door-to-door close quarters urban warfare. Absolutely it's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=245.12s)]
*  the most difficult type of warfare you can imagine very dense urban warfare you [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=249.92s)]
*  need to as you said go house by house the amount of booby traps and tunnels [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=254.68s)]
*  that are used to surprise and try to abduct soldiers are everywhere and [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=261.28s)]
*  that's something that you have to prepare for you have to be very very sort of [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=268.48s)]
*  vigilant and diligent sort of in every action and this is what the the people [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=271.88s)]
*  the ground are focused on right now and and if possible I know it's a bit off topic but you know I do think that it is something that everyone at least in Israeli here in New York and everyone on the ground is feeling it is that feeling you know that you know a friend in need is a friend indeed and really sort of I feel like the outpour of support from across the US from all the different communities the leadership's sort of both sides of the aisle has been amazing and just so you know [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=275.8s)]
*  that it is really felt on the ground and everyone appreciates it incredibly [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5N9MMaBcJWY&t=305.76s)]
