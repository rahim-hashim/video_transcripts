# IDF spokesperson: We know what we're up against
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo)
*  Something to pay attention to on the ground for our viewers developments in the north if Hezbollah truly gets involved [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=0.0s)]
*  It will be a signal of how much Iran wants to escalate this conflict even more here to help us answer that question is [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=5.92s)]
*  IDF spokesperson lieutenant colonel Peter Lerner live from Israel Peter. Thanks for being here [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=13.76s)]
*  Let's start with that point because we're hearing reports of in increased conflict in the north. What's your what's your assessment right now? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=19.36s)]
*  As your troops are arrayed of the situation in Israel [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=27.44s)]
*  Yeah, it's an extremely extremely [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=32.0s)]
*  delicate situation as we speak and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=35.120000000000005s)]
*  Indeed the border with Lebanon is extremely volatile and we've had some exchanges there. I'm just getting some reports [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=38.32s)]
*  Of several mortar rounds that were actually fired from Lebanon towards the forces on the ground. So [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=45.24s)]
*  For I'll follow up during the the interview and try and get some more information for you [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=52.16s)]
*  Yeah, the situation is as such as we're conducting our strikes against Hamas their infrastructure their leaders [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=57.84s)]
*  Their terrorist infrastructure their base of operation that their fortified terror hub [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=64.16s)]
*  It's it's becoming extremely difficult in order to separate the two arenas [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=70.32000000000001s)]
*  We're doing that effort because we believe that we need to be focused on the main front Hamas changing [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=74.8s)]
*  the paradigm in the Gaza Strip so that Hamas can never ever [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=81.32s)]
*  Butcher our babies in their bedrooms [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=85.84s)]
*  And that is currently the situation as we move and look forward to towards the north indeed Hezbollah is a very substantial terrorist [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=87.84s)]
*  Organization that is holding the people of Lebanon on hostage [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=96.0s)]
*  They have some hundred and twenty hundred and thirty thousand missiles and rockets pointed in our direction. So it's a serious serious problem [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=99.44s)]
*  Lieutenant Colonel, what what is your level of expectation? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=108.84s)]
*  We talk about this spiraling into a regional conflict [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=112.16s)]
*  Do you have the hot spots as you said on your northern border with Lebanon? [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=115.52s)]
*  Obviously there are threats beyond that as well [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=119.36s)]
*  whether or not they come from Syria or all the way from Iran as you posture as the Israeli military is [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=121.24s)]
*  Posturing itself for what comes next. How seriously do you have to prepare for all of those threats? I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=128.04s)]
*  Would say 300,000 men and women seriously we recruited a huge amount of [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=135.08s)]
*  of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=141.48000000000002s)]
*  Reservists unprecedented in the history of Israel [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=143.52s)]
*  I think that goes to show how serious we are that we need all of this this manpower women power to fulfill our mission on [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=145.44s)]
*  on [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=153.52s)]
*  Defending the state of Israel. So many of those are now obviously focused down south towards this southern arena to towards Gaza [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=154.88s)]
*  Towards Gaza, but also many of them are defending the frontier with Lebanon and also with Syria with us this week over the past few days [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=161.67999999999998s)]
*  We've also had a few mortar rounds from the Syrian side of the border and into the Golan Heights [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  so yes, we are preparing ourselves for that reality we have the I [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=174.92s)]
*  Would say we have a vast spectrum of tools in our kit box and we are ready for [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=181.32s)]
*  To defend the state of Israel if needs be [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=186.79999999999998s)]
*  Tena corner, how do you balance the defense even the retribution for what happened? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=189.68s)]
*  in in those in those [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=195.08s)]
*  communities along the border the massacre that happened with the lives of the hostages because I presume that in [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=198.04000000000002s)]
*  preparing for this now ground invasion and some of the other [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=206.96s)]
*  Actions that have been taken militarily that that might actually endanger the lives further of the hostages [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=211.12s)]
*  So our operations now in the Gaza Strip are [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=219.32000000000002s)]
*  focused on two [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=222.56s)]
*  Maybe three main issues first of all targeting specifically targeting Hamas's capabilities. So we've taken out [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=224.96s)]
*  In the last 24 hours Ali Qadi who was one of the leaders who penetrated our border [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=232.84s)]
*  He's been killed in an airstrike by our forces. We are focusing on their special capabilities. They have drones with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=240.16000000000003s)]
*  Explosives that they used to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=248.64000000000001s)]
*  Attack our positions on last Saturday. And so we were able to take out those those capabilities [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=250.96s)]
*  We're we're targeting their command and control position and indeed when we look at what the enemy we are against [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=256.24s)]
*  The type of people were up against I want to share with you something that we found on the body of [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=262.76s)]
*  One of the terrorists that we felt that we killed in the exchange [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=268.04s)]
*  This is I don't know if you've you've seen it. There has been some video but it was [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=271.56s)]
*  This flag and I don't know if you recognize this flag. So when Israel is saying [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=276.24s)]
*  when Israel is saying this is [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=281.8s)]
*  Hamas is ISIS. This is what this guy was this terrorist this butcher was carrying in his pack [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=284.52s)]
*  So we know who we're up against and that's why when we are talking about balancing the needs we know we have to [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=291.0s)]
*  Take take this enemy. We need to defeat this enemy and we also need to balance out the differentiate the civilian population [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=297.92s)]
*  from the terrorist organization [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=306.2s)]
*  and so this morning and since yesterday morning actually we have instructed the people of the North areas of the Northern Gaza Strip where the [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=308.04s)]
*  core hub of Hamas is control and [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=316.08s)]
*  Controlling command systems where their leaders hide where they're hiding now [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=321.36s)]
*  We've instructed people to go beyond in order to [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=329.12s)]
*  Differentiate between the terrorists and the civilian population that are not involved. It's a serious serious challenge [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=332.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's very scary. I saw the pictures of those terrorists holding the baby and I can imagine if I was the mother I [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=339.08s)]
*  Don't care about anything except bringing my baby home [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=345.52s)]
*  So no doubt and Colonel real quick. We know you've warned the civilian population to leave. We know Hamas has told people to stay [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=348.28s)]
*  If a ground incursion were to happen, would you would the real Israeli army treat? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=356.35999999999996s)]
*  Anyone in that area who's on the street as a potential enemy combatant? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=362.2s)]
*  Is that the when you think of rules of engagement? How do you how do you deal with an enemy that also drops their uniforms and dresses? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=366.68s)]
*  Like civilians, how do you manage that? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=372.71999999999997s)]
*  Well, obviously that is the challenge of urban warfare and and fighting a counterinsurgency [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=376.35999999999996s)]
*  And the terrorist organization that hides itself beneath the houses [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=383.2s)]
*  In in the in the schools in the in the courtyards in the you know [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=387.64s)]
*  They have in hospitals in the medical facilities. This is the challenge and of course that is what they will try to do [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=392.52s)]
*  We have very good intelligence. We have a strong understanding, you know [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=398.32s)]
*  we've we've picked up some of the footage that they've [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=402.96s)]
*  distributed it in the aftermath of the attack or during the attack during the the massacre and [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=406.4s)]
*  We have been able to identify terrorists and target people that have already [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=412.4s)]
*  Participated in the attack and take them out because we we know how to get to them [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=418.24s)]
*  so I would say yeah, the the the current situation is one where [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=424.02s)]
*  We need to differentiate it is a huge challenge the people of Gaza themselves are not the enemy [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=429.84000000000003s)]
*  Hamas is the enemy and we need to destroy Hamas's capability to use the Gaza Strip [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=436.32s)]
*  as a [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=441.92s)]
*  Place to govern terrorism from and that is what we're up against [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=443.24s)]
*  Well Colonel Lerner, thank you so much for being with us this morning on Fox News [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pecKtF6KbHo&t=448.36s)]
