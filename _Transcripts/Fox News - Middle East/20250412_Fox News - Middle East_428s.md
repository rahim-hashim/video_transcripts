# NUCLEAR NEGOTIATIONS: Trump brings a ‘different set of rules’ to foreign policy
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A)
*  It's fight night for President Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=0.0s)]
*  He's heading to UFC 314 tonight while his administration battled with Iran today, holding [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=2.4s)]
*  nuclear deal talks with the number one state sponsor of terror that were, quote, very positive [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=8.94s)]
*  and constructive, with more negotiations set for next week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=14.48s)]
*  The meeting comes as the White House continues to trade blows with China over tariffs, while [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  the administration says phones are, quote, ringing off the hook as other countries look [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=23.12s)]
*  to make deals with the United States. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=27.560000000000002s)]
*  Lucas Tomlinson is live at the White House tonight with the latest. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=29.72s)]
*  Hi, Lucas. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=32.8s)]
*  Well, good evening, Elise. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=33.8s)]
*  President Trump on his way to the big fight. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=35.92s)]
*  Miami, if he leaves early, he can catch the last few innings of the Washington Nationals' [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=37.72s)]
*  Marlins game down there. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=41.44s)]
*  Now, here was President Trump aboard Air Force One talking about those tariffs on China. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=43.16s)]
*  We're making billions of dollars a day. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  We were losing billions of dollars a day. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=53.120000000000005s)]
*  This is in a period of two weeks. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=55.120000000000005s)]
*  We're making billions of dollars a day. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  China now is losing billions of dollars. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  I don't want them to lose money, but they're losing billions and we're making billions. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=61.519999999999996s)]
*  I flipped it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=65.52s)]
*  Now, White House officials say they've heard from dozens of countries trying to negotiate [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=67.52s)]
*  new trade deals. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=71.52s)]
*  Trump says he's close to some of them. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=72.52s)]
*  Some have offered concessions. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=74.52s)]
*  Two are firing back. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=76.52s)]
*  Then there's Mexico. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=77.52s)]
*  No retaliation planned. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=78.52s)]
*  Now, if you're in the market for a new smartphone, Elise, or a panel, you're in luck. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=79.52s)]
*  Late last night, the Trump administration said it would be exempting smartphones, tablets, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=83.92s)]
*  and other electronics, seen as a win for Apple. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=87.92s)]
*  It makes a lot of them. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=90.92s)]
*  Apple CEO Tim Cook personally donated a million dollars to Trump's inaugural committee back [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=91.92s)]
*  in January. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=96.52s)]
*  Now, fresh off talks with Vladimir Putin in Moscow, President Trump's special envoy Steve [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=97.52s)]
*  Witkoff just wrapped up talks with Iranian officials in Oman. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=101.92s)]
*  It's the first time in 10 years the U.S. and Iran have sat down for negotiations. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=104.92s)]
*  Iran's foreign minister called the talks constructive and promising. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=110.32000000000001s)]
*  We then saw similar language from Witkoff in a White House statement, which said, quote, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=113.32000000000001s)]
*  the discussions were positive and constructive. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=117.32000000000001s)]
*  So there you see there they both used the same word, constructive. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=120.32000000000001s)]
*  Now, Iranian officials say talks will resume next week, presumably in Europe. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=123.32000000000001s)]
*  And in case the negotiations break down, there is the military option. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=128.32s)]
*  There's a second aircraft carrier strike group now in the Middle East. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=131.32s)]
*  And those six B-2 stealth bombers continue to remain in Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=134.32s)]
*  OK, Lucas Tomlinson at the White House. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=139.72s)]
*  Really good to see you. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=141.72s)]
*  Happy Saturday. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=142.72s)]
*  OK, Joey, before we get started here, I do want to bring up something that the Iranian [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=143.72s)]
*  minister of foreign affairs said, saying, quote, both sides, including the Americans, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=149.72s)]
*  have said that their goal is also to reach an agreement in the shortest possible time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=154.72s)]
*  However, that will certainly not be an easy task. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=160.72s)]
*  I think that's quite the understatement there. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=164.72s)]
*  Yeah, I think Trump comes in and it's a different set of rules. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=168.12s)]
*  I think the biggest headline in all this is that Iran is really facing sitting down with [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=171.12s)]
*  the United States. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=177.12s)]
*  And that is a political win for President Trump, regardless of where their nuclear program [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=178.12s)]
*  is or isn't or where it's headed. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=182.12s)]
*  We can talk about the JCPOA and the other five countries that are still involved in [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=183.12s)]
*  that, the fact that the United States pulled out of it and in doing so with President Trump, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=188.12s)]
*  put much harsher sanctions on Iran. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=192.12s)]
*  Some of that kind of got lighter under President Biden and now it's back. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=195.52s)]
*  Iran knows that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=199.52s)]
*  Their economy isn't doing well. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=200.52s)]
*  They want a nuclear weapon, they say to these negotiations to defend themselves, but then [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=202.52s)]
*  they say to the region to destroy Israel. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=208.52s)]
*  And as long as that's their narrative, it isn't going to be allowed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=210.52s)]
*  And so their entire posture towards the Middle East and Israel would have to change for any [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=213.52s)]
*  type of deal to happen. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=217.52s)]
*  And I don't know if that's possible for a regime that controls their entire people by [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=218.52s)]
*  fear and keeps the friends they have with that type of rhetoric. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=222.92000000000002s)]
*  And so I think the idea that President Trump may end up using military force maybe through [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Israel as a proxy is probably just as real today or more real today than it's ever been. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=236.92000000000002s)]
*  And Lisa, you know, Iran in particular, they have this, Islamic Republic has this hate [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  slash fear over President Trump that really cannot be overstated. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=244.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think that's a very good example of how the nuclear program is advancing so quickly. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=251.32s)]
*  But this is a country also that the United States thwarted an assassination attempt against [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=254.32s)]
*  him. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=258.32s)]
*  And now they're at this negotiating table. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=259.32s)]
*  That's remarkable. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=262.32s)]
*  But you know, President Trump took out Qasem Soleimani. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=263.32s)]
*  He sent the message, right? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=267.32s)]
*  I mean, look, I think what is so funny is that we were told in 2016 that President Trump [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=269.32s)]
*  couldn't be trusted with the nuclear codes. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=274.32s)]
*  And he turned out and is one of the best foreign policy presidents we have ever had because [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=276.71999999999997s)]
*  he sees the world so clearly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=280.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, there's that statement, you show me your friends and I'll show you who you [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=282.71999999999997s)]
*  are. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  For whatever reason, the Biden administration and Obama have this weird relationship with [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=287.71999999999997s)]
*  Iran. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=291.71999999999997s)]
*  They might as well have sent a friendship bracelet to the Supreme Leader. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=292.71999999999997s)]
*  You know, they try to coddle Iran. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  Somehow that would normalize their behavior. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=296.71999999999997s)]
*  President Trump realizes when you're dealing with people like Iran, when you're dealing [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=298.71999999999997s)]
*  with countries and leaders like in Iran, you have to be tough. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=302.12s)]
*  They have to fear you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=305.12s)]
*  And you look at what he did during his first administration, the maximum pressure campaign, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=306.12s)]
*  those aggressive economic sanctions, also the diplomatic isolation, you know, trying [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=310.12s)]
*  to reduce those oil exports to zero. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=315.12s)]
*  You know, Iran's inflation hitting 40 percent because of some of the actions of the Trump [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=318.12s)]
*  administration and then also those Abraham Accords and bringing some of the Arab states [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=323.12s)]
*  in Israel together as well. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=328.12s)]
*  One of the best foreign policy presidents. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=330.52s)]
*  Iran's in a weaker position now than they were in 2015. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=331.52s)]
*  So I have faith that if a deal comes to this, it will be strong in our favor. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=334.52s)]
*  Well, and Gianno, the president actually supports the Iranian people. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=339.52s)]
*  Trump supports them. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=344.32s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=345.32s)]
*  And that's also notable. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=346.32s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=347.32s)]
*  And that's part of the reason why the leadership hates him. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=348.32s)]
*  I mean, his people want freedom and we got to keep in mind four years ago, Iran wasn't [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=350.12s)]
*  in this position. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=356.62s)]
*  They were weakened when President Trump left office. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=358.02s)]
*  Joe Biden created this global issue on the world stage by unfreezing their money. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=361.82s)]
*  That was a problem. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=368.21999999999997s)]
*  The fact that some of the weapons that we have sent over to Ukraine have been sold to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  Hezbollah and many of these other factions that Iran has used as proxies to attack us, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=376.41999999999996s)]
*  our ships, our soldiers with no consequences has created this environment on the world [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QslPWgHX50A&t=382.21999999999997s)]
