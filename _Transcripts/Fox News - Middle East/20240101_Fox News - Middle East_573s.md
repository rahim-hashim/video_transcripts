# The Fight To Fund Israel & Protecting The Red Sea | The Bret Baier Podcast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc)
*  We are deepening the war in the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=0.0s)]
*  We will continue to fight until the complete victory over Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  This is the only way to return our abductees, eliminate Hamas, and ensure that Gaza will [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=13.0s)]
*  no longer be a threat to Israel. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=18.04s)]
*  It will take time, but we are united, the fighters, the people and the government. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=20.44s)]
*  We are united and determined to fight to the end. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=25.36s)]
*  With the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu talking about the fight ahead, that may take [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=29.68s)]
*  some time. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=33.44s)]
*  It is our time for Common Ground. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=34.68s)]
*  It's a segment we bring Democrats and Republicans together. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=36.88s)]
*  Joining us tonight, Florida Democratic Congressman Jared Moskowitz and Ohio Republican Congressman [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=39.6s)]
*  Max Miller. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=45.879999999999995s)]
*  Thank you both for being here. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  I know you have a common ground on this issue, supporting Israel, and you've done a number [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=48.16s)]
*  of different things legislatively together. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=52.78s)]
*  Congressman Moskowitz, I guess in the wake of how long this is taking, how difficult [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=57.120000000000005s)]
*  the fighting is for Israel, do you think the Democratic Party has seen a significant split [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=62.56s)]
*  here in support for Israel? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=68.72s)]
*  And where do you think it's going? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=70.84s)]
*  Well thanks, Brad, thanks for having us. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=73.48s)]
*  So I mean, look, the reason why it's taking a while is because the world, the United States [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=74.76s)]
*  along with Israel, is saying be strategic. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=80.92s)]
*  Try to save as many civilians as possible, even while Hamas uses them as a human shield. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=84.26s)]
*  And so that's why it's taking a while, because even though the criticism that Israel is receiving [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=89.86s)]
*  is unfair and sometimes borderline anti-Semitic, they are being more strategic than any nation [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=94.62s)]
*  when they prosecute a war. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=100.38000000000001s)]
*  So that's why it's taking a while, not to mention that Hamas continues to move the hostages [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=102.64s)]
*  around. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=106.34s)]
*  And again, remind your viewers that if Hamas would just surrender, this war would be over. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=107.34s)]
*  You know, look, there is a split within the party, but I would like to point out that [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=113.34s)]
*  I think in Congress it's small. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=117.98s)]
*  You've seen dramatic bipartisan support for Israel and significant amount of Democrats, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=120.1s)]
*  right? [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=125.5s)]
*  There's 214 of us in Congress, and there's a dozen or so, some more join them from time [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=126.5s)]
*  to time. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=135.9s)]
*  But the overwhelming majority of Democrats, along with my colleagues across the aisle, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=136.9s)]
*  support Israel. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=143.18s)]
*  If you look at the bill, Israel's right to exist. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=144.18s)]
*  There was only one no vote in that in Congress. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=145.66s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=149.1s)]
*  Here is Congresswoman Madeline Dean, a Democrat from Pennsylvania, in her conversation with [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=150.86s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=155.5s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=156.5s)]
*  I said, Mr. Prime Minister, you recognize that as you showed us these videos, the world [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=157.5s)]
*  the other videos of Gaza and dead children is absolutely unacceptable. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=165.34s)]
*  The level of innocent loss of life is unacceptable. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=171.02s)]
*  And he tried to say to me, but there's a difference. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=174.5s)]
*  There's a difference. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=176.58s)]
*  I said, one difference is that it appears that Hamas took joy in the killing. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=177.70000000000002s)]
*  I certainly hope you take no joy in the killing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=183.26s)]
*  Congressman Miller, she's talking about the videos from October 7th, obviously. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=186.26s)]
*  And she is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=192.5s)]
*  And my colleague from across the aisle, Madeline Dean, I have a great amount of respect for [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=193.5s)]
*  her. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=196.34s)]
*  And I believe I've taken two co-dels with her overseas. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=197.34s)]
*  I respectfully disagree. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=200.02s)]
*  Israel needs to be given the latitude. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=201.86s)]
*  And look, no one wants to see innocent lives lost. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=203.26s)]
*  I don't want to see any guys in innocent lives lost or Israelis. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=205.98s)]
*  But at the end of the day, what Hamas did, they started this war. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=210.26s)]
*  They have ended the previous ceasefire, as my colleague Jared just said. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=213.98000000000002s)]
*  And then they just rejected another one that's being trying to coalesce around the Arab world, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=217.94s)]
*  that is a deal that wouldn't satiate me or I believe the American people keeping the [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=223.78s)]
*  Palestinian authority in charge. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=227.66s)]
*  But I respectfully disagree with her comments. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=229.78s)]
*  What Israel is doing right now, to be clear, I'm a United States Marine. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=232.1s)]
*  I have never seen warfare since Vietnam, and I wasn't even born, that has a tunnel system [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=235.7s)]
*  that goes hundreds of feet down. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=240.9s)]
*  And these tunnels, they're a spider web. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=243.46s)]
*  And now you have Gazan civilians who are in the streets fighting for humanitarian aid [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=245.62s)]
*  so that Hamas doesn't continue to use it to build the tunnels to kill Israeli civilians [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=250.46s)]
*  on an everyday basis. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=254.54s)]
*  The Gazan people want to be free. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=256.5s)]
*  But make no mistake, this ideology of Gazan civilians crossing over to commit these atrocities [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=258.44s)]
*  also has to be known to the American people. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=264.66s)]
*  It wasn't just Hamas who participated in these attacks. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=267.16s)]
*  It was thousands of Palestinian civilians. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=271.06s)]
*  And it could have been my neighbors here, where I live in my home, that just saw blood [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=274.06s)]
*  lust, picked up a weapon, and started taking Jewish people and other people as hostages [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=278.06s)]
*  and selling them off. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=284.3s)]
*  So I respectfully disagree, but I do respect her greatly. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=285.86s)]
*  In the meantime, Congressman Moskowitz, we're under attack ourselves. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=290.46s)]
*  The U.S. troops in the region are getting attacked. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=294.34000000000003s)]
*  In Iraq, we had troops wounded by Hezbollah attack in a specific place in the Erbil air [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=296.54s)]
*  base up in the north. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=303.94s)]
*  And that is about number 102 as far as attacks. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=306.21999999999997s)]
*  Just today, this morning, there was an effort by the USS Lamboun FAA teams from the Eisenhower [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=311.42s)]
*  Carrier Strike Group, shot down 12 one-way attack drones that were, and three anti-ship [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=319.86s)]
*  ballistic missiles, two land attack cruise missiles. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=327.76s)]
*  This is all coming from CENTCOM. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=330.54s)]
*  And happening today, these attacks are coming fast and furious. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=333.82s)]
*  Is the administration responding adequately to be able to send the message that this has [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=336.82s)]
*  to stop? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=342.82s)]
*  Well, look, I think the president, the administration, and the United States made the right decision [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=343.82s)]
*  when we sent the battle cruisers in, the aircraft carriers into the region, and the nuclear [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=350.64s)]
*  submarines to not only make sure that Israel knows we're supporting them and we're living [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=357.54s)]
*  up to that commitment, but that the world understands that we will use the full force of the United [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=361.98s)]
*  States military in the event that this war would widen beyond Hamas. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=366.9s)]
*  I think that worked. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=372.3s)]
*  I think the president did a good job keeping Iran. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=373.42s)]
*  This was Iran's moment. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=376.14s)]
*  This was Hezbollah's moment to really take advantage. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=377.38s)]
*  And I think the pressure from the United States stopped that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=380.0s)]
*  Now, with that being said, there are no doubt that some of the proxies are testing some [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=381.98s)]
*  of the limits here. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=386.78s)]
*  I do think the administration should balance. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=388.3s)]
*  I think they should respond forcefully, but make sure, obviously, they don't give opportunity [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=391.22s)]
*  for some to take advantage and widen the war. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=396.90000000000003s)]
*  So I would like to see the administration respond forcefully, but at the same time, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=398.58s)]
*  we want to make sure that we keep the balance here and that this war doesn't widen so that [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=402.86s)]
*  Israel can focus on Hamas. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=407.54s)]
*  And so far, that seems to be working. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=409.86s)]
*  We have many more months to go, Brett, I believe, in this war. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=412.82s)]
*  As Max talked about, the tunnel system, we have the hostages, and then obviously we have [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=417.42s)]
*  the folks, the leaders of Hamas that are still in the region that we have not found. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=421.7s)]
*  And so this is going to take a while. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=427.02000000000004s)]
*  And then obviously there's going to be time thereafter to figure out what happens with [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=428.46000000000004s)]
*  the remainder of Gaza and the West Bank and the Arab world, what will happen when Hamas' [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=433.02000000000004s)]
*  military capabilities are completely destroyed. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=437.22s)]
*  So I know you both share the common ground of trying to get funding for Israel at this [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=440.78000000000003s)]
*  time. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=445.14s)]
*  It's been tough in Congress to herd the cats around that supplemental bill that includes [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=446.38s)]
*  not only Israel, but border security and also Ukrainian funding. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=451.82s)]
*  Congressman Miller, do you think it's going to happen? [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  I sure hope it does, Brett. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=459.94s)]
*  I mean, through right now and from what we see just being in the House, I'm just going [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=460.94s)]
*  to go ahead and say it. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=465.58s)]
*  Mitch McConnell, Leader McConnell, and the two Democrats he has right now in the Senate [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=467.06s)]
*  is all of our negotiating power. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=471.42s)]
*  And as long as Leader McConnell can stand strong and get some HR2 provisions in, I believe [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=473.58000000000004s)]
*  the supplemental will hit the floor. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=478.54s)]
*  And I haven't been super quiet or cute about how I feel about the IRS cuts when it came [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=480.56s)]
*  to the Israel supplemental. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=485.3s)]
*  And I want to make something clear. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=486.90000000000003s)]
*  I still stand by those comments. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=487.90000000000003s)]
*  I thought it was reckless. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=489.62s)]
*  But we need to help our allies. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=491.08000000000004s)]
*  We also need to help ourselves. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=493.1s)]
*  We have 70,000 Americans dying of a fentanyl overdose every single year. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=494.76000000000005s)]
*  We have children who are being human trafficked. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=499.86s)]
*  And I can go on and on and on, as you have seen, and it's been on Fox all day, the crisis [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=501.90000000000003s)]
*  at the southern border. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=507.02000000000004s)]
*  So these are all things that we need to focus on. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=508.5s)]
*  It's my hope that the supplemental will be brought to the floor and that we see real [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=510.66s)]
*  leadership out of our party that can go ahead and get this done while helping the American [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=514.5s)]
*  people and the vital problem that we face and the national security issue that we face [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=518.74s)]
*  while letting in all of these individuals at our border. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=523.9s)]
*  I believe the American people know, and if you don't know, we don't stop every individual [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=526.8199999999999s)]
*  who comes through that border, who's an nefarious entity that may want to do something bad to [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=531.9s)]
*  Americans, as you see, Brett, and I'll end it right here. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=536.9799999999999s)]
*  When the clip you played beforehand, you saw a gentleman not only grab an Israeli flag, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=540.66s)]
*  he grabbed an American flag and he started stomping on it in the streets. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=546.02s)]
*  These people, what they want is they want total global domination. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=550.54s)]
*  But we have to help our allies because at the end of the day, we need our allies to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=554.08s)]
*  help us later on in the future. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=558.0s)]
*  Well, Congressman, we appreciate your time during this holiday week. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=560.6800000000001s)]
*  Thanks for coming on Common Ground. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=565.5600000000001s)]
*  Thank you, Brett. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4n0gHIXNhc&t=566.88s)]
