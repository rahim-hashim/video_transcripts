# Biden is 'coddling' and fueling 'barbaric' actions by Iran: Mike Pompeo
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE)
*  former secretary of state, Fox News contributor. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's give a warm welcome to Mike Pompeo with us. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=2.6s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, why would Joe Biden, as they now, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=5.2s)]
*  as Israel has now begun the ground operations, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=17.16s)]
*  why would he be calling for a temporary ceasefire? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=20.48s)]
*  Why would the president not stand with Israel and say, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=24.36s)]
*  go defeat your enemy and win the war? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=26.8s)]
*  Sean, there's no logical explanation. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=31.0s)]
*  If you put America first, you definitely want Prime Minister [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=33.4s)]
*  Netanyahu to do both his duty, that is to destroy Hamas, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=36.4s)]
*  and to complete that mission in its entirety. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=40.4s)]
*  And you don't need him having a second front here in America, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=42.6s)]
*  right? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=45.3s)]
*  You're fighting Hamas, and now you're fighting the Biden [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=45.6s)]
*  administration, fighting a Biden administration that has [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=48.0s)]
*  clearly just simply lost its way. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=50.400000000000006s)]
*  It forgets already now, just short of four weeks, what [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=52.3s)]
*  actually happened there, and is trying to sort of to restrain [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=55.400000000000006s)]
*  them and to hear Senator Durbin talk about a ceasefire in [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=59.400000000000006s)]
*  exchange for hostages. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=62.2s)]
*  Look, we want all these hostages home. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=63.400000000000006s)]
*  We want every American home. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=65.5s)]
*  We've had Americans killed, but make no mistake about it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=66.7s)]
*  If Netanyahu were to take that deal and get the hostages out [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=69.5s)]
*  in exchange for allowing Hamas to continue to threaten Israel, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=73.2s)]
*  it would only result in the death of more Israelis and more [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=76.2s)]
*  Americans. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=78.80000000000001s)]
*  And then lastly, Sean, you know, I heard President Biden speak [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=79.9s)]
*  today and I heard Secretary Blinken speak today. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=82.60000000000001s)]
*  Neither of them identified the real problem set here, which is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=85.0s)]
*  Iran. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=88.1s)]
*  They continue to coddle. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=88.6s)]
*  They've given them $70 billion. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=90.3s)]
*  It has fueled and set the context for the barbaric actions [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=91.89999999999999s)]
*  of which you spoke and Prime Minister Netanyahu has spoken. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=96.0s)]
*  To give Iran more money, more time, a ceasefire would only [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=98.8s)]
*  create enormous risk for Israel, for the Gulf Arab states that [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  are having rockets fired from Yemen, and for us here at home [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=106.3s)]
*  in America as well. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=109.1s)]
*  How bad can this get? [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=110.0s)]
*  We already see the possibility of a two-front war. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=111.6s)]
*  Hamas, Gaza, Hezbollah, Lebanon, the Houthis, the rebels in Yemen [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=115.9s)]
*  declaring war against Israel, Syria firing rockets into Israel. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=121.60000000000001s)]
*  Now, Erdogan and Turkey threatening to get militarily [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=127.10000000000001s)]
*  involved, and the mullahs in Iran, they're doing the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=130.70000000000002s)]
*  saber-rattling. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=133.6s)]
*  How bad can this get? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=134.8s)]
*  What is the worst-case scenario in your mind? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=136.0s)]
*  So there's enormous risk that this expands. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=140.6s)]
*  It expands in ways that cause the Arab states to have to [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=142.9s)]
*  check out because they don't feel like the United States has [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=146.0s)]
*  their back because President Biden called the crown [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=148.4s)]
*  prince of pariah. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=151.1s)]
*  The North Koreans have talked about providing weapons systems. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=152.5s)]
*  We know the Russians are already on the ground in Syria. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=155.4s)]
*  This could spread not only to the greater Middle East. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=158.3s)]
*  You could certainly have not only cyber attacks, but cells [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=162.3s)]
*  that are sitting in Europe, cells that may well be in the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=165.5s)]
*  United States. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=167.6s)]
*  We heard our FBI director talk about that just this past week. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=168.4s)]
*  Now, if the United States doesn't lead, if we don't [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=172.4s)]
*  reestablish the very deterrence that the Trump administration [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=174.5s)]
*  had in place for four years, on which nothing like we've seen [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=177.20000000000002s)]
*  in these three years has happened, right? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=181.3s)]
*  There was no war in Europe and there was no war in the Middle [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=182.5s)]
*  East for four years. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=184.3s)]
*  If we lose that deterrence, if America is viewed as weak, this [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=185.9s)]
*  could expand dramatically and we should all be reminded as [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=189.6s)]
*  well. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=192.8s)]
*  Xi Jinping is watching America's actions as well, and [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=193.4s)]
*  the Chinese Communist Party is sitting there just hoping that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=196.3s)]
*  America will demonstrate that it is impotent and decadent [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=199.1s)]
*  and unprepared to do the things that will protect its own [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=202.1s)]
*  citizens, not only abroad, but its own southern border. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=204.4s)]
*  I was speaking to a somewhat skeptical interviewer tonight, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=207.4s)]
*  and I brought up the issue that I believe when you and President [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=211.7s)]
*  Trump at the time put together a coalition, I didn't think I'd [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=217.0s)]
*  see this coalition in my lifetime, and that included the [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=220.0s)]
*  United States, Israel. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=223.6s)]
*  It included Egypt. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=225.7s)]
*  It included Jordan. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=226.9s)]
*  It included the Saudis. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=228.0s)]
*  It included the Emirates. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=229.29999999999998s)]
*  It led to the Abraham Accords, but that was unprecedented, all [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=231.0s)]
*  standing against Iranian hegemony in that region, all [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=235.3s)]
*  standing against a nuclear-armed Iran. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  All of that seems to have fallen apart. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=242.70000000000002s)]
*  To what extent did your peace through strength policy, your [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=245.8s)]
*  policies and President Trump's policies, make a difference, and [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=250.8s)]
*  how do you think these world actors are reacting to both [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=255.0s)]
*  presidents? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=259.6s)]
*  You know, Sean, we were pretty clear. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=262.70000000000005s)]
*  We were going to put America first, and when we drew red lines, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=264.90000000000003s)]
*  we were going to enforce them. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=267.90000000000003s)]
*  When General Soleimani was threatening American soldiers in [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=269.5s)]
*  Iraq, we made sure he didn't kill any Americans. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=272.20000000000005s)]
*  When we saw bad actors in different places, we didn't send [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=275.3s)]
*  the 82nd Airborne. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=278.6s)]
*  We used America's power, and we isolated the bad guys. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=279.70000000000005s)]
*  Iran was never as isolated as it was during the four years of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=284.0s)]
*  the Trump administration, and that led exactly what you described. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=287.7s)]
*  It led the Israelis, the Saudis, the Emirates, the Bahrainis, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=290.7s)]
*  the Sudanese, the Moroccans, all of them. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=294.3s)]
*  It led them all to join together and say, America is going to be [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=296.0s)]
*  with us if we have a bad day, and it gave them the capacity to [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=298.59999999999997s)]
*  push back against the world's largest state sponsor of terror, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=301.9s)]
*  who is the Ayatollah. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=304.5s)]
*  You know, we're now just a couple days past the anniversary [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=306.3s)]
*  when that same regime held Americans in Tehran at our embassy, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=309.4s)]
*  and today the president spoke of prisoners. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=313.0s)]
*  These aren't prisoners. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=315.4s)]
*  These are hostages. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=316.09999999999997s)]
*  That are being held inside of the Gaza Strip, and the United [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=317.59999999999997s)]
*  States weakness has provided the context that when Shemaz felt [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=320.2s)]
*  like it could do this with absolute impunity, and now you have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=323.5s)]
*  the American president and Democrat leaders demanding that [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=326.9s)]
*  that very impunity be granted to them. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=329.7s)]
*  And I have no idea why the Obama-Biden administration and [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=331.7s)]
*  now the Biden administration wants to give billions of dollars [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=334.9s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=339.7s)]
*  It makes no sense, or allow them to sell their oil and become [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  an oil-rich nation when they're the number one state sponsor [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=344.8s)]
*  of terror. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=348.09999999999997s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, great to have you, sir. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=348.9s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=351.0s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZNr4InD9hE&t=351.4s)]
