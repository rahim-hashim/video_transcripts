# How Putin benefits from Iran, Hamas actions
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw)
*  I want to go to Jennifer Griffin at the Pentagon right now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=0.0s)]
*  There were additional attacks on U.S. soldiers. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=2.36s)]
*  In case you're keeping track, I believe this is around the 20th we've seen in just the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=4.58s)]
*  last couple of weeks. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=9.3s)]
*  Jennifer, what can you tell us? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=10.3s)]
*  Well, Neil, as the Middle East stands on the precipice of a massive ground invasion by [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=11.64s)]
*  the Israeli military into Gaza, that we're told could last months and could trigger a [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=16.66s)]
*  reaction from Hezbollah in the north and other Iranian proxies who will try to test the U.S. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=21.84s)]
*  military across the region, tying the U.S. back down in the Middle East, it's important [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=27.68s)]
*  to look at who benefits right now from the actions of Iran and Hamas. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=31.8s)]
*  It's not the Palestinians. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=36.4s)]
*  It's not even Tehran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=37.88s)]
*  It's someone who we are no longer talking about every hour on the news, Russian President [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=39.2s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=44.68s)]
*  It's no coincidence that top Hamas leaders, including its founder, made their way for meetings [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=46.28s)]
*  with Putin in Moscow yesterday. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=51.64s)]
*  Ukraine are experiencing heavy losses, so much so that Moscow has had to rely on Iranian [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=54.92s)]
*  drones for any success on the battlefield. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=60.28s)]
*  We were the first on the air last night to report that a pair of U.S. F-16s had finally [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=63.34s)]
*  responded to 10 days of attacks on U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria, bombing two Iranian proxy [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=68.54s)]
*  facilities in southeastern Syria near the town of Abu Kamal on the border with Iraq. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=75.34s)]
*  Iranian and IRGC, Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps, weapons depot and one an ammunition [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=82.04s)]
*  storage site. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  A senior U.S. defense official tells Fox there were no casualties at one of the sites. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=88.60000000000001s)]
*  They're still assessing bomb damage at the other. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=93.76s)]
*  The Pentagon went out of its way, they tell us, to make sure Iranian forces were not at [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=96.46000000000001s)]
*  the facilities they targeted. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=101.34s)]
*  This target was about as low on the escalation ladder as one can get, designed to send a [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=103.32000000000001s)]
*  message to Iran not to continue testing U.S. resolve by expanding the conflict. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=109.0s)]
*  It's not clear that they got the message. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=114.76s)]
*  Iranian proxies launched a drone at U.S. forces at Al Asad base in Iraq today, which was intercepted [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=117.28s)]
*  and caused no damage. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=124.24000000000001s)]
*  It was the 20th attack on U.S. bases since October 17th and the first since the U.S. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=125.8s)]
*  carried out that pair of airstrikes in Syria last night. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=131.52s)]
*  There are 900 U.S. troops in Syria tonight at small bases, Neil. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=134.8s)]
*  Part of the anti-ISIS mission preventing about 50,000 ISIS affiliated men, women and children [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=139.20000000000002s)]
*  currently being guarded at the Al Hul refugee camp in Syria from being released, giving [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=145.72s)]
*  ISIS a fresh start in the Middle East. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=151.20000000000002s)]
*  Those U.S. troops are in harm's way tonight, part of this Iran proxy war. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=153.72000000000003s)]
*  Neil? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=158.12s)]
*  And just to be clear, you can help me with this, Jennifer. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=159.12s)]
*  focused on Syria for the time being? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=162.12s)]
*  The U.S. airstrikes focused on Syria. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=165.4s)]
*  One of the reasons for that, I'm told, is that the U.S. does not want to destabilize [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=167.96s)]
*  the government in Iraq. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=172.76s)]
*  If the U.S. starts carrying out airstrikes in Iraq, that government could fall and then [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=174.84s)]
*  you could see a return to a Shia crescent, if you will, from Iran all the way to Lebanon. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=179.36s)]
*  And that's something the U.S. is very cognizant of, even though most of the attacks on U.S. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=186.94s)]
*  forces have been inside Iraq. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=192.78s)]
*  Neil? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=194.34s)]
*  Got it, Jennifer. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=195.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=196.34s)]
*  Great reporting, as always, my friend. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9jyua-MQLQw&t=197.34s)]
