# Iran could push Israel into an unexpected deal with an 'arab partner,' congresswoman says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU)
*  Tomorrow marks one year since Hamas launched its assault against Israel, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=0.0s)]
*  killing more than a thousand and taking hundreds more hostages. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=4.16s)]
*  Now one year later, the war shows no signs of slowing down, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=8.0s)]
*  with Israel fighting a two-front war against Hamas in the south and Hezbollah in the north. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=11.76s)]
*  Senate Armed Services Committee member and combat veteran Joni Ernst joins us now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=16.16s)]
*  Senator, thanks for being here. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=21.04s)]
*  So how do we do two things at once? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=22.48s)]
*  Yeah, thank you. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=24.16s)]
*  How do we support Israel in that country doing what it needs to do to defend its [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=24.96s)]
*  sovereign borders and its people, while also not drawing us into a larger conflict in the Middle East? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=31.200000000000003s)]
*  How do we do that? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=36.72s)]
*  Well, Pete, thank you so much. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=39.28s)]
*  And this is extremely important because I'm sitting here in Red Oak, Iowa. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=40.88s)]
*  It's a beautiful day in the middle of harvest, peace and serenity. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=44.96s)]
*  And yet Israel is, you know, half a world away being torn apart. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=49.36s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=54.64s)]
*  We can continue to support Israel. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=55.84s)]
*  They have the drive and desire to go after Hezbollah, to make sure that Hamas is decimated. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=58.8s)]
*  They want to push back on Iran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=66.0s)]
*  And I think, again, it's extremely important that we continue to provide them the means [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=68.48s)]
*  to push back against these nefarious entities that exist throughout the Middle East that are backed by Iran. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=73.36s)]
*  Stability is important. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=81.12s)]
*  We can also use soft power. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=83.12s)]
*  We know that during Trump's administration, the Abraham Accords provided that peace and [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=85.60000000000001s)]
*  stability in the Middle East. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=91.28s)]
*  We can return to that once again, but we have to have American leadership, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=93.04s)]
*  leadership that is willing to be involved to broker peace deals. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=98.72s)]
*  And that's exactly what President Trump did. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  He will do again as our next president. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=105.52000000000001s)]
*  Do you think possibly this specter of conflict with Iran, with Israel, could actually push them [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=108.64s)]
*  further out into the periphery and Israel closer to a peace deal with Saudi Arabia? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=114.4s)]
*  I mean, you never know how these things are ultimately going to play out. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=118.48s)]
*  Peace would be what we want. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=121.36s)]
*  Has Israel opened that door? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=123.36s)]
*  Excuse me, Iran, with their aggression, opened that door back up? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=124.64s)]
*  Yes, Pete. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  And this is something that Saudi Arabia and Israel have been working on for a number of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=131.36s)]
*  years, what we call the normalization between Saudi Arabia and Israel. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=137.44s)]
*  And I was just recently in the Middle East, my fourth trip since last October 7th, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=142.72s)]
*  and spoke directly to MBS. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=149.2s)]
*  And he did state that it wasn't a matter of if this deal happens, but when it happens. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=152.07999999999998s)]
*  Now, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, of course, wants to see peace. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=159.92s)]
*  They want to see a solution in Israel. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=163.52s)]
*  But they are determined to normalize those relations with Israel, because once they do [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=166.64s)]
*  that, there will be greater security in that region. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=173.2s)]
*  All of these Arab partners in the Middle East, those partners with Israel in the Abraham [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=177.6s)]
*  Accords, they all see Iran as the great threat to their prosperity. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=182.72s)]
*  So they all want to come together. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  The Kingdom wants to be involved in this as well. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=191.35999999999999s)]
*  And I think Iran has pushed them much, much closer to Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=194.16s)]
*  And we hope that they are successful in getting this deal done with the assistance [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=200.0s)]
*  of the United States of America. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=206.8s)]
*  If you're sitting in Israel's position, Senator, do you think now is the time, from [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=208.96s)]
*  their perspective, if you believe that an Iranian bomb is an existential threat to you, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=213.51999999999998s)]
*  that religious fanatics with a nuclear weapon would threaten the very existence of Israel, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=218.32s)]
*  if you were Israel right now, would you do more to preemptively strike nuclear capabilities, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=222.4s)]
*  or does that escalate in ways that they don't want? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=227.44s)]
*  If I were sitting in a position of power in Israel, yes, it is something that I most [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=231.92000000000002s)]
*  certainly would consider. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  I do think it's important that Israel maintain its right to existence. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=239.92000000000002s)]
*  I just promoted a resolution, introduced it in the United States Senate with the support [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=245.28s)]
*  of all of my Republican colleagues saying that Israel has the right to exist. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=251.36s)]
*  Iran is a threat to their right to exist. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=257.2s)]
*  The door has been thrown wide open by Iran with their backing of Hezbollah, Hamas, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=261.68s)]
*  the Islamic Palestinian jihad. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=268.16s)]
*  You see this, of course, with their direct attacks now, two direct attacks [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=271.76s)]
*  in this current administration, which has never ever happened before in Israel's short [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=276.88s)]
*  lifespan. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=284.88s)]
*  So we know that they need to be able to push back. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=285.92s)]
*  Iran has given them plenty of opportunity now to do that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=289.68s)]
*  So whether it's striking their oil fields or most certainly going after their nuclear [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=293.84s)]
*  infrastructure, I believe they have every right to do that. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=298.56s)]
*  And I do believe the United States should enable them however we can and what means [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=302.71999999999997s)]
*  we can so that Israel will forever remain a nation in safety and security. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=308.96s)]
*  Senator, real quick, I just want to bring it back home a little bit too, but with a [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=316.08s)]
*  connection to the region, we at the top of this hour show two tweets that Kamala Harris [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=319.12s)]
*  put out yesterday, one with 157 million for Lebanon and 100 for a highway in North Carolina. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=322.88s)]
*  How do you react to the frustration people have seeing all that money going overseas, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=331.12s)]
*  but not enough to our folks here at home? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  Oh, Pete, I hear it every day here in Iowa as well. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=336.96s)]
*  And I understand the need to secure our own nation. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=341.2s)]
*  And so I do support other nations when they want to step up, secure their nations. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=345.92s)]
*  But when we're sending so much humanitarian aid to other nations that we're not able to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=351.44s)]
*  provide for the humanitarian needs of our own citizens, this is a big issue. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=357.28s)]
*  Our taxpayers work very, very hard. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=364.08s)]
*  We need to take care of America first. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=367.11999999999995s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=370.0s)]
*  Senator Joni Ernst, thank you for your time. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=370.79999999999995s)]
*  Enjoy the harvest season. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=372.32s)]
*  Beautiful. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  Thanks, Pete, so much. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=373.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFp8AcHs3nU&t=387.28s)]
