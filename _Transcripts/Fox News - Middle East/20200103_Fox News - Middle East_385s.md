# State Department urges US citizens to leave Iraq immediately
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34)
*  Iran vowing harsh retaliation over the U.S. airstrike that killed its top military commander, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=0.0s)]
*  General Qassem Soleimani. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=5.4s)]
*  Here to talk about all of it is retired four-star General Jack Keene. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  He is the chairman of the Institute for the Study of War and a Fox News senior strategic [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=10.700000000000001s)]
*  analyst. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=14.58s)]
*  General, been looking forward to speaking to you this morning. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=15.58s)]
*  First, what do we need to know as we are all digesting this news this morning? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=18.32s)]
*  Well, this is Qassem Soleimani represents the execution arm for the Supreme Leader. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=23.48s)]
*  There is no boss over Qassem Soleimani except the Supreme Leader of Iran. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=29.52s)]
*  And all the malign and aggressive activity that has been taking place in the Middle East [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=35.44s)]
*  and worldwide terrorism is orchestrated by Qassem Soleimani. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=39.3s)]
*  He has more blood on his hands than any other individual that is alive today as far as I [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=44.36s)]
*  can tell. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=48.36s)]
*  So what we did here, we took legal preemptive defensive measures to disrupt an imminent [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=49.6s)]
*  attack again on U.S. troops. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=58.02s)]
*  And that is within the president's full authority to do and in my own judgment something we [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=60.7s)]
*  could have done many years before because this is a designated terrorist organization [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=65.54s)]
*  and he is a designated terrorist leader. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=70.02000000000001s)]
*  General, Mark Esper, the defense secretary, joined us on this program about this time [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=72.74000000000001s)]
*  yesterday morning. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=77.84s)]
*  Obviously that was before the attack took place. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=78.84s)]
*  I hear you talking about legal preemptive action. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=80.9s)]
*  He suggested the options that were on the table yesterday morning. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=84.22000000000001s)]
*  Here's some of that. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=88.58000000000001s)]
*  I'm not going to, I'm not going to telegraph what we're going to do but people know that [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=90.26s)]
*  we have vast capability to do any number of things. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=95.34s)]
*  We will act in response to actions by Iran or its proxies and we will act to preempt [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=98.82000000000001s)]
*  any attacks on our forces, our personnel by Iran or its proxies. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=104.82000000000001s)]
*  Obviously that noted a bit of a change from what we had heard after all the action at [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=109.3s)]
*  the embassy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=114.3s)]
*  The Pentagon this morning responding with this quote, this strike was aimed at deterring [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=115.38s)]
*  future Iranian attack plans. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=119.7s)]
*  The U.S. will continue to take all necessary action to protect our people and our interests [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=122.02s)]
*  wherever they are around the world. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=126.9s)]
*  That is a statement by the Department of Defense. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=128.82s)]
*  General, how do we do that now knowing that they are vowing retaliation? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=131.14s)]
*  Well first of all, I think this president has shown enormous restraint. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=136.5s)]
*  It after all, the Iranians have been escalating for 18 months in the Middle East. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=140.74s)]
*  It created a crisis so that pressure is put on the United States to stop the sanctions [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=144.82s)]
*  and they've been disrupting oil. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=149.86s)]
*  They attacked one of the largest oil fields in the world, the Persian Gulf, tankers, disruption, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=151.26000000000002s)]
*  etc. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=156.34s)]
*  They shot down a U.S. drone and we did not retaliate. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=157.34s)]
*  In fact, after the oil field was attacked, I thought we should have retaliated but the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=162.14000000000001s)]
*  president showed restraint and he put a red line out there, Sandra. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=165.82s)]
*  He said, look it, if you kill Americans, then I'm going to respond. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=169.7s)]
*  And when that took place, this president responded and they were about to do it again. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=174.62s)]
*  Soleimani flew in from Syria, met Mohandas, who's his operational commander inside of [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=181.26s)]
*  Iraq. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=185.9s)]
*  He's an Iraqi. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=186.9s)]
*  We were probably tracking Mohandas and he met Soleimani and we attacked. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=187.9s)]
*  I think the secretary of defense was very much aware of the intel that we had and he [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=191.54s)]
*  probably was very much aware during your interview, Sandra, that we were tracking Mohandas, who's [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=195.98s)]
*  Soleimani's operational commander. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=201.57999999999998s)]
*  Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was on earlier this morning responding to questions over [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=204.34s)]
*  why President Trump proceeded with this action when previous presidents, including Barack [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=208.38s)]
*  Obama, did not. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=213.22s)]
*  Here's Mike Pompeo. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=214.78s)]
*  We took a very different approach. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=218.1s)]
*  We didn't send pallets of cash to the Iranians. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=219.22s)]
*  We didn't pay for hostages. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=223.54s)]
*  We didn't create a deal which would have given them a clear pathway to a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=225.9s)]
*  We've taken a very different approach. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=229.86s)]
*  We believe it's the one that will ultimately lead to success and stability in the Middle [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=231.78s)]
*  East. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=235.5s)]
*  Does it lead to success and stability in the Middle East? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=236.5s)]
*  What happens next, General? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=239.26s)]
*  It's our best chance. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=241.02s)]
*  We don't know for sure but look at the appeasement policy for eight years under the Obama administration [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=243.06s)]
*  blew up in his face because they wanted Iran to come into the community of nations and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=249.17999999999998s)]
*  act responsibly and that's what the nuclear deal was all about. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=254.33999999999997s)]
*  What did we get? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=257.78s)]
*  We get an Iranian-led civil war in Syria, an Iranian-led civil war in Yemen, human catastrophe [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=259.02s)]
*  in both of those places, encroaching on the security of Israel and undermining the oil [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=264.3s)]
*  flow out of the Middle East. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=270.21999999999997s)]
*  This is what we got. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=271.64s)]
*  This president looked at all of that and said, no, we're not continuing down that path. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=273.3s)]
*  In concert with our allies, strategically, the policy decision was we're going to confront [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=278.06s)]
*  Iran. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=282.74s)]
*  Not with bullets. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=283.74s)]
*  We're going to do it economically and diplomatically. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=284.74s)]
*  That's what the president's policy is and that's what has frustrated this regime. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=287.26s)]
*  I believe this is the only path we can get to curbing their aggressive and malign behavior [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=291.98s)]
*  that's been going on for 40 years. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=297.06s)]
*  All other attempts have failed. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=299.34000000000003s)]
*  This is the best shot we've got to stop this aggression. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=301.22s)]
*  I only have about a minute left or so, General, but that was Lindsey Graham's point earlier [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=304.34s)]
*  on Fox News this morning. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=308.53999999999996s)]
*  He says that the president has to convince the Ayatollah the oil refineries are at risk. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=309.65999999999997s)]
*  I hear you saying that they have to continue to be squeezed economically. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=316.94s)]
*  How much further can we go? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=322.14s)]
*  What other tools do we have to do that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=323.82s)]
*  I don't know about all the companies and firms in Iran. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=326.97999999999996s)]
*  The State Department and the Treasury Department have got oversight of that. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=332.18s)]
*  I'm sure they're pulling out all the stops to squeeze them as much as we possibly can. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=335.02s)]
*  And certainly we've got Russia and China helping the Iranians and I don't think we're going [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=340.3s)]
*  to have much success there. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=345.06s)]
*  Keep up the maximum pressure campaign is what we do. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=346.82s)]
*  We should be doing. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=350.06s)]
*  And I applaud the president for the restraint that he's exercised to date and we've got [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=351.22s)]
*  to stay focused. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=356.02s)]
*  And by the way, Iran is a nation state has huge resources despite the economic sanctions. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=357.02s)]
*  They have a worldwide terrorist network and they can strike not only in the region but [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=363.26s)]
*  globally. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=367.9s)]
*  And we've got to look at them not through the prism of Al Qaeda or through ISIS, but [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=368.9s)]
*  as a nation state that sponsored terrorism and supports the malign aggressive behavior [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=372.74s)]
*  in the region. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=377.78s)]
*  We will check back in with you soon. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=378.9s)]
*  General Jack Keene, appreciate your time this morning on all of that. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=380.65999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=383.02s)]
*  Good talking to you, Sandra. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YNg6Z32g34&t=384.02s)]
