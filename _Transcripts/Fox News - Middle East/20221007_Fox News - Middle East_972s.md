# Biden delivers economic remarks at Volvo Group powertrain plant
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 07, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk)
*  as we navigate through this economic transition we're in. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=0.0s)]
*  For some time, I've been saying that what we need to do [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=3.96s)]
*  in this transition, we have to move from historically strong [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=8.08s)]
*  economic recovery to a more steady, stable recovery. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=11.24s)]
*  We need to bring inflation down without giving up [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=14.8s)]
*  all the historic economic progress that working class [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=17.0s)]
*  and middle class people have made. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=19.96s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're seeing. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=22.04s)]
*  Over the past four months, we've created [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=24.22s)]
*  an average of 350,000 jobs a month. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=28.16s)]
*  That's down from the 450,000 jobs a month prior [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=31.64s)]
*  to the prior four months, and down from the 600,000 jobs [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=34.64s)]
*  a month to the four months before that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=38.36s)]
*  The pace of job growth is cooling while still powering [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=42.519999999999996s)]
*  our recovery forward. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=45.04s)]
*  Wage growth for workers remains solid, down from historic [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=46.96s)]
*  high pace months ago, but still growing for workers [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=50.0s)]
*  who deserve a raise. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=53.04s)]
*  And this is the progress we need to see. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=54.84s)]
*  In the short term, a transition to a more stable growth [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=57.88s)]
*  that continues to deliver for workers and families [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=61.0s)]
*  while bringing inflation down. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=63.68000000000001s)]
*  In the long term, the economy built on a firmer foundation. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=65.84s)]
*  We still have a lot of work to do, but we're building [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=69.68s)]
*  a different economy than before. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=71.84s)]
*  A better one, a stronger one. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=74.56s)]
*  Not trickle-down economy. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=76.68s)]
*  That never helped my family very much in Claymont. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=78.36s)]
*  Trickle-down. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=81.0s)]
*  This is an economy built on building from the middle [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=82.56s)]
*  out and the bottom up, not from the top down. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=84.96000000000001s)]
*  And when that happens, everyone does well. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=88.48s)]
*  The poor have a ladder up, the middle class do well, [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=90.32000000000001s)]
*  and the wealthy do very well. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=92.44s)]
*  They're not hurt at all. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=93.84s)]
*  That's an economic vision I offered to America [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=96.16s)]
*  when I ran and I'm pushing on. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=98.44s)]
*  And that's what I want to talk about today [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=100.92s)]
*  and how we have our Republican colleagues [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=103.6s)]
*  have a very different view. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=106.48s)]
*  And I know many of you are probably Republicans, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=108.68s)]
*  but many of my Republican friends are basically arguing [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=110.92s)]
*  that good news for the economy is bad news, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=113.8s)]
*  is bad news for America. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=117.48s)]
*  As if they're rooting for fewer jobs and lower wages. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=119.92s)]
*  It's all part of this trickle-down mentality [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=123.92s)]
*  that says it doesn't matter what's happening [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=126.67999999999999s)]
*  on Main Street, what really matters [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=128.35999999999999s)]
*  is what's happening on Wall Street. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=129.72s)]
*  If Wall Street's doing well, everybody's doing well. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=131.88s)]
*  Well, I noticed that the last, the previous four years [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=134.88s)]
*  weren't doing that well, and Wall Street was doing well, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=137.04s)]
*  and then that took a tumble. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=139.92s)]
*  It's not my plan. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=142.8s)]
*  We can continue to grow our economy [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=144.36s)]
*  in a stable and sustainable way. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=146.56s)]
*  We can build on an economy that works for everyone. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=149.28s)]
*  Today, we're going to do something [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=152.24s)]
*  that our Republican colleagues in the Congress [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=153.84s)]
*  don't want, don't want us to do. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  They love to attack the Democrats. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  They say we, for what we've done. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=160.08s)]
*  But they really don't want to see what their plan is. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  I doubt any of you can tell me [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=167.8s)]
*  what the Republican re-election plan is this time out. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=169.84s)]
*  What's their platform if they take control of Congress? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=173.04000000000002s)]
*  Let's start with inflation. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=177.8s)]
*  Let me tell you how I think about it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=179.96s)]
*  I think about it the way my dad used to talk about it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=182.92000000000002s)]
*  My dad was a well-read guy. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=185.08s)]
*  His greatest regret, he never went to college, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=187.32000000000002s)]
*  had to leave Scranton because when coal died, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=189.84s)]
*  everything died with it, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=192.4s)]
*  and we moved down to Claremont, Delaware, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  a little steel town at the time. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=195.8s)]
*  And, but it's the way most people at home [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  deal with these things. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=201.48s)]
*  You talk about around the kitchen table. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=203.07999999999998s)]
*  Do we have enough money to cover all the bills for the month [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  and all the necessities that aren't regular bills? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=208.6s)]
*  And if we do that, do we have a little bit of breathing room, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=212.92s)]
*  my dad used to say? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=215.51999999999998s)]
*  Just a little bit of breathing room after that's done. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  We don't have to worry. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=219.88s)]
*  Well, that's what we're trying to do. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=221.72s)]
*  Give families a little bit of breathing room. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=223.72s)]
*  And that's what we've done. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=226.28s)]
*  We passed the Inflation Reduction Act, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=228.0s)]
*  which the name doesn't matter a lot to people, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=229.8s)]
*  but it's going to give Medicare, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=231.60000000000002s)]
*  which a lot of people have been fighting for, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=234.24s)]
*  the power to negotiate lower prescription drug prices. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=235.64000000000001s)]
*  We pay the highest drug prices [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=240.08s)]
*  of any developed nation in the world. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=241.64000000000001s)]
*  It's going to limit out-of-pocket costs [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=244.20000000000002s)]
*  for people on Medicare, no matter what their drug — [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=245.92000000000002s)]
*  as you know, some who have cancer, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=249.32000000000002s)]
*  their drug costs are $14,000, $15,000 a year. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=251.36s)]
*  Literally, the drugs they need. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=255.0s)]
*  Well, prescription drugs for seniors [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=257.59999999999997s)]
*  cannot exceed $2,000 a year, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=260.24s)]
*  even if it's $10,000, $20,000, $30,000 that they owe. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=263.0s)]
*  It can't exceed $2,000 a year. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=267.08s)]
*  It's going to cap the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=269.92s)]
*  to $35 a month instead of 30 times that. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=273.48s)]
*  How many of you know somebody who has type 2 diabetes [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=277.12s)]
*  and needs that insulin? Well, guess what? [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=279.84s)]
*  It costs a whole hell of a lot. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=282.24s)]
*  A lot of money. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=284.32s)]
*  It costs a lot of money for children. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=285.8s)]
*  I was in Virginia not long ago, and a woman stood up and said, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=287.20000000000005s)]
*  I have two kids with type 2 diabetes, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=290.48s)]
*  and we have to split the — we have to — [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=293.72s)]
*  we have to break up what we have. We don't have enough money [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=295.36s)]
*  because they didn't have the insurance, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=297.8s)]
*  they weren't covered. And guess what? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=299.0s)]
*  Well, how do you look at your child [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=302.56s)]
*  knowing that they have type 2 diabetes [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=304.88s)]
*  and there's nothing you can do about it? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=307.72s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=309.32000000000005s)]
*  This is the United States of America, for God's sake. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=311.44s)]
*  Well, I — the bill I produced — I introduced — [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  said we're going to reduce the cost of insulin. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=317.76000000000005s)]
*  And, by the way, it cost — to make that insulin, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=320.24s)]
*  it cost $10 to make it and to package it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=323.52000000000004s)]
*  Ten. T-E-N. Ten dollars. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=326.76000000000005s)]
*  And they're charging as high as $650, $700 a month for it. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=330.48s)]

*  and I was able to bring gasoline down well over $1.60, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=727.32s)]
*  but it's inching up because of what the Russians [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=731.0s)]
*  and the Saudis just did. I'm not finished with that yet. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=733.52s)]
*  The cost of your prescription drugs and healthcare [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=737.8000000000001s)]
*  energy, they're all — they'll all go up. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=739.76s)]
*  Your protection of preexisting conditions are taken away. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=742.88s)]
*  Your Social Security and Medicare are going to be in a chopping block. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=745.04s)]
*  But they don't want you to know that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=748.64s)]
*  They're not campaigning on it, but that's what they are saying. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=749.96s)]
*  That's the documents they're sending out. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=752.84s)]
*  Folks, when it comes to the next Congress, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=756.0s)]
*  this isn't a referendum. It's a choice. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=758.28s)]
*  It's a choice between two very different ways [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=761.84s)]
*  of looking at the — at the economy. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=764.84s)]
*  You get over 200 and some people in the Congress [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=768.16s)]
*  who still think the last election wasn't fair, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=770.76s)]
*  that they were stolen. I stole the election. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=774.6s)]
*  Even though every major Republican judge in the Supreme Court said, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=777.24s)]
*  no, no, there's no evidence of any of that. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=780.1999999999999s)]
*  None. But I stole the election. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=782.64s)]
*  Folks, you know, we talk about democracy, whether it's at risk. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=787.8s)]
*  Well, democracy is at risk in most places [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=792.76s)]
*  when the only definition of whether you win — [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=795.64s)]
*  you either have to win the election or it's been stolen. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=799.28s)]
*  When, in fact, you have — when you have — [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=803.04s)]
*  in fact, you're in a situation where, you know, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=806.3599999999999s)]
*  a group of people attack the Capitol like we've never seen, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=808.8s)]
*  smash down the doors, go after people, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=812.0s)]
*  have three cops end up dying, so on and so forth. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=814.8399999999999s)]
*  And they're referred to as patriots. Patriots? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=818.2399999999999s)]
*  That's democracy? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=822.56s)]
*  Well, look, there's different ways of looking at our country. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=825.84s)]
*  One is to view it from Park Avenue, [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=830.16s)]
*  which says it helps the very wealthy [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=832.08s)]
*  and maybe it'll trickle down to everyone else. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=834.16s)]
*  If Park Avenue is doing well, we're all doing well. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=836.4s)]
*  The other view is from Scranton, Pennsylvania, where I grew up, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=839.28s)]
*  or view it here in Hagerstown. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=842.32s)]
*  The belief that the backbone of America — [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=844.64s)]
*  the people who get up every single morning [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=846.44s)]
*  and go to work and break their necks and make a living — [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=848.64s)]
*  the working class and the middle class. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=851.48s)]
*  That's who built this country. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=853.48s)]
*  And by the way, the middle class built America [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=855.48s)]
*  and unions built the middle class. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=858.48s)]
*  For real. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=861.48s)]
*  And, folks, that's who our economy should work for. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=863.48s)]
*  Let me close with this. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=868.48s)]
*  The people who built America are the people [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=870.48s)]
*  who built America. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=872.48s)]
*  Folks, that's who our economy should work for. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=874.48s)]
*  Let me close with this. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=876.48s)]
*  The last few years, we've faced some of the most difficult challenges in our history. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=878.48s)]
*  We're making real progress, [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=883.48s)]
*  helping folks just a little bit more [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=885.48s)]
*  and giving them a little bit more breathing room. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=887.48s)]
*  We just have to keep going. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=889.48s)]
*  And I know we can. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=891.48s)]
*  For everything we've been through, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=893.48s)]
*  I've never been more optimistic about America's prospects in my entire career. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=895.48s)]
*  My word. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=900.48s)]
*  I've never been more optimistic. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=901.48s)]
*  Just remember who in hell we are. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=903.48s)]
*  We're the United States of America. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=905.48s)]
*  There's nothing — nothing we've ever set our mind to, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=908.48s)]
*  we've not been able to do. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=913.48s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=915.48s)]
*  And, folks, nothing is beyond our capacity if we work together. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=917.48s)]
*  And so that's my hope. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=923.48s)]
*  But after this election, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=925.48s)]
*  there'll be a little return to sanity. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=927.48s)]
*  We'll stop this bitterness that exists between the parties [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=931.48s)]
*  and have people working together. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=937.48s)]
*  Because I tell you what, [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=939.48s)]
*  we can own the 21st century. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=941.48s)]
*  Not a joke. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=944.48s)]
*  We can own. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=946.48s)]
*  There's not a single other nation in the world — [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=947.48s)]
*  not a single other nation in the world is well-positioned [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=949.48s)]
*  as the United States of America is. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=952.48s)]
*  It's because of you all. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=954.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=956.48s)]
*  May God bless you all. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=957.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=958.48s)]
*  May God bless you all. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=959.48s)]
*  May God protect our troops. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=960.48s)]
*  Thank you, folks. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=962.48s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrYjvP7_8Fk&t=963.48s)]
