# OVERNIGHT: US strikes back on Houthi sites in Yemen
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA)
*  U.S. forces striking about a dozen Houthi sites in Yemen overnight after the Iran-backed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=0.0s)]
*  terror group hit a second U.S. carrier ship in the Red Sea. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=5.08s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv with more. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=8.540000000000001s)]
*  Hi, Trey. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=11.0s)]
*  Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=12.0s)]
*  Overnight the United States conducted a fourth round of strikes against Iran-backed Houthi [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=14.08s)]
*  rebels in Yemen, more than a dozen. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=19.0s)]
*  Launching positions were hit with Tomahawk missiles, according to U.S. Central Command. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=21.84s)]
*  Now in a statement sent com commander Eric Corilla saying, quote, the actions by the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=26.64s)]
*  Iranian-backed Houthi terrorists continue to endanger international mariners and disrupt [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=31.12s)]
*  the commercial shipping lanes in the southern Red Sea and adjacent waterways. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=36.3s)]
*  We will continue to take actions to protect the lives of innocent mariners, and we will [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=40.44s)]
*  always protect our people. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=44.28s)]
*  The same sentiment was echoed yesterday by the Pentagon with press secretary Pat Ryder [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=46.16s)]
*  saying this. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=50.519999999999996s)]
*  We are going to continue to work with our partners in the region to prevent those attacks [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=52.52s)]
*  or deter those attacks in the future, and we're also going to continue to work very [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=58.040000000000006s)]
*  hard to prevent the Israel-Hamas conflict from escalating into a broader regional conflict. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=63.36s)]
*  The Iranians have responded to strikes against their proxy in Yemen, saying, quote, the security [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=71.26s)]
*  of the Red Sea is tied to the developments in Gaza, and everyone will suffer if Israel's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=76.22s)]
*  crimes in Gaza do not stop. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=81.32000000000001s)]
*  All of the resistance fronts will remain active. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=83.12s)]
*  Now the question today does remain whether or not the Islamic Republic will get more [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=85.88s)]
*  directly involved in this escalating regional conflict. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=90.12s)]
*  Todd Carley? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=93.64s)]
*  Trey Yanks live for us this morning in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=94.64s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=96.36s)]
*  Let's bring in retired military intel officer, Colonel Jonathan Sweet. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=97.36s)]
*  Colonel, you just heard defense press secretary Patrick Ryder there, but Jonathan, to use [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=101.28s)]
*  Whatever we are doing is not preventing or deterring a single thing. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=106.84s)]
*  It certainly has until now. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=113.8s)]
*  Iranian proxies continue to target U.S. forces and continue to disrupt shipping in the Red [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=116.68s)]
*  Sea, so the message clearly isn't getting to Iran, who continues to press buttons. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=121.36s)]
*  Aren't we just kicking the can down the road until we have to confront Iran in some meaningful [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=127.16s)]
*  way? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=133.2s)]
*  We certainly are. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=134.2s)]
*  I think the administration is taking the path of least resistance in going after this. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=135.56s)]
*  They certainly do not want to direct confrontation with Iran, but it's going to eventually evolve [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=142.4s)]
*  there because other allies in the region are going to take those next steps. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=147.0s)]
*  Israel's already told Biden, the president, in a report that Fox had that if you don't [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=151.36s)]
*  take care of the Houthi problem, he will. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=157.68s)]
*  And he's already taken care of the Hezbollah problem and Hamas problem, so it's just a [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=159.24s)]
*  matter of time before he reaches out and strikes IRGC again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=163.56s)]
*  And he has twice, on December 25th and the 29th, he's gone after IRGC officials in Damascus, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=166.52s)]
*  Syria. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=172.0s)]
*  I would say, Colonel, if you are in charge right now, what would you do tactically and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=173.0s)]
*  strategically to stop all this? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=178.16s)]
*  I think strategically the messaging has to be direct. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=182.04s)]
*  It has to be to the IRGC. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=185.16s)]
*  It has to be to the Ayatollah saying if you continue this type of activity, we will strike [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  IRGC targets. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=191.84s)]
*  And in the meantime, you have to cut off the funding. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=193.32s)]
*  You have to restrict their ability to fund these organizations. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=195.24s)]
*  And that's just going to be through sanctions and control under their revenues. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=199.6s)]
*  This is all part of a much larger foreign policy problem that President Biden has. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=204.04s)]
*  But President Biden put us in. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=209.72s)]
*  You say the president's struggling to keep his head above water on foreign policy. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=211.6s)]
*  And just this week, here's a look at some really damning headlines around the world. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=216.16s)]
*  The U.S. claims seizure of Iranian-bound weapons, Iranian weapons bound for Yemen's Houthis. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=220.2s)]
*  North Korea is offering Russia weapons. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=226.04s)]
*  Taiwan reports first major Chinese military activity after their election. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=228.32s)]
*  Jonathan, doesn't this all come back to Joe Biden's weakness on the foreign stage and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=234.83999999999997s)]
*  an appeasement strategy that really hasn't done any good and has only emboldened all [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=240.07999999999998s)]
*  of our enemies? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=245.35999999999999s)]
*  He has certainly created a permissive environment which has allowed this to occur. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=247.96s)]
*  And by simply deferring action, he's allowed it to escalate on its own with other countries. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=252.04s)]
*  And everything you just mentioned is just a foreign aspect. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=259.44s)]
*  It doesn't include the domestic issues that we have along the border. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=261.76s)]
*  So no, it's by ignoring it or by paying a little bit of attention to it and kicking [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=265.28s)]
*  the can down the road, it's all just come to this point right now. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=271.92s)]
*  And it is overwhelming. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=275.56s)]
*  And the administration right now, it has to tackle this. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=277.12s)]
*  And they don't have a national security strategy in place that addresses any of these issues. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=279.64s)]
*  Okay, I understand. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=283.96s)]
*  I heard what you said in your last answer when it came to how he should solve the Iran [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=284.96s)]
*  problem, taking all these problems as a whole. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=288.76s)]
*  To me, Jonathan, it looks like the train has left the station in a really negative way. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=291.88s)]
*  And I don't think Biden can do anything at this point globally to solve all these problems. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=296.28s)]
*  What about you? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=302.12s)]
*  Do you think it's too late for Joe Biden to do anything? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=303.12s)]
*  It's not too late because we have allies that we can leverage. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=306.88s)]
*  Okay, in Ukraine, we have allies, obviously, within NATO that we can leverage. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=309.92s)]
*  And it's a matter of getting them the right weapons for them to continue their fight for [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=314.68s)]
*  their independence. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=320.40000000000003s)]
*  And in the Middle East, we have partners there too, particularly obviously with Israel. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=321.40000000000003s)]
*  But Saudi Arabia too, we have numerous Sunni Arab partners in the area that can help us [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=327.44s)]
*  confront Iran. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=333.20000000000005s)]
*  And partners in Southeast Asia too, particularly Australia, Japan, and South Korea. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=335.20000000000005s)]
*  So it's a matter of leveraging partners and working with partners and then working with [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  Congress in order to get the funding through that allows us to take on this task. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=344.20000000000005s)]
*  Jonathan, I look at this and say, look, if I'm an undecided voter at this point and none [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=350.16s)]
*  of the other issues that are out there right now are tipping the balance for me one way [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=354.48s)]
*  or another, this is the issue where I want a new coach in there because we need a new [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=358.20000000000005s)]
*  strategy. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  And I think at this point, somebody who can get the job done and undo all this damage. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=362.84s)]
*  Jonathan Sweet, we appreciate your time. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=366.28s)]
*  Thank you, sir, as always. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4meKtGp0cA&t=368.08s)]
