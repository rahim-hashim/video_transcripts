# Mike Pompeo: This is what the Biden administration is getting wrong
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 21, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU)
*  Fox News alert Israel launching a targeted strike against Hezbollah in Beirut killing 14 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF confirmed the strike killed a top Hezbollah commander that the US says was behind the 1983 Beirut [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=6.78s)]
*  Barracks bombings that killed more than 200 Americans [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=13.76s)]
*  Here to react Fox News contributor and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Mr. Secretary. Thank you for being here [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  first off these [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=25.48s)]
*  You have the pager [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=27.68s)]
*  Attacks and you had the radios now you have this [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=29.48s)]
*  How much of do you think they were able to get surveillance or GPS? [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=32.32s)]
*  Locations from those pagers as well and now they're able to hone in on remaining Hezbollah commanders [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=36.04s)]
*  How what do you make of how this is all unfolding? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=40.54s)]
*  Pete good morning. It's great to be with you [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=44.52s)]
*  It's certainly a demonstration of really good intelligence work [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=46.56s)]
*  years and years of effort would have had to have gone into this to to identify these things that the apparently very [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=50.08s)]
*  Granular level than they have been able to identify them and what it's allowed them to do is impose real costs on Hezbollah [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=55.68s)]
*  It's senior leadership now the second major strike [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=62.14s)]
*  And then do this in a way that minimizes civilian casualties. This is excellence in operations [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=66.08s)]
*  Yeah [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=71.88s)]
*  And I'm guessing that the Israelis continue to know more and will be able to continue to put pressure on Hezbollah [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=72.26s)]
*  So they can protect their own nation [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=77.12s)]
*  How devastating has this been for Hezbollah? Are they still operational? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  Can you give us a sense of that and then also does it make a wider war more likely or less likely? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=84.56s)]
*  Have they reestablished some level of deterrence Israel? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=90.2s)]
*  Peter my guess is that Hezbollah is still pretty capable still has [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=95.2s)]
*  Hundreds and hundreds of precision-guided munitions that could attempt to be launched into Israel [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=99.12s)]
*  I know the Israelis have taken out many [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=103.48s)]
*  Rocket launch sites and will probably continue to go after them [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=105.56s)]
*  But but the threat remains because it's not just Hezbollah. It's not just Hamas [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=108.4s)]
*  It's not just the Houthis in the end [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=112.68s)]
*  It's the Iranians that will continue to underwrite and fund them and help them rebuild even in the face of Israeli excellence [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=114.4s)]
*  You know as for escalation, I was so disturbed yesterday the Secretary of Defense [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  After the Israelis took out a guy who killed hundreds who killed dozens and dozens of Americans in 1983 [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=125.84s)]
*  Yeah, our embassy in Beirut who we'd been looking for for decades and had a seven million dollar bounty on they took him out [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=132.16s)]
*  And our Secretary of Defense said hey slow down Israelis [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=138.28s)]
*  You're gonna escalate this war [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=142.18s)]
*  My thought would have been thank you Israel for taking down someone who'd taken American lives [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=144.46s)]
*  And for every family who lost a loved one in that bombing [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=150.58s)]
*  This was a just an act of justice and rightful vengeance [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=154.06s)]
*  And so I think this will actually de-escalate because Hezbollah now has to risk its entire organization and infrastructure [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=158.18s)]
*  If it continues that its efforts to support Iran in this conflict against Israel [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=164.46s)]
*  You know you mentioned the way America's put its thumb on the scale usually telling Israel to pull back [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=169.92s)]
*  Why is it that this administration? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=175.12s)]
*  Harris Biden seems so hell-bent on accelerating the war and say Ukraine in expanding it widening it giving more [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=177.68s)]
*  Capabilities to the Ukrainians to launch into Russia but time and time again [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=184.72s)]
*  Pulling Israel back and saying we need to de-escalate their existential fight against Hamas and Hezbollah. Why the difference? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=189.35999999999999s)]
*  You know frankly Pete they've kind of been the same storyline we've been very slow right we restricted Ukrainians to we did provide weapons [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=195.76000000000002s)]
*  But we've provided weapons to Israelis what this administration gets wrong [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=202.36s)]
*  I think in both cases is it doesn't understand that there is evil in the world and the only thing that they understand is power and brute force [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=206.20000000000002s)]
*  These guys think right you can sit down with Ayatollah. They've been negotiating with them for three and a half years [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=215.04000000000002s)]
*  Given the Iranians and billions of dollars and then you end up with what we saw now almost a year ago on October 7th [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=220.6s)]
*  Americans held hostage by the Iranians in Gaza dead Americans 1200 dead Israelis and the Red Sea now almost impassable [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  When you negotiate with evil when you think you can appease them into peace you create exactly the conflict [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=234.51999999999998s)]
*  We see in the world today and the risk of escalation because of American weakness Pete is enormous today [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=241.64s)]
*  The next three or four months while President Biden is nominally in charge are a really dangerous time period for our country [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=247.56s)]
*  Nominally in charge indeed when you were Secretary of State I'm pretty sure everybody knew who was in charge a very different story [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=253.56s)]
*  Mike Pompeo sir thank you for your time appreciate it. Thank you sir have a good morning. You got it you too [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=260.84000000000003s)]
*  Thank you for your time [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7cYqvVl34tU&t=277.4s)]
