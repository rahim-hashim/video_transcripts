# Iran reportedly triples enriched uranium output, nuclear watchdog warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w)
*  Alright, we have a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=0.0s)]
*  There are growing tensions for U.S. forces in the Middle East as the Navy uses anti-ship [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=1.72s)]
*  ballistic missiles to battle Iran-backed Houthis in the Red Sea. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=6.12s)]
*  More than 100 U.S. bases have been targeted by Iran since October, including a Christmas [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=10.8s)]
*  Day attack in Iraq that injured three of our service members. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=16.240000000000002s)]
*  There are roughly 2,500 U.S. service members in Iraq, despite both Presidents George W. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=20.92s)]
*  Bush and Obama each declaring an end to the war during their terms. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=26.479999999999997s)]
*  Our next guest, retired Air Force Brigadier General Rob Spalding, led the security coordination [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=30.84s)]
*  during the 2007 Iraq surge. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=36.379999999999995s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=39.239999999999995s)]
*  General, thank you for being here with us. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  I look at this, I look at what's happening. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=43.32s)]
*  We're talking 103 attacks. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=45.4s)]
*  I think we, in the intro there, talked about 100 bases being targeted. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=47.28s)]
*  This is in Iraq, Syria, and other places. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=50.16s)]
*  Are we at war? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=53.239999999999995s)]
*  Is the United States at war? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=54.24s)]
*  We're having to shoot down anti-ship missiles. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=56.2s)]
*  We've got three service members. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=58.92s)]
*  I think one is critically injured. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=59.92s)]
*  Seems to me like we're at war whether we want to be or not. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=61.68s)]
*  We really are, and I think that's the, you have to look at the service members that were [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=66.0s)]
*  recently injured by the attacks and realize that everybody that's in the region now, including [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=70.4s)]
*  whether on the ground or in the sea, are coming under fire. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=77.6s)]
*  And you have to do the things that are needed to protect the folks that are there. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=82.04s)]
*  And I think the problem is we're not going after the real issue here, which is Iran. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=87.56s)]
*  Iran's leaders have started this war, and unfortunately we haven't acknowledged it and [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=93.28s)]
*  haven't done anything about it to dissuade them. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  So we're going to see attacks continue. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=100.2s)]
*  General, we took all of our service members out of Afghanistan. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=102.16000000000001s)]
*  We did it in a very odd way, really a tragic way when you look at the lives lost. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=105.56s)]
*  But our president believed we didn't need service members, troops in Afghanistan. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=110.36s)]
*  Why do we need 2,500 service members in Iraq? [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=114.74s)]
*  What is the mission there? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=117.97999999999999s)]
*  Why is that necessary? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  Well, I guess what the Defense Department would say is they're needed to be there to [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=122.47999999999999s)]
*  prevent any continuing attacks coming out of that region. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=126.63999999999999s)]
*  Unfortunately though, but if we're not going to do the things that are needed to protect [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=130.79999999999998s)]
*  those service members, then we ought to bring them home. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=134.04s)]
*  Yeah, you say they're there to prevent attacks, but if they're the ones being attacked, they're [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=136.32s)]
*  really there to be attacked unless we show that there's some sort of recourse. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=140.04s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=144.6s)]
*  If Iran is the problem, if they're, you know, we have our second topic here, they're escalating [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=145.6s)]
*  what they're doing with their weapons-grade uranium. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=151.0s)]
*  To dumb this down a little bit, basically you have to take uranium and enrich the isotope [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=153.76s)]
*  235 to 90%. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  They're up to 60%. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=161.6s)]
*  I believe they were at like 20% before this nuclear deal was first, the JCPOA was first [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=162.6s)]
*  introduced. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=168.39999999999998s)]
*  They're up to 60%. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=169.76000000000002s)]
*  To get from 60 to 90, that's a short leap. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=170.76000000000002s)]
*  So that's what Iran, we know they're doing that. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=173.08s)]
*  They've also increased their rate from three kilograms to nine over the last just six months, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=175.52s)]
*  I guess. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=181.36s)]
*  And so they're creating uranium potentially to be used for a nuclear weapon. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=182.36s)]
*  That's the big problem. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=186.84s)]
*  That's the big scare. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=187.96s)]
*  But they're also backing groups that are attacking U.S. service members. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=189.66s)]
*  Take nuclear weapons off the table. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  They're trying to kill us right now. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=194.56s)]
*  What can we do? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=196.64000000000001s)]
*  As the American Department of Defense or our administration's state department, what can [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=197.88s)]
*  we do to stop this? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=201.83999999999997s)]
*  Well, if you remember back during the Reagan administration, the Libyans were being provocative [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=204.16s)]
*  in much the same way. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=212.44s)]
*  And essentially, Reagan sent aircraft into strike targets within Libya, and all of that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=214.67999999999998s)]
*  went away. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=221.04s)]
*  If you go back to during the Trump administration and the attack on General Soleimani, Iran [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=222.4s)]
*  quieted down pretty quickly. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=228.48000000000002s)]
*  So you have to show them that you are serious, and they have to feel threatened. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  I mean, the reigning leaders have to feel threatened. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=235.12s)]
*  I think the other thing we have to consider, if this uranium enrichment continues, we're [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  likely to see an attack from Israel, if not the United States. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=242.16s)]
*  Yeah, it leaves us wondering, we don't want to leave it here, but it leaves me wondering [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=245.8s)]
*  what is stopping us from taking a larger action in Iran if it's the trilateral relationship [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=248.68s)]
*  with Russia and China. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=253.84s)]
*  Well, I don't think they would want them to have nuclear weapons either. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=254.84s)]
*  So it leaves a lot of Americans puzzled, that's for sure. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=257.6s)]
*  Big Dear General, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WC-PwLuOQ3w&t=260.36s)]
