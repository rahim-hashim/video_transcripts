*  Yeah. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=94.46s)]
*  I mean, is it for Israel — [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=95.46s)]
*  Why wouldn't a deal get done? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=96.46s)]
*  A deal can get done. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=97.46s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=98.46s)]
*  We're dealing with very complicated people. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=99.46s)]

*  Mr. President. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=103.46s)]
*  Mr. President, what is the goal in Israel to strike on Iran? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=104.46s)]
*  We'll see what happens. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=109.46s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=110.46s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=111.46s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=112.46s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=113.46s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=114.46s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=115.46s)]
*  Mr. President. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=116.46s)]
*  Mr. President, I think President Trump has been very supportive of the hostage and ceasefire [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=118.17999999999999s)]
*  deal. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=119.46s)]
*  Who do you think deserves more credit? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=120.46s)]
*  I think President Trump added great force and powerful leadership to this effort. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=123.46s)]
*  I appreciate it. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=131.45999999999998s)]
*  He sent a very good emissary. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=132.45999999999998s)]
*  He's helped it along. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=135.45999999999998s)]
*  And, you know, I'll just tell you, I'm happy that they're here. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=137.45999999999998s)]
*  And I'm sure the President is happy that they're here. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=142.45999999999998s)]
*  And I would think that's about enough. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=144.45999999999998s)]
*  Mr. President, what about the Israeli press taking a press conference in Israel and not [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=146.46s)]
*  in Washington? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=153.46s)]
*  We would love to take a press conference in Israel. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=154.46s)]
*  We'd love to interview you, Prime Minister Netanyahu. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=155.46s)]
*  I have a few more questions. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=156.46s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu, do you support going forward with this deal and getting all the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=157.46s)]
*  hostages out? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=158.46s)]
*  I support getting all the hostages out and meeting all our war goals. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=159.46s)]
*  That includes destroying Hamas' military and nuclear weapons. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=162.46s)]
*  And making sure that Gaza never poses a threat to Israel again. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=164.46s)]
*  All three. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=167.46s)]
*  And those things go together? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=168.46s)]
*  Can you promise to the families that you do have the ability to get the hostages out? [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=169.46s)]
*  I think that I should talk to President Trump, okay? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=170.46s)]
*  I'll ask him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=171.46s)]

*  Okay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=192.46s)]
*  I'll ask, do you agree with Trump's vision of getting all the hostages back home, even [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=193.46s)]
*  if it means to end the war? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=197.46s)]
*  Well, I'm not sure that you'll articulate correctly what the President's vision is. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=199.46s)]
*  You can ask. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=205.46s)]
*  He can speak for himself. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=206.46s)]
*  He does that very, very well. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=207.46s)]
*  I have my own views, three goals. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=209.46s)]
*  Not one, not two, three goals, and I will meet all three goals. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=212.46s)]
*  I think the President can help enormously. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=217.46s)]
*  He brings fresh thinking. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=219.46s)]
*  First thing. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=220.46s)]
*  Any address to the parties that terrorists who murdered hundreds of people who listed [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=221.46s)]
*  their own or the part of the deal? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=224.46s)]
*  It's a horrible thing. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=227.46s)]
*  We can't forget it. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=229.46s)]
*  I'll never forget it, and you can't forget it. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=230.46s)]
*  And some people want to put it out of their memory, but we're not going to ever let that [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=233.46s)]
*  happen. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=237.46s)]
*  It was a horrible day, October 7th. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=238.46s)]
*  That was a horrible, that was a horrible period of time. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=241.46s)]
*  And a lot of people like to pretend it didn't happen. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=244.46s)]
*  It happened. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=247.46s)]
*  It's a big group of people that like to pretend it didn't happen, like the Holocaust didn't [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=248.46s)]
*  happen. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=253.46s)]
*  Same mindset. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=254.46s)]
*  And now we're going to get this thing wrapped up and we're going to get it done. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=255.46s)]
*  We're also dealing, I think, very successfully with Russia, Ukraine. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=260.46000000000004s)]
*  We're going to hopefully get that one done at some point in the not too distant future. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=263.46000000000004s)]
*  That's a complex problem also. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=268.46000000000004s)]
*  But we solve problems. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  We'll, you know, when I left, we had no problem. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=272.46000000000004s)]
*  There was no Ukraine and Russia fighting. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=274.46000000000004s)]
*  There was no October 7th. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=276.46s)]
*  There was nothing. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=278.46s)]
*  And some very poor leadership led to a lot of problems and a lot of death. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=279.46s)]
*  And it's a shame, but we'll put it out. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=284.46s)]
*  We'll put out the fires. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=286.46s)]
*  We have a lot of fires, but we'll put them out. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=287.46s)]
*  The Press. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=289.46s)]
*  Why do you still support a Palestinian state like the peace plan you presented in January [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=290.46s)]
*  2020? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=296.46s)]
*  Is this plan still on the table? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=297.46s)]
*  Well, a lot of plans change with time, and a lot of death has occurred since I left and [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=299.46s)]
*  now came back. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=305.46s)]
*  This death occurred not while I was here, but while somebody else was here. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=306.46s)]
*  It shouldn't have happened. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=310.46s)]
*  They shouldn't have allowed it to happen. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=312.46s)]
*  It would have never happened. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=313.46s)]
*  And that includes Russia. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=315.46s)]
*  Ukraine would have never happened. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=316.46s)]
*  Not even a little bit. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=318.46s)]
*  Not even a chance. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=319.46s)]
*  But now we are faced with a situation that's different, in some ways better and in some [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=321.46s)]
*  ways worse. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=325.46s)]
*  But we're faced with a very complex and difficult situation, but we'll solve the problem. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=327.46s)]
*  Mr. President, if you get your genes from Gaza out of Gaza, if not Jordan, Egypt, what [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=333.46s)]
*  other countries you think might accept Palestinians from Gaza? [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=340.46s)]
*  Well, I think Jordan and Egypt will — I know they've spoken about it with you and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=343.46s)]
*  they say they're not going to accept. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=348.46s)]
*  I say they will. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=349.46s)]
*  But I think other countries will accept also. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=350.46s)]
*  I think that Gaza maybe is a demolition site right now. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=353.46s)]
*  If you look at Gaza, it's all — I mean, it's hardly a building standing. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=357.46s)]
*  The ones that are going to collapse, you can't live in Gaza right now. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=361.46s)]
*  And I think we need another location. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=365.46s)]
*  I think it should be a location that's going to make people happy. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=367.46s)]
*  You look over the decades, it's all death in Gaza. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=370.46s)]
*  This has been happening for years. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=375.46s)]
*  It's all death. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=376.46s)]
*  If we can get a beautiful area to resettle people permanently in nice homes and where [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=378.46s)]
*  they can be happy and not be shot, not be killed, not be knifed to death like what's [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=383.46s)]
*  happening in Gaza. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=387.46s)]
*  And right now, you have, in Gaza, a very dangerous situation in terms of explosives [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=389.46s)]
*  all over the place, in terms of tunnels that nobody knows who's in the tunnel. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=393.46s)]
*  The whole thing is a mess. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=398.46s)]
*  And I think that if we can resettle — and I believe we can do it in areas where the [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=400.46s)]
*  leaders currently say no. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=406.46s)]
*  I mean, I've been saying that with Mexico having to do with the border and all of the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=407.46s)]
*  things. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=413.46s)]
*  And you saw what happened — 10,000 soldiers. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=414.46s)]
*  And they're going to do a good job. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=416.46s)]
*  I really believe that. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=418.46s)]
*  And I believe Canada is going to do a good job also. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=419.46s)]
*  And they said the same thing. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=421.46s)]
*  And then they did something much different than what you were hearing. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=422.46s)]
*  This is a very, very difficult situation, but we're going to get it solved. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=426.46s)]
*  I don't think people should be going back to Gaza. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=431.46s)]
*  I think that Gaza has been very unlucky for them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=433.46s)]
*  They've lived like hell. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=437.46s)]
*  They lived like you're living in hell. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=438.46s)]
*  Gaza is not a place for people to be living. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=440.46s)]
*  And the only reason they want to go back — and I believe this strongly — is because [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=443.46s)]
*  they have no alternative. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=446.46s)]
*  What's the alternative? [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=447.46s)]
*  Go where? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=448.46s)]
*  There's no other alternative. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=449.46s)]
*  If they had an alternative, they'd much rather not go back to Gaza and live in a beautiful [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=450.46s)]
*  alternative that's safe. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=456.46s)]
*  Mr. President, you don't have to see — [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=457.46s)]
*  Mr. President, you don't have to see — [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=458.46s)]
*  Peter? [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=459.46s)]
*  Would Palestinians have the right to return to Gaza if they left while the rebuilding [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=460.46s)]
*  was happening? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=461.46s)]
*  It would be my hope that we could do something really nice, really good, where they wouldn't [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=462.46s)]
*  want to go back to Gaza. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=467.46s)]
*  Why would they want to return? [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=468.46s)]
*  The place has been hell. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=479.46s)]
*  It's been one of the meanest, one of the meanest, toughest places on Earth. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=481.46s)]
*  And right now, it's — I've seen every picture from every angle. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=487.46s)]
*  Better than if I were there. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=492.46s)]
*  And nobody can live there. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=494.46s)]
*  You can't live there. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=495.46s)]
*  So if we can build — if we can build them through massive amounts of money supplied [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=497.46s)]
*  by other people, very rich nations — and they'll be — they're willing to supply [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=502.46s)]
*  it — if we can build something for them in one of the countries — and it could [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=507.53999999999996s)]
*  be Jordan, and it could be Egypt, it could be other countries — and you could build [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=511.94s)]
*  four or five or six areas. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=515.38s)]
*  It doesn't have to be one area. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=517.06s)]
*  But you take certain areas and you build really good quality housing, like a beautiful [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=519.22s)]
*  town, like someplace where they can live and not die. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=525.62s)]
*  Because Gaza is a guarantee that they're going to end up dying. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=530.0600000000001s)]
*  The same thing is going to happen again. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=532.7s)]
*  It's happened over and over again. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=534.74s)]
*  And it's going to happen again, as sure as you're standing there, Peter. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=536.74s)]
*  So I hope that we could do something where they wouldn't want to go back. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=541.02s)]
*  Who wouldn't want to go back? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=545.58s)]
*  They've experienced nothing but death and destruction. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=547.78s)]
*  What will you do if Biden tells you no? [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=550.78s)]
*  What will you do then? [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=553.78s)]
*  Well, I don't think they're going to tell me no. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=555.78s)]
*  I don't think they're going to tell me no. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=558.78s)]
*  I think they're going to tell Biden no, and I think they're going to tell other people [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=561.78s)]
*  no. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=566.78s)]
*  So you think it will happen at the end? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=567.78s)]
*  I think there's a good chance. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=568.78s)]
*  Yeah, I'd like to see it happen. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=569.78s)]
*  How many people are you thinking about? [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=570.78s)]
*  All of them. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=572.78s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about probably a million seven people — a million seven, maybe a [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=573.78s)]
*  million eight. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=577.78s)]
*  But I think all of them. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=578.78s)]
*  I think they'll be resettled in areas where they can live a beautiful life and not be [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=579.78s)]
*  worried about dying every day. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=583.78s)]
*  Mr. President, do you support — do you support — [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=585.78s)]
*  Mr. President, do you support building settlements — Jewish settlements back in Gaza in the [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=589.78s)]
*  next years? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=597.78s)]
*  Say it. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=598.78s)]
*  Building settlements, Jewish settlements back in Gaza in the next year. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=599.78s)]
*  Do you support this idea? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=602.78s)]
*  I don't see it happening. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=603.78s)]
*  It's too dangerous for people. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=604.78s)]
*  Nobody can go there. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=606.78s)]
*  It's too dangerous. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=607.78s)]
*  Nobody wants to be there. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=608.78s)]
*  Warriors don't want to be there. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=609.78s)]
*  Soldiers don't want to be there. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=610.78s)]
*  How can you have people go back? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=611.78s)]
*  You're saying, go back into Gaza now? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=612.78s)]
*  The same thing is going to happen. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=613.78s)]
*  It'll only be death. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=614.78s)]
*  The best way to do it is you go out and you get beautiful, open areas with the sunlight [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=615.78s)]
*  coming through and you build something nice. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=616.78s)]
*  No, that's not what I meant. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=617.78s)]
*  I meant buildings. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=618.78s)]
*  Israel is still means back in Gaza. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=619.78s)]
*  They are not going to want to go back to Gaza. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=620.78s)]
*  Mr. President, what is your message to the families of the hostages that look at this [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=621.78s)]
*  deal that we're talking about? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=622.78s)]
*  I mean, it's not a big deal. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=623.78s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=624.78s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=625.78s)]
*  It's a big deal. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=626.78s)]
*  We got over 70 percent, close to 75 percent of the people who everybody believed will [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=627.78s)]
*  not get out. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=651.9s)]
*  We got them in successive deals. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=652.9s)]
*  And most recently, with the help of President Trump, we're not going to give up on our [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=653.9s)]
*  other war ends. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=655.9s)]
*  Hamas is not going to be in Gaza, and we're going to get everyone back. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=656.9s)]
*  And you would not have... [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=657.9s)]
*  Prime Minister, how optimistic are you about reaching phase two of the ceasefire? [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=658.9s)]
*  How optimistic are you about that happening? [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=659.9s)]
*  Well, we're going to try. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=660.9s)]
*  That's one of the reasons, one of the things we're going to talk about here. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=661.9s)]
*  Is it possible that we reach phase two? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=662.9s)]
*  You know, when Israel and the United States work together, and President Trump and I, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=663.9s)]
*  we're going to try to reach phase two of the ceasefire. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=664.9s)]
*  We're going to try to reach phase two of the ceasefire. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=665.9s)]
*  We're going to try to reach phase two of the ceasefire. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=666.9s)]
*  We're going to try to reach phase two of the ceasefire. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=667.9s)]
*  We're going to try to reach phase two of the ceasefire. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=668.9s)]
*  We're going to try to reach phase two of the ceasefire. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=669.9s)]
*  How optimistic are you about that happening? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=671.9s)]
*  Well, we're going to try. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=672.9s)]
*  That's one of the reasons, one of the things we're going to talk about here. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=673.9s)]
*  Is it possible that we reach phase two of the ceasefire? [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=674.9s)]
*  And if we... [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=675.9s)]
*  Is it possible that we reach phase two of the ceasefire? [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=676.9s)]
*  You know, when Israel and the United States work together, and President Trump and I work [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=677.9s)]
*  together, you know, the chances go up a lot. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=682.9s)]
*  Is it possible that we reach phase two of the ceasefire? [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=685.9s)]
*  It's when we don't work together, Israel and the United States don't work together, that [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=688.9s)]
*  creates problems. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=693.9s)]
*  When the other side sees daylight between us, and occasionally in the last few years, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=694.9s)]
*  and they're not going to see it, that's not what it might be. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=699.9s)]
*  They saw daylight. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=700.9s)]
*  Then it's more difficult. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=701.9s)]
*  When we cooperate, chances are good. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=702.9s)]
*  Say it. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=703.9s)]
*  Now that Iran is so weak, isn't it the right time to win nuclear facilities once and for [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=704.9s)]
*  all? [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=711.9s)]
*  So you say Iran is so weak. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=712.9s)]
*  I appreciate you saying that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=713.9s)]
*  They're not weak. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=714.9s)]
*  They're very strong right now, and we're not going to allow them to have a nuclear [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=715.9s)]
*  weapon. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=716.9s)]
*  It's very simple. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=717.9s)]
*  You know, I signed a very strong proclamation. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=718.9s)]
*  Iran was, you know, very strong. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=719.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=720.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=721.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=722.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=723.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=724.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=725.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=726.9s)]
*  They're very strong. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=727.9s)]
*  Iran was in big trouble when I left. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=728.9s)]
*  They were broke. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=731.9s)]
*  They didn't have money for Hamas. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=732.9s)]
*  They didn't have any money for Hezbollah. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=733.9s)]
*  You had no problem. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=735.9s)]
*  October 7th could have never happened. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=737.9s)]
*  When I left, October 7th could have never happened. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=739.9s)]
*  And frankly, Russia and Ukraine, as I said, could never have happened. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=742.9s)]
*  They became very strong, very fast. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=746.9s)]
*  They sold massive amounts of oil to China and everybody else who would not buy the oil [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=748.9s)]
*  when I was president because we said, don't buy the oil. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=753.9s)]
*  And they became very rich very quickly. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=756.9s)]
*  But they're not weak. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=759.9s)]
*  They're not weak. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=760.9s)]
*  They're strong. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=761.9s)]
*  It doesn't mean they won't be weak. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=762.9s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=764.9s)]
*  We just don't want them to have a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=765.9s)]
*  They can't have a nuclear weapon. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=767.9s)]
*  The Prime Minister wants you to strike Iran. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=768.9s)]
*  That's what he wants. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=773.9s)]
*  You don't know what he wants. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=774.9s)]
*  What do you know about anything? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=776.9s)]
*  Is that option on the table? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=778.9s)]
*  President Trump, is that option on the table? [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=780.9s)]
*  You're not just talking about Jordan and Egypt? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=782.9s)]
*  No, it could be other places too. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=785.9s)]
*  There are many people that have reached out, many countries, many leaders of countries [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=787.9s)]
*  that have reached out that would like to participate in that. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=791.9s)]
*  It doesn't have to be Jordan and Egypt, but I think it would be also them. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=794.9s)]
*  Mr. President, your relationship with Mr. Netanyahu knew ups and downs. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=798.9s)]
*  How would you describe it? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=805.9s)]
*  No, I think it's mostly ups. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=806.9s)]
*  Mr. President, should we rule Pakistan? [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=808.9s)]
*  Because Gaza will be empty? [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=811.9s)]
*  What? [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=813.9s)]
*  The Palestinian Authority. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=814.9s)]
*  Can it rule Gaza? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=815.9s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=817.9s)]
*  Well, it's had a pretty hard time, wouldn't you say? [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=818.9s)]
*  I'd say it's had a pretty bad time of it. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=820.9s)]
*  Mr. President, Qatar has — you've criticized them in the past as a funder of terrorism, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=822.9s)]
*  so has the Prime Minister. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=827.9s)]
*  Do you think they're part of the solution or part of a problem moving forward? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=828.9s)]
*  I think they're trying to help. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=831.9s)]
*  Qatar is absolutely trying to help. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=832.9s)]
*  I know them very well, and they're doing everything they can. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=835.9s)]
*  Very tough situation, but they're absolutely trying to help. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=838.9s)]
*  Okay, thank you very much, everybody. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=841.9s)]
*  Thank you very much, everybody. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hDCroxd2ABY&t=843.9s)]
