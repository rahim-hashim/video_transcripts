# John Bolton warns Iran's 'ring of fire' plan playing out
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8)
*  Joining me now, Richard Goldberg, former director for countering Iranian weapons of mass destruction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=0.0s)]
*  at the NSC under President Trump and senior adviser at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=4.88s)]
*  Thank you very much for talking to us right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=11.44s)]
*  Let's talk about the war to the north. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=14.72s)]
*  Apparently, there is a ceasefire right now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=17.36s)]
*  Hezbollah has seized two fire rockets into northern Israel. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=19.68s)]
*  Is there some sort of diplomatic solution at all between Israel and Hezbollah, especially [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=23.72s)]
*  with Iran's dirty hands in the midst? [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=30.4s)]
*  Well, I think very important for all of us to understand, we've seen the horror show [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=33.0s)]
*  that has come out of Gaza because of Hamas, and you've seen the rockets pouring down from [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=37.96s)]
*  Gaza for years. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=42.36s)]
*  Hezbollah's arsenal is 10 times what we have seen from Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=44.4s)]
*  Greater lethality, greater range, the ability to do a lot more destruction in Israel. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  You've seen the Israelis evacuate towns on the northern border. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=53.7s)]
*  Those people are not going to go home so long as that threat remains intact there on the [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=57.220000000000006s)]
*  northern border. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=61.42s)]
*  And so while we may see a tactical play here by the Iranians to try not to induce the Israelis [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=62.42s)]
*  while there's a pause in Gaza to open up a further front in the north, and we know from [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=67.94s)]
*  Washington the White House has been putting out a lot of signals to the Israelis not to [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=72.34s)]
*  escalate in the north, at some point that front will open up, whether it is by Hezbollah [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=76.74000000000001s)]
*  in the Iranian order or by the Israelis, because I don't really know how after they're done [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=82.18s)]
*  in Gaza, they can allow that threat to remain on their northern border. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=87.02s)]
*  The higher the civilian casualties among the Palestinians, the greater the pressure will [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=90.62s)]
*  be on by Arab countries on Hezbollah to fire back at Israel. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=96.86s)]
*  So it's sort of like you're damned if you do, you're damned if you don't. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=103.7s)]
*  Israel has its every right to defend itself, and that is what this war is all about. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=106.78s)]
*  But the more that they defend themselves, unfortunately, civilians will be lost in this [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=112.14s)]
*  tragedy not by the fault of Israel, by the fault of Hamas. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  But unfortunately, if they continue this war, and Benjamin Netanyahu has said after the [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=120.5s)]
*  ceasefire, the war will rage on, if civilian casualties continue, which is inevitable, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=124.78s)]
*  that means Hezbollah is going to have to come in once again, possibly harder, with the whole [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=131.56s)]
*  Arab world watching. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=136.74s)]
*  Well, let's keep in mind, I mean, you just heard Lucas talk about the fact that we have [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=140.29999999999998s)]
*  this Thai hostage release as well. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=143.74s)]
*  Interesting, that was negotiated by Thailand directly with Iran, and Hamas is releasing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=146.46s)]
*  those Thai foreign workers at Iran's direction. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=151.54s)]
*  So let's remember who is behind all of this. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=155.22s)]
*  Ultimately, the Qataris who are negotiating this in Doha, they're but an agent of Hamas, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=157.66s)]
*  a sponsor of Hamas, a partner of Iran. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=163.01999999999998s)]
*  Ultimately, Iran is pulling all the strings. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=165.5s)]
*  And so Iran has a playbook here. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=167.5s)]
*  Remember, this is a regime that is still developing a nuclear weapons capability, long range [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=170.26s)]
*  missiles. They've developed all of these threats around the region. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=175.26s)]
*  They call it a ring of fire. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=178.42s)]
*  They're directing threats against American forces. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  They want to see this de-escalate with Hamas surviving, with their threat in the north [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=183.1s)]
*  intact. And so I think Iran is still holding Hezbollah back to see if they can get this [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=188.06s)]
*  hostage negotiation, the psychological warfare, the international pressure. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=193.42s)]
*  So great that they get the Israelis to have to basically lose this war by their own [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=199.33999999999997s)]
*  unilateral ceasefire. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=204.98s)]
*  And so what we've heard from Netanyahu is saying that he's going to restart the operations [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=206.85999999999999s)]
*  after this pause is very important to complete the mission of destroying Hamas, not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=211.17999999999998s)]
*  allowing Iran to play this for Hamas's advantage, and then having to deal ultimately with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=216.73999999999998s)]
*  that threat in the north as well, but always keeping our eye on Iran itself as they keep [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=222.54s)]
*  advancing that nuclear program. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=227.06s)]
*  And so as long as they continue to advance their nuclear program, and that's been an [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=229.06s)]
*  obvious problem and a slap in the face to the United States, it does make the United [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=233.06s)]
*  States seem weak in the eyes of this war when you look at the power that Iran holds over [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=237.1s)]
*  Israel. What does the White House, what does our administration, first of all, need to [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=244.01999999999998s)]
*  do to change the optics here? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=249.42s)]
*  Well, listen, we just heard in the last couple of weeks of $10 billion being made available [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=252.62s)]
*  to Iran as part of the secret nuclear understanding that the administration is continuing [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=257.38s)]
*  today, basically opening up money spigots for Iran so they don't advance the nuclear [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=262.5s)]
*  weapons program to a 90 percent enrichment threshold, which is weapons grade uranium [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=267.65999999999997s)]
*  production. That program still advances underneath that threshold, but we're paying them [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=273.3s)]
*  basically to stay under that threshold. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=277.82s)]
*  What does that mean right now? [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=280.26s)]
*  Look at the images coming out of Israel. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=281.26s)]
*  Look at the horror show these families are going through, what Hamas is doing. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=283.42s)]
*  The first thing we should do is lock down all the money for this regime in Tehran. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=287.26s)]
*  Totally. We shouldn't be making one cent available to Tehran. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=292.62s)]
*  Start interdicting their oil exports that are going to China and then snap back the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=296.26s)]
*  UN sanctions as well to ensure that there's international pressure on Iran as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=300.86s)]
*  That combined with an incredible military threat could actually start rolling back this [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=305.74s)]
*  threat. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=309.53999999999996s)]
*  That's an excellent point, Rich. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=309.86s)]
*  And former National Security Adviser John Bolton talked about that ring of fire you [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=311.22s)]
*  just mentioned. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=315.94s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=317.14s)]
*  This is the Iranian ring of fire strategy playing out. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=319.7s)]
*  We've now seen almost seven full weeks of Hezbollah attacking targets in northern [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=324.1s)]
*  Israel. This is all part of a larger effort. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=329.86s)]
*  We don't know the exact dimensions of it, but the conflict is real and it's not a [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=334.02s)]
*  Hamas versus Israel war. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=338.82s)]
*  It's a war against one of America's closest allies coordinated by one of our most [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=341.3s)]
*  one of our worst enemies. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=347.74s)]
*  One of our worst enemies indeed. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=349.65999999999997s)]
*  Your final thoughts. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=350.98s)]
*  The ambassador is correct there. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=353.7s)]
*  And I think where we really see the administration getting this wrong, whether by [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=355.21999999999997s)]
*  design or unintentionally, we see them continue to say, you know, it's Putin and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=360.02s)]
*  Hamas are two evils of the world. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=365.65999999999997s)]
*  The president refuses to say Iran. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=368.22s)]
*  He needs to call out Iran as part of that evil access of the world, understanding that [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=370.58s)]
*  it's Iran pulling all the strings here. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=375.06s)]
*  And so if you're upset about what you're seeing on the images of TV today, what [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=377.34000000000003s)]
*  Hamas has done and continues to do, make sure that we change our policy in Washington [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=381.02s)]
*  to start putting pressure on who's really pulling the strings in the Islamic Republic [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=386.3s)]
*  of Iran. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=390.22s)]
*  All right, Richard Goldberg, thank you so much for talking to us. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=391.18s)]
*  We really do appreciate it. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meL76pLopH8&t=394.3s)]
