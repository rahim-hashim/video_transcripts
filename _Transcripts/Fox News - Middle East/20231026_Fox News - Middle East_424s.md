# US cannot take any info out of Hamas at face value: John Kirby
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg)
*  The President yesterday, John, said he has no confidence in the death toll numbers presented [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=0.0s)]
*  by the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=5.28s)]
*  What's he basing that on? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=7.76s)]
*  How did he reach the conclusion? [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=8.76s)]
*  Well, we all know that the Gaza Ministry of Health is just a front for Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=9.76s)]
*  It's run by Hamas, a terrorist organization. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=16.0s)]
*  I've said it myself up here, we can't take anything coming out of Hamas, including the [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=19.28s)]
*  so-called Ministry of Health, at face value. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=24.34s)]
*  Secondly, the President's talking more about humanitarian pause and reviving the Israeli-Palestinian [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=27.84s)]
*  peace process. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=34.08s)]
*  What's prompting this tone shift? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=35.08s)]
*  So two thoughts here, Steve. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=38.96s)]
*  For one, the President has never backed away or never stopped affirming the need for a [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=40.879999999999995s)]
*  two-state solution. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  Since coming into office, we've been working on that very hard. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=48.0s)]
*  I know it's a lofty goal and it's taken a lot of people a long time to try to get there [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  and we haven't gotten there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  But he's not stopped working towards that goal and he still believes, as he said yesterday, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=55.6s)]
*  that when this conflict is over, that still has to be the goal we're driving to, a state [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=61.160000000000004s)]
*  for Palestinians that they can live in peace and security and justice. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=66.8s)]
*  That is a strategic long-term goal. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=71.72s)]
*  In a tactical sense, as Secretary Blinken said, we do think that there should be consideration [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=75.28s)]
*  made right now for humanitarian pauses. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=80.5s)]
*  These are localized, temporary, specific pauses on the battlefield so that humanitarian assistance [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=84.92s)]
*  can get in to people that need it or they, the people, can get out of that area in relative [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=92.8s)]
*  safety. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=99.8s)]
*  That's what a humanitarian pause is and we think it's an idea worth exploring. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=100.8s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=103.8s)]
*  Just to follow up on the first thing that Steve asked you quickly about the President's [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=104.8s)]
*  lack of confidence in the numbers that we're getting out of Gaza right now. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=107.8s)]
*  As you noted, the Gaza Health Ministry is run by Hamas. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=111.44s)]
*  But to be clear, the President and the White House, you don't dispute that thousands of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=114.84s)]
*  Palestinians, many of them innocent civilians, have been killed by Israeli strikes so far, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=119.56s)]
*  do you? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  Of course not. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  We absolutely know that the death toll continues to rise in Gaza. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  Of course we know that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=129.92s)]
*  But what we're saying is that we shouldn't rely on numbers put forth by Hamas and the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=131.0s)]
*  Ministry of Health. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=136.48s)]
*  They say it's more than 7,000. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=137.48s)]
*  Is there any way to assess how many it is? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=138.48s)]
*  I mean, the President said it was a pretty dramatic moment when he said, yeah, we don't [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=140.64s)]
*  have any confidence in that. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=143.84s)]
*  We respect that you can't take Hamas at its word, but it does appear by all independent [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=145.04s)]
*  journalism, including that by a lot of people in the room, that thousands of Palestinians [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=149.51999999999998s)]
*  have been killed. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=153.32s)]
*  We would not dispute that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=154.32s)]
*  Okay, let me ask you if I can very quickly. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=155.32s)]
*  Is the White House satisfied that Israel to this point has obeyed the laws of war, the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=157.39999999999998s)]
*  rules of war as the President has indicated? [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=163.23999999999998s)]
*  And is Israel, in the White House's view, doing enough to this point to protect innocent [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=166.28s)]
*  lives? [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=171.44s)]
*  Again, we're not going to react in real time to events unfolding on the battlefield and [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=172.44s)]
*  every allegation and every strike. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=176.84s)]
*  We're just not going to do that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=179.56s)]
*  But that means it's not until the war is completed that you guys can have an assessment of whether [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=180.56s)]
*  there are weapons? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=184.32s)]
*  I didn't say that either. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=185.32s)]
*  I just said we're not going to react in real time here, Peter. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=186.32s)]
*  We have been in constant touch with our Israeli counterparts since the very early hours of [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=188.16s)]
*  To make sure we're asking them the hard questions that we want them to ask themselves and to [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=194.04s)]
*  reiterate, as the President said yesterday, to reiterate that there is an added burden [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=198.88s)]
*  here in Israel to make sure that they are doing everything they can to minimize civilian [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=203.92s)]
*  casualties. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=207.76s)]
*  And we're in constant communication with them about that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=208.76s)]
*  Thanks, Corrine. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=211.23999999999998s)]
*  John, to follow up on my colleagues' questions, does the President have faith in the numbers [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=212.23999999999998s)]
*  released by the West Bank Ministry of Health, which is run by Palestinian authorities? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=217.64s)]
*  As I said, there's been more than 100 West Bank Palestinians killed by what the President [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=222.96s)]
*  called extremist [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=229.0s)]
*  And what kind of role can the U.S. expect from China on the war in Gaza? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=251.1s)]
*  That was one more question. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=255.57999999999998s)]
*  That was like seven more questions. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=256.98s)]
*  Mr. Sullivan's looking forward to this discussion with Wang Yi. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=260.38s)]
*  I think you know he's going to be starting out with meeting Secretary Blinken later this [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=264.06s)]
*  afternoon and then tomorrow with Jake here at the White House. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=267.34s)]
*  And it's a chance to continue the conversation that Jake himself has had with our PRC counterparts [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=271.26s)]
*  now for many, many months. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=278.12s)]
*  It's another milestone in that effort to keep the lines of communication open with the PRC. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=280.9s)]
*  Now it'll be an opportunity for Mr. Sullivan to obviously address areas of concern that [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=287.58s)]
*  we continue to have with some of the PRC behavior, particularly in the South China Sea. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=293.65999999999997s)]
*  But it'll also be an opportunity to explore ways in which we can continue to keep these [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=299.85999999999996s)]
*  channels open and to try to get open the military-to-military channel of communication, which is a very important [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=304.97999999999996s)]
*  which is still closed. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=310.78s)]
*  What about the rule of the Gaza? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=311.78s)]
*  China's role in the conflict in Gaza? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=315.38s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=316.85999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I have no doubt that part of this discussion and the agenda will be what's going on in [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=317.85999999999996s)]
*  the Middle East and getting the Chinese perspective and certainly looking for ways to encourage [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=322.82s)]
*  them to be helpful. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=328.55999999999995s)]
*  Go ahead, Michael. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=330.05999999999995s)]
*  Thank you, Green. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=331.05999999999995s)]
*  John, the Florida governor says that the state is sending weapons and drones to Israel at [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=332.05999999999995s)]
*  the request of the consulate in Miami. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=339.02s)]
*  Have you been coordinating with the Florida government on this and can states just send [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=342.65999999999997s)]
*  weapons and other material to foreign states? [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=347.18s)]
*  I would certainly let the governor speak to what Florida's doing. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=352.34s)]
*  It is not illegal for the governor of a state to offer a measure of foreign assistance to [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=356.78s)]
*  another country. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  There are laws and regulations which govern how the export process is handled, and that's [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=364.66s)]
*  all done through commerce. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=373.26000000000005s)]
*  I couldn't speak with authority today about whether the governor has checked all those [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=374.38000000000005s)]
*  boxes or not. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=380.58000000000004s)]
*  You really should talk to him and his staff, but it's not illegal for a state governor [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=381.58000000000004s)]
*  to do that kind of thing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=386.26000000000005s)]
*  Just one quick follow-up on all of the questions regarding the death toll coming out of the [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=387.26000000000005s)]
*  health ministry in Gaza. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=394.14s)]
*  Do you have any sense? [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=395.97999999999996s)]
*  You acknowledge that thousands have died in Gaza. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=398.46s)]
*  Do you have any sense of the percentage of those that are Hamas militants versus civilians? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=401.46s)]
*  I do not. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=406.46s)]
*  Hey, everyone. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaHwOUDtUYg&t=407.46s)]
