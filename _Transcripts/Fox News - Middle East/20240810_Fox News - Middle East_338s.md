# Columbia students suing for '10s of millions' in damages over pro-terror protests: Daniel Suhr
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g)
*  Five Columbia University students and graduates filed a class action lawsuit this week against [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=0.0s)]
*  organizers of the anti-Israel protest that shut down the campus at the end of the spring [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=8.4s)]
*  semester. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=14.48s)]
*  The suit also lists some lawmakers for defending those protests. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=15.48s)]
*  Two similar cases at Harvard and MIT have already been tested. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=19.48s)]
*  One judge ruling the Harvard lawsuit can proceed, but another shut down the one brought against [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=23.88s)]
*  MIT. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=29.8s)]
*  Fox News has reached out to the defendants in the Columbia case for comment and we have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=30.8s)]
*  yet to hear back. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=35.28s)]
*  Meantime, lead counsel in the Columbia suit, Daniel Serr, joins me now. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=36.76s)]
*  So Daniel, first of all, who are the organizers and what's the legal complaint against them? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=40.92s)]
*  This really starts with Students for Justice in Palestine. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=47.96s)]
*  It's a radicalized organization with networks nationwide. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=51.24s)]
*  The fact that these happened on campuses across the country at the same time isn't an accident, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=55.5s)]
*  but really it goes to a larger network of left-wing agitators of people in Congress, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=60.86s)]
*  in the unions, that this was a coordinated effort to highlight this issue. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=67.94s)]
*  But in doing so, they shut down Columbia University and my clients and tens of thousands of other [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=72.64s)]
*  students paid tuition for an education they didn't receive. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=78.14s)]
*  That's the result of the illegal acts of these left-wing agitators. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=83.14s)]
*  And so we're suing to get compensation and hopefully to deter this from happening again [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=87.46s)]
*  in the future. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=91.46s)]
*  So you said if you win the lawsuit, the students will get compensation. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=92.46s)]
*  Do we have an idea of what you're suing for? [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=96.86s)]
*  Can you tell us how much? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=98.62s)]
*  This is going to be tens of millions of dollars in damages here if you think about every student [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=100.97999999999999s)]
*  at Columbia, because every student at Columbia paid for a full education. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=106.22s)]
*  That's not what they got. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=111.56s)]
*  They paid for a commencement. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=112.56s)]
*  Every member of the class of 2024 was denied that commencement ceremony because of the [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=114.88s)]
*  security risk and the unsafe environment that was created by these on-campus agitators. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=120.0s)]
*  Let's take a look, Daniel, at a scrolling list of anti-Israel protests at all of the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=128.16s)]
*  top 50 universities. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=135.4s)]
*  You know, when we're talking about what's at stake with this lawsuit, what is at stake [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=138.73999999999998s)]
*  in terms of precedent? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=144.7s)]
*  Yeah, this is hugely important, not just for Columbia, but I think for every university [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=146.7s)]
*  across the country. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  When school goes back in just a couple of weeks, we're going to see another surge in [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=153.5s)]
*  activism. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=158.42s)]
*  And the question is simple. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=159.62s)]
*  Are the activists going to follow the rules and follow the law? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=161.38s)]
*  And our university is going to ensure that anti-Semitic behavior has no place on their [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=166.08s)]
*  campus, that hate speech has no place on their campus. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=170.68s)]
*  We've already seen at Columbia what can happen when these things get out of control, when [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=174.6s)]
*  the students take over, and that's not what we want at any of these top universities or [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=179.24s)]
*  really any of the schools. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=184.36s)]
*  Our kids are paying so much. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=185.94s)]
*  They deserve a good education. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=187.66s)]
*  That's what the schools should be providing, and we shouldn't tolerate illegal activity [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=189.52s)]
*  by some student activists. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=194.16s)]
*  Are you working with the universities to keep these agitators off campus? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=197.88s)]
*  Are you working on that end as well? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=203.27999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, so the universities have a separate legal obligation under a federal law known [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=206.48s)]
*  as Title 6 that requires them to ensure that their students have a safe learning environment, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=210.83999999999997s)]
*  that they're not discriminated against based on race or religion. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=216.48s)]
*  And so I think there are serious concerns from the university side that they need to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=220.1s)]
*  ensure there's no anti-Semitic behavior or hate speech happening on their campuses. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=224.82s)]
*  But the real foundation for that is that we shouldn't have student activists breaking [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=229.86s)]
*  the rules, taking over campus, taking over buildings, taking janitor's hostage, shutting [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=235.1s)]
*  down schools in the first place. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=240.62s)]
*  Those are the people that we sued because ultimately they're the ones who broke the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=242.86s)]
*  rules, they're the ones who broke the law, and they need to be held accountable. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=246.32000000000002s)]
*  And if those students, if you're suing students, they don't have money, would their parents [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=251.84s)]
*  have to pay? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=257.08s)]
*  Well, I think there is a large nationwide network that is behind these student organizations. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  We have sued not only the student groups, but the faculty who enabled this, the faculty [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=264.76s)]
*  unions, who are the ones out there who remember the visual image. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=270.72s)]
*  And some lawmakers as well. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=274.44s)]
*  Yeah, tell me about the lawmakers. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=275.74s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=276.74s)]
*  Three members of the so-called squad actually showed up on campus illegally trespassed onto [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=277.74s)]
*  Columbia's campus and were encouraging the students to continue in their illegal behavior. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=283.82s)]
*  Well, you can't do that. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=289.02s)]
*  When you encourage people to break the law, we call that incitement. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=290.02s)]
*  It's not protected by the First Amendment. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=293.38s)]
*  And in fact, you can be legally liable, as I think these lawmakers will be, for inciting [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=295.02s)]
*  other people to break the law. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=300.42s)]
*  You can't do that. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=302.62s)]
*  The First Amendment doesn't protect that. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=303.62s)]
*  Incitement is not protected by the First Amendment. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=306.44s)]
*  Daniel Surer, thank you very much. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=312.02s)]
*  Keep us posted, would you? [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vYFmNr3M8g&t=314.14s)]
