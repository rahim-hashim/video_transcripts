# Biden admin's failed foreign policy has resulted in all this: Rep Cory Mills
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=0.0s)]
*  You're taking a live look at explosions rocking Gaza right now as the IDF ramps up its operations [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=2.48s)]
*  both through the air and on the ground. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=8.28s)]
*  And it's a race against time for U.S. citizens stuck in Israel, but GOP Congressman Cory [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=10.72s)]
*  Mills is stepping up. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=14.98s)]
*  Yesterday he coordinated his second flight to get more stranded Americans out safely. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=17.0s)]
*  Florida Congressman Cory Mills joins us now. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=22.76s)]
*  Great to see you, Congressman. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=25.2s)]
*  We remember that you did something like this when it came to Afghanistan. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=26.96s)]
*  Now here we are once again when it comes to Israel. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=31.060000000000002s)]
*  Well, again, it just shows that the Biden administration doesn't prioritize the safety [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=33.04s)]
*  of American lives. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=36.480000000000004s)]
*  We saw it in 2021 when we were conducting ground operations, getting out fellow Texans [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=37.72s)]
*  that had been stranded, a mother and three children born and raised in Amarillo, Texas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=41.660000000000004s)]
*  When I saw what was occurring and I knew kind of the destabilization that was going [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=46.24s)]
*  to go on because Iran really wants to break down that normalization process that was going [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=49.24s)]
*  the KSA and Israel to build out and expand the Abram Accords. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=54.8s)]
*  I knew that we were going to see a very similar thing, whether it's Secretary Blinken, Lloyd [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=59.28s)]
*  Austin or President Biden. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=62.44s)]
*  They have no plan, no strategy, no way to actually prioritize the American lives. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=64.17999999999999s)]
*  It's all about their failed foreign policy that's resulted in all this. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=68.28s)]
*  And so if Joe Biden's unwilling to do his job, then there's other Americans who will [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=71.86s)]
*  step up and do it for him. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=75.16s)]
*  And this has been urgent. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=76.47999999999999s)]
*  Explain to our audience, you know, you just got this last group out, but barely. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=77.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=81.36s)]
*  The thing that just came in, we had 159 that was on this and pretty much one of the last [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=82.36s)]
*  flights as soon as ground operations and IDF started moving, they ceased all civilian aircrafts [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=86.52s)]
*  coming out of Tel Aviv. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=90.68s)]
*  So usually when there's a rescue operation like this, you think you have all these government [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=92.2s)]
*  resources behind you. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=96.28s)]
*  When you're doing this independently, what can you count on? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=97.5s)]
*  Yourself, yourself and your team. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=100.76s)]
*  And that was the thing. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Now I've spent over 20 years throughout the Middle East, obviously from the Iraq War in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=103.96000000000001s)]
*  03 and all the way through. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=107.56s)]
*  And I speak fluent Arabic, which actually does help when you're on the ground. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=108.9s)]
*  I've been going through Jordan. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=112.12s)]
*  So when I went over there, we actually conducted the first day, 32 Americans that we ground [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=113.12s)]
*  evaced out of areas like Haifa and Nazareth, Tiberias up by the Syrian area. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=117.64s)]
*  On the second day I went and we ended up getting 45 out and we were able to go through the [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=121.96s)]
*  West Bank and through Jerusalem and some of the other outer areas closer moving into the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  South. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=129.28s)]
*  And so it really is one of those things where you get on the ground and you figure it out [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=130.28s)]
*  where in the military we just adapt and overcome. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=133.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=136.12s)]
*  Awesome story, Congressman. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=137.12s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=138.12s)]
*  Not as awesome story coming out of Congress with a different congressman. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=139.12s)]
*  Jamal Bowman, he pled guilty to, I guess, pulling the fire alarm. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=142.44s)]
*  I'm trying to pick my words correctly because there were some he's still not admitting intention [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=148.24s)]
*  in some way. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=152.72s)]
*  But in this video right here comes out afterwards, you can see walks up, he takes down the signs, [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=153.72s)]
*  throws them on the ground, walks over, pulls the fire alarm and then walks back out the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=157.76000000000002s)]
*  same way he came in. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=162.04000000000002s)]
*  You know, just total BS the idea that he thought it was going to release the door and tried [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  to walk through. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=168.60000000000002s)]
*  Well, and the lack of integrity. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=169.60000000000002s)]
*  I mean, look, he tried to act as if he didn't know and it was just opening the doors, what [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  he originally said. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=173.84s)]
*  But people fail to remember he worked in a school. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=174.84s)]
*  They gave actual tutoring on, hey, don't pull these fire alarms. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=177.2s)]
*  Don't do this. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=181.04s)]
*  Don't do that. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=182.04s)]
*  In my personal opinion, it's intentional, criminal and malicious. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=183.04s)]
*  I think that he should at minimum be censured, but I would actually vote to have him expelled. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  I know Congresswoman Malia Talkis has put a bill or put a resolution on the floor that [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=189.39999999999998s)]
*  would actually expel him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=193.64s)]
*  I would happily support that. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=194.88s)]
*  I've already endorsed or sorry, endorsed, co-sponsored Lisa McClain's bill that actually [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=196.32s)]
*  censures him. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=200.72s)]
*  You know what is BS? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=201.72s)]
*  That this video came out now. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=202.84s)]
*  I guarantee you that if that was Marjorie Taylor Greene that this would have been out [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=204.28s)]
*  on that day. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=209.28s)]
*  Here's the other thing. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=210.28s)]
*  I'm surprised Donald Trump hasn't been blamed for it. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=211.28s)]
*  I agree. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=212.68s)]
*  He also said this is Bowman. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=213.68s)]
*  He says I'm now that he's been charged, he says he's happy for a quick resolution. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=215.52s)]
*  There were no quick resolutions for the J sixers who were accused of the same thing, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=220.16s)]
*  which was, you know, interrupting. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=224.6s)]
*  Look at his sweetheart plea. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=227.44s)]
*  It's basically, okay, well, I'm going to pay a fine and then after a certain amount of [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=228.56s)]
*  time it's going to be expunged and or pulled away. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=231.2s)]
*  Would anyone else who has committed this, which they're now labeling only as a misdemeanor, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=233.56s)]
*  which I think with criminal intent, it should be at minimum a low class felony. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=238.12s)]
*  Would anyone else get that same sweetheart deal? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=241.72s)]
*  And to your point, if it was Marjorie Taylor Greene or a Lauren Bovert or a Matt Gaetz [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=243.48s)]
*  or any of those, would they have gotten this type of sweetheart deal or were they throwing [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  him onto the bus? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=249.88s)]
*  I know that the world is, I know that the world is blowing up right now. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=250.88s)]
*  It's crazy. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=253.84s)]
*  But will just out of principle, the Republicans and the new speaker prioritize absolutely [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=254.84s)]
*  throwing the book at this guy? [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=259.88s)]
*  Well, I don't think that we're going to prioritize anything on Bowman. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=261.0s)]
*  We've prioritized securing our border and physical responsibility, but I can tell you [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=263.56s)]
*  getting accountability of all members of Congress is definitely something that the speaker Mike [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=266.52s)]
*  Johnson will definitely do. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=271.66s)]
*  And by the way, what a blessing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=272.66s)]
*  Mike Johnson is one of the most constitutionally principled faith based individuals that we [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=274.96s)]
*  could possibly have gotten in a speaker. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=279.12s)]
*  He believes in a member driven, not speaker driven process to decentralize things. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=281.48s)]
*  This is the return of power and limited government overreach that we need. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=285.52000000000004s)]
*  Good. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=288.52000000000004s)]
*  Looks good so far. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=289.52000000000004s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=290.52000000000004s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DainbBZ5uks&t=291.52000000000004s)]
