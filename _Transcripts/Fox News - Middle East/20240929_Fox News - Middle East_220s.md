# Israel is in a ‘fight’ for its life: Senate candidate
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4)
*  We're here with a great patriot, a man who is a former U.S. Army paratrooper who's running [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=0.0s)]
*  for the Senate seat as a Republican nominee in Pennsylvania, Dave McCormick, who's also [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=6.26s)]
*  a very good friend of mine in the family. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=11.72s)]
*  I didn't know him before, but I've gotten to know him, and he would be a fantastic upgrade [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=13.76s)]
*  to that Senate seat in Pennsylvania, where Mr. McGoo shows up and doesn't show up, and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=18.0s)]
*  nobody really hears from Bob Casey very much. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=25.36s)]
*  Dave McCormick, welcome. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=28.240000000000002s)]
*  Well, Dave McCormick, let me start this way. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=29.24s)]
*  You're a former Army paratrooper. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=33.68s)]
*  You see what the Israelis, the IDF, have done with Hezbollah. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=36.44s)]
*  You see what they have done with the leader of Hezbollah. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=40.8s)]
*  And we have an administration that doesn't give its full-throated support. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=45.64s)]
*  We have an administration that wants to ceasefire. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=51.06s)]
*  We have an administration that's withholding arms from Israel. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=53.480000000000004s)]
*  Isn't this our fight, too, and the fight for the West and freedom, not just Israel's [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=59.199999999999996s)]
*  fight, and this little country's kind of taking it off on its own, and we should have their [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=64.64s)]
*  back rather than stabbing them in the back? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=68.72s)]
*  What are your thoughts about that? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=70.64s)]
*  Mark, absolutely. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=73.4s)]
*  You know, as you know, my wife and I went to Israel right after, well, early in the [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=74.4s)]
*  new year, as soon as we could after October 7th. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=79.12s)]
*  We saw firsthand. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=81.67999999999999s)]
*  We walked through Kfar Azzar, saw the butchery. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=83.14s)]
*  You can't go there and see the horrible things that were done by Hamas and not think that [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  America needs to stand by its closest ally Israel in eradicating Hamas. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=93.48s)]
*  But it's not just Hamas. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=98.12s)]
*  It's Hezbollah, it's Islamic Jihad. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=99.38000000000001s)]
*  And the original sin was the Iran deal in 2015, which Obama did, and the deciding vote [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=101.44000000000001s)]
*  was my opponent, Bob Casey. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=108.44000000000001s)]
*  And now we have a situation where Israel's in the fight for their life, and they're conducting [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=110.84s)]
*  that fight, the IDF's conducting that fight with incredible competence. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=115.12s)]
*  Think about it this way. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=119.03999999999999s)]
*  When I was in the 82nd, the toughest kind of fighting is urban warfare. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=119.8s)]
*  In Gaza, what we have is urban warfare. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=124.67999999999999s)]
*  It's block to block, street to street, building to building, room to room. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=127.4s)]
*  But it's two cities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=130.68s)]
*  There's an entire city underneath the ground that was underwritten by taxpayer dollars [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=132.12s)]
*  through the UN and by Iran. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=137.84s)]
*  And now we see incredible competence in taking out the terrorist leaders of Hezbollah. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=141.16s)]
*  They've been raining terror on Israel. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=145.8s)]
*  And I give the IDF, I take my hat off to their effectiveness, and I met with the IDF. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=148.4s)]
*  What they're doing in Gaza and around their operations to try to protect civilians, to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=155.84s)]
*  give early warning, is really exceptional. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=162.4s)]
*  So listen, there's no way to negotiate with people who want to slit your throat in the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=165.48000000000002s)]
*  middle of the night. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=169.92s)]
*  And America needs to stand behind Israel in his fight. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=171.0s)]
*  And what we have with Biden, Harris and Bob Casey has been weakness. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=174.12s)]
*  We've also seen weakness at home in the fight against anti-Semitism. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=177.92s)]
*  And my opponent, Bob Casey, not only signed the Iran deal, he has endorsed Summer Lee, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=181.56s)]
*  my congresswoman in Pittsburgh, who's an avowed anti-Semite. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=188.28s)]
*  He was reluctant to call for the ouster of Liz McGill, the president of Penn, despite her [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=192.12s)]
*  absolute lack of moral courage. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=197.56s)]
*  So this is a guy who's not stood up when Israelis and Jewish Americans needed him most. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=199.64000000000001s)]
*  And that's what I'll bring to the Senate. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SzY_0SGtlT4&t=206.08s)]
