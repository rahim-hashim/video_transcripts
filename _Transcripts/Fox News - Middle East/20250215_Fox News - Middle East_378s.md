# Will Israel target the ‘head of the snake’ in the Middle East?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0)
*  Hello everyone, I'm Nicole Sapphire along with Griff Jenkins, Miranda Devine and Joe [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=0.0s)]
*  Concha and welcome to The Big Weekend Show. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=4.2s)]
*  The big story tonight is a Fox News alert. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=6.58s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio has now arrived in Israel for his upcoming meeting with Israeli [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu as President Trump's deadline for Hamas to release all [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=14.540000000000001s)]
*  hostages has passed. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=19.26s)]
*  Now we'll see what the president meant when he issued this warning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=21.22s)]
*  As far as I'm concerned, if all of the hostages aren't returned by Saturday at 12 o'clock, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=25.5s)]
*  I think it's an appropriate time, I would say cancel it and all bets are off and let [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=31.82s)]
*  hell break out. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=38.94s)]
*  And if they're not returned, all of them, not in drips and drabs, not two and one and [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=39.94s)]
*  three and four and two. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=44.96s)]
*  Saturday at 12 o'clock and after that I would say all hell is going to break out. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  We want them all back. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=55.3s)]
*  I'm speaking for myself. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=56.5s)]
*  Israel can override it, but for myself, Saturday at 12 o'clock and if they're not here, all [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=58.099999999999994s)]
*  hell is going to break out. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=65.97999999999999s)]
*  Hamas only released three hostages today, including one American. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=68.14s)]
*  President Trump took to Truth Social earlier to say, quote, Israel will now have to decide [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=72.7s)]
*  what they will do about the 12 o'clock today deadline imposed on the release of all hostages. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=77.18s)]
*  The United States will back the decision they make and Israel's ambassador to the United [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  Nations says all options are on the table for a response. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=87.04s)]
*  We are preparing for all options. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=91.34s)]
*  The military is ready, is capable, but at the same time, we worked hard and the U.S. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=93.5s)]
*  supported these efforts to achieve this framework. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=99.98s)]
*  It wasn't easy for the government to approve this framework, but I think that will be the [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=103.98s)]
*  decision in front of the cabinet, whether to move ahead with a proposal coming from [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=108.10000000000001s)]
*  the U.S. or to move forward with the framework and to get as many hostages as we can arrive. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=113.10000000000001s)]
*  Let's go to Greg Palkot, who is in Israel with the latest. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=121.82000000000001s)]
*  Hi, Greg. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=124.38000000000001s)]
*  Nicole, three more hostages released by the Hamas Militant Group today. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=125.38s)]
*  The hostage deal and the ceasefire, however, remains very much a work in progress. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=132.29999999999998s)]
*  Among those released, 36-year-old American Israeli Sagu Dekel-Chen, 27-year-old Russian [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=137.62s)]
*  Israeli Alexander Sasha Trufanov and 46-year-old Argentine-born Yair Horn. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=143.06s)]
*  After 498 days captive, brought from Gaza to a nearby military base and then area hospitals. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=148.22s)]
*  The wife, mother and father of Dekel-Chen greeted Sagu with jubilation, exultation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=154.6s)]
*  The freed hostages appear at least to be in better shape than those released last week. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=159.72s)]
*  This is those released received mixed news. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=164.72s)]
*  Sasha Trufanov learned his father was killed on October 7th. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=166.92s)]
*  Yair Horn, with his mother and brother, another brother, is still being held by Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=170.92s)]
*  And Dekel-Chen was to meet for the first time his new daughter. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=175.79999999999998s)]
*  In exchange for all this, some 369 Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli jails. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=178.76s)]
*  36 of them were serving life sentences. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=184.24s)]
*  Hamas looking for more releases and more assurances about Gaza. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=186.44s)]
*  As for that threat by President Trump earlier in the week of a deadline today for all hostages [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=190.36s)]
*  to be released or else, Trump noted in a post it didn't happen, but he also left any response [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=195.52s)]
*  to Israel. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=200.60000000000002s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears to be settling on the three hostages released [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=201.84s)]
*  today, but he and U.S. officials are looking for more to be released faster. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=206.4s)]
*  Tomorrow, Secretary of State Rubio meets with the Prime Minister. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=211.32s)]
*  Nicole. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=214.79999999999998s)]
*  Thanks so much, Greg. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  So, Griff, we're in the middle of a ceasefire, a ceasefire that commenced less than 24 hours [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=218.48s)]
*  before President Trump took over the White House again. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  And in this first phase, it has essentially been release of hostages with the exchange [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=228.2s)]
*  for criminals and also Israel has had to supply Gaza with tents and some other aid supplies. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Over today, 21 hostages had been released. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=238.6s)]
*  Three more innocent hostages released today. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=240.79999999999998s)]
*  In exchange, over 1,000 Palestinian criminals have been released from the jail. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=243.62s)]
*  Of those just released today, 36 life sentences for deadly attacks against Israeli. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=248.35999999999999s)]
*  What I can't understand is how can people still be calling for telling Israel that they [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  have to accept a two-state solution with these clear anti-Semitic terrorists when clearly [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=259.18s)]
*  they're rebuilding their army? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=264.32s)]
*  You know, Nicole, it's very fascinating. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=266.0s)]
*  When you look at the video that Greg Pankow was just showing of Sego Dikkelchen greeting [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=267.78s)]
*  his wife and Greg mentioned it, but it wasn't towards the top. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=272.21999999999997s)]
*  His baby was born during the nearly 500 days he was in captivity. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=275.67999999999995s)]
*  And when you think about that, it really brings home though time has passed and though there [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=281.41999999999996s)]
*  are difficult decisions almost on a business level are being made trading bad people for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=285.46s)]
*  getting hostages back, you understand, I think, a little bit of President Trump's thinking. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=291.96s)]
*  He said, I'm just speaking for myself, but it's high noon on Saturday. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=297.3s)]
*  And the fact that that gentleman's baby was born, he gets fortunately to see it for the [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=300.74s)]
*  first time, a daughter, but it brings home the atrocity that was committed. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=306.46000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, the baby was born two months after October 7th. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=309.7s)]
*  Miranda, this is a very different approach. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=313.58000000000004s)]
*  President Trump versus former President Biden. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=316.26s)]
*  Under President Biden, there were three American hostages that were released from negotiations. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=318.54s)]
*  Twelve so far under President Trump. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=323.58000000000004s)]
*  What's your take? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=325.46000000000004s)]
*  Look, it just makes you wonder why it took President Trump to come into office for the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=326.62s)]
*  full power of the American state to be placed on releasing these hostages. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=332.46s)]
*  There was a softly, softly approach that came from the Biden administration, which is inexplicable. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=338.34s)]
*  So it's good that we have American power back showing its face again. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=343.96s)]
*  I guess now the bulls in Israel's court and whether or not they're going to go after the [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=349.21999999999997s)]
*  head of the snake, which is Iran, that's the big question I think we'll find out in [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=355.26s)]
*  the next couple of days. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=359.58s)]
*  It certainly will. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=360.58s)]
*  But President Trump is making it clear that Israel has the United States' support, which [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=361.7s)]
*  is something we've been wanting to hear for a long time. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_IRLrSSBB0&t=365.53999999999996s)]
