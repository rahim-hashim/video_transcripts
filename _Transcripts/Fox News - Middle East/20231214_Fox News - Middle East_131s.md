# Police disrupt Hamas terror plans in Europe
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c)
*  John, members of Hamas and others accused of planning terrorist attacks in Europe have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=0.0s)]
*  been arrested in Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=4.66s)]
*  Alex Hogan is on this. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=7.7s)]
*  She's live in London for us. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=8.82s)]
*  Alex, what exactly do we know as this story is just breaking? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=10.26s)]
*  Hi, Sandra. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=14.02s)]
*  So multiple arrests across multiple countries, all of these people accused of attempting [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=15.540000000000001s)]
*  to carry out terrorist attacks. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=20.64s)]
*  The prosecutors say at least three of them are long-standing members of Hamas. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=22.5s)]
*  Now, what we do know at this point, authorities say they are on high alert. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=27.0s)]
*  Three people were detained in Germany. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=30.56s)]
*  One person was detained in the Netherlands and three others were arrested in Denmark [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=32.42s)]
*  on suspicion of terrorism. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=35.82s)]
*  And Israel has linked all seven people to Hamas, although Denmark has not specifically [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=37.519999999999996s)]
*  named Hamas yet. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=42.44s)]
*  Now, as is usual in these types of cases, the full names of those who have been arrested [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=43.44s)]
*  have not been released. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=47.84s)]
*  But this is what we do know of the German-led investigation. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=48.84s)]
*  Two men are from Egypt. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=52.239999999999995s)]
*  One man who was born in Lebanon was reportedly tasked by Hamas to take weapons to Berlin, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=53.660000000000004s)]
*  according to investigators. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=59.3s)]
*  And one man is a Dutch national. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=60.3s)]
*  He's in his 50s and he was arrested in Rotterdam, but he's also linked to the Danish operation, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=62.78s)]
*  which just exemplifies how connected these different cases are and the extent of the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=68.74s)]
*  threat level. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=74.02s)]
*  Law enforcement say that they prevented a major attack. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=75.02s)]
*  This is as serious as it gets, and I am pleased with the work of the authorities, but it shows [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=77.9s)]
*  something about the kind of situation we are in, in Denmark. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=84.32000000000001s)]
*  German leaders say that attacks on Jewish people there have increased in recent weeks, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=88.92s)]
*  and the Danish justice minister says that this just confirms that Danish Jews are also [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=92.80000000000001s)]
*  under threat. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=97.48s)]
*  Denmark will also reinforce police presences around Jewish institutions in Copenhagen. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=98.88000000000001s)]
*  Earlier this month, the EU Home Affairs Commissioner warned that there is an increased risk of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=104.32s)]
*  attacks, specifically terrorist attacks, around the holidays. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=109.96s)]
*  As far as these three who have been arrested in Germany, they will go before a judge tomorrow. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=113.19999999999999s)]
*  Alexandra? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=117.47999999999999s)]
*  Alex Hogan on that live from London for us. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=118.47999999999999s)]
*  Alex, thank you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=119.96s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXqirWJek-c&t=120.96s)]
