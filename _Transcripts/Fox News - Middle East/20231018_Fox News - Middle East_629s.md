# Biden arrives in Israel as IDF blames Islamic Jihad for Gaza hospital blast
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM)
*  Former Assistant Secretary of State for George W. Bush, Robert Charles. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=0.0s)]
*  And Robert, we're again joining you as we look at images from moments ago, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=4.32s)]
*  President Biden meeting Benjamin Netanyahu and the entire Israeli delegation. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=9.08s)]
*  And look, it cannot be overstated the fact that two great allies are meeting in a [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=13.92s)]
*  time of war. It is a sign to the rest of the world that we are united. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=19.44s)]
*  But nevertheless, Robert, should Joe Biden still have Mabish trip following [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=24.560000000000002s)]
*  the cancellation of the Jordan stop? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=29.8s)]
*  You know, honestly, Todd, diplomacy under these circumstances historically and [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=34.2s)]
*  today is hard, and I'm glad the president is there. The number one message [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=38.56s)]
*  I think he should be delivering beyond unity is is is that this should not [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=44.04s)]
*  escalate. And escalation is is the great fear right now. And you've got an [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=49.56s)]
*  awful lot of innocence in this region who don't want to see war escalate. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  You have three groups in the last 24 hours that have launched rockets into [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=59.36s)]
*  Israel. One of them is Islamic Jihad has just mentioned. Another is the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=63.2s)]
*  militant arm of Hamas has just mentioned and also Fattah. They've all [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=66.96000000000001s)]
*  they've all launched rockets on Israel and his ball is in the wings. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=71.2s)]
*  But if you step back 20 paces, what you're really watching here is the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=75.52000000000001s)]
*  opening of a second major proxy war. This one is against Iran, which has [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=79.44s)]
*  funded all three of those groups and frankly also has blah. And the second, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=85.88s)]
*  of course, is what we've got it going in Ukraine. So we're in a really in a [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  two front war right now. And I honestly, although I cannot imagine past leaders [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=94.92s)]
*  of the region, including President Abdullah, canceling on any other [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=101.32000000000001s)]
*  president, I think the president has to do what the president has to do. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=104.84s)]
*  And when you put Air Force One down on David Ben-Gurion Airport and you have [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=108.68s)]
*  him get out and give a hug to Netanyahu, you're saying, look, I'm here. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=113.64s)]
*  This conflict is one that I'm focused upon. I will tell you again, I think a [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=119.0s)]
*  lot of this I hate to do Monday morning quarterbacking, but just like [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=123.88s)]
*  Afghanistan, just like the invitation to an incursion in Ukraine, this was an [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=127.64s)]
*  avoidable, I think an avoidable conflict. Terrorist groups are always out there. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=132.6s)]
*  But when you green light Iran by imagining that they're a real player [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=136.84s)]
*  in some way that would contribute to peace, I think you've misconceived the [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=141.32000000000002s)]
*  entire environment. They basically gave up on the Abrahamic Accords that had [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  been started by President Trump. And ultimately, if those accords had gone [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=151.96s)]
*  forward, you might have finally seen a sit down and some discussion of peace [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=156.20000000000002s)]
*  with the Palestinians. Ten years ago, 15 years ago, we were in a better place [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=160.92000000000002s)]
*  than we are now. And I'm afraid that we're really on the cusp, as you both have said, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=165.0s)]
*  as all of your reporting has said, we're on the cusp of an escalation. And if [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=169.48s)]
*  there's any message to be delivered by the president, it should be I'm calling [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=173.79999999999998s)]
*  on this entire region not to escalate this. Terrorism is wrong. Peace is worth [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=177.48s)]
*  fighting for and innocent lives can be saved if we don't escalate. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=182.44s)]
*  Yeah. And that is the frightening part about all of this, the uncertainty for [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=186.6s)]
*  what could possibly come. And it isn't just Israel in the surrounding areas. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  Robert Reuters is reporting that the U.S. military thwarted a drone attack [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=194.2s)]
*  that was attempting to target Al-Assad Air Base in Iraq, which hosts American [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=198.28s)]
*  troops. And then these images out of Lebanon overnight, these mass protests [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=203.0s)]
*  that took place there in the U.S. Embassy compound in Beirut. There was a large fire [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=207.32s)]
*  there. Also, there were major protests surrounding the French embassy as well. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=213.88s)]
*  So this is Lebanon. This is the country to the north of Israel. And there is [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=219.08s)]
*  really a lot of concern that this could go from a one-front war to a two-front war. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=223.56s)]
*  And now with this hospital bombing that took place, tensions are even higher. So what does [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=229.72s)]
*  that mean for the future of this conflict? I think, again, just to go back to the heart [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=235.88s)]
*  of the matter, obviously, peace between the Palestinians, the innocent Palestinians in [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=242.44s)]
*  Gaza, and frankly, the Israeli government has been put on hold for an indefinite [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=247.48s)]
*  period, probably for years. But the real message is to tell Iran, don't you think about it, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=252.84s)]
*  because if Iran gets into this—and we've got two carrier battle groups in that region right now. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=257.96s)]
*  As you know, part of my past life was Navy intelligence. Iran needs to take a step back. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=263.16s)]
*  Iran has obviously got big components in Iraq. They've got components in Syria. They've got [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=267.88s)]
*  components all over the region, and frankly, all over the world. And I think Biden's message, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=272.68s)]
*  part of the don't escalate message, is a direct statement to Iran to back off, sit down, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=277.24s)]
*  and don't continue to push terrorism in this region. Sadly, his credibility isn't much, [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=282.6s)]
*  because he's the one that opened the door to $6 billion being sent to Iran, and buying hostages. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=287.64000000000004s)]
*  Once you greenlight terrorism, it's hard to turn it off. And I see this as a trip rushing to the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=295.32000000000005s)]
*  corral to shut the gates after the horses are gone. But there are horses still in there, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  and the horses are the escalation issue. So I think a direct message to Iran, saying, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  sit down and do not escalate this, and to other Arab leaders in the region saying, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=310.6s)]
*  we want peace in this region. We do not want more conflict in this region. And while we stand with [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=315.72s)]
*  Israel, we stand with Israel on the foundation that ultimately, at some point, these nations [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=320.36s)]
*  can get together and begin to resume peace. But that right now is off in the future, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=327.16s)]
*  because at this moment you've got too many people dying in Israel, and frankly, unfortunately also [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  in Gaza. And my greatest fear is that innocents all over the region will die at a time when, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=336.44s)]
*  if we can just, saner heads can prevail, maybe we can prevent that from happening. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=343.96s)]
*  Robert, you said at the top that diplomacy under these circumstances is hard, and that is [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=348.68s)]
*  obvious in the current situation that we face. But in light of the fact that that U.S. Embassy [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=353.15999999999997s)]
*  fire in the general compound area is burning, as a former Assistant Secretary of State, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=360.2s)]
*  should we evacuate all embassy personnel, not just in Lebanon, but throughout the region? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=366.12s)]
*  Well, I think we have to take lessons from the past. We do know what has happened at the [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=372.52s)]
*  Egyptian embassy. We know what happened at Benghazi. If there are security requests by [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=376.2s)]
*  these consulates and by these embassies, they need to be immediately honored. I don't think [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=381.16s)]
*  there's any postponing the reality of security threats. But on the other hand, the United States, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=386.2s)]
*  and I give—you know, I was not a Foreign Service officer. I was a naval intelligence officer [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=390.84000000000003s)]
*  and an Assistant Secretary of State. I tip my hat to the Foreign Service personnel all over the [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=396.28000000000003s)]
*  world today, because quite frankly, they are in harm's way just as much very often as those in [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=401.72s)]
*  direct combat in a war zone. And now, as the region becomes more of a war zone, I think we really do [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=407.08s)]
*  have to also stand our ground. So it's always a balancing act, Todd. It's an embassy by embassy, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=413.08s)]
*  consulate by consulate decision. But I also think that part of that happens at the top end, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=418.28s)]
*  where you do finally get sit-down meetings with the leaders who can help calm the situation with [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=424.11999999999995s)]
*  you. A unified front pushing toward de-escalation would be useful in this moment, and recognizing [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=430.52s)]
*  the difference between terrorist groups—and the three that I mentioned, plus Hezbollah, who are all [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=437.08s)]
*  underwritten by Iran—and the innocents. And there are a lot of innocent Palestinians, too. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=441.96s)]
*  And it's the greatest sadness of war, whether you're talking World War II or this conflict, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=447.4s)]
*  is that civilians who would never want to go to war, who just want a secure life, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=452.44s)]
*  often pay the ultimate price. Robert, we can also broaden this conflict out to other parts of the [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=457.08s)]
*  world. A senior Hamas official recently said that Russia is sympathetic to Hamas and likes this war [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=462.2s)]
*  because it complicates the USAID for Ukraine. And that comment is important, because Putin is now [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=468.59999999999997s)]
*  in China, hoping to strengthen his relationship with Xi Jinping. So Putin supports this Iranian-backed [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=474.44s)]
*  invasion and then goes to China. All of these bad actors are in lockstep with each other, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=480.84s)]
*  which really raises the stakes here. It does, although you make a very important point, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=486.84s)]
*  and that is that these bad actors are bad actors who are basically in—legally working against the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=492.44s)]
*  interests of Western values. Putin and Xi have issued a statement within the last 24 hours, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=499.88s)]
*  essentially throwing up their idea of an alternative order, which is essentially a [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=505.32s)]
*  communist autocratic order, very well aligned with another totalitarian regime, Iran. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=509.0s)]
*  And so I think, you know, on the one hand, it's horrifying, because when there's an opening, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=515.56s)]
*  when there's a war zone, when there's a distraction, others take action in that void or [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=519.96s)]
*  in that vacuum. And I could easily see China taking action, and maybe not even the action [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=525.8s)]
*  we expect. They might take action against another ally, something to do with a Japanese [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=529.9599999999999s)]
*  island or the Philippines, or maybe they take the Sakhalin Islands, or maybe they [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=535.0799999999999s)]
*  test Western will by taking some other protectorate or ally, piece of an ally. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=539.3199999999999s)]
*  And I think we just have to be aware—and this is where weakness always invites—weakness [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kUIM7g888fM&t=545.4799999999999s)]
