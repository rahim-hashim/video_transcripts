# Keith Kellogg: It is HUGE Biden hasn't done this yet.
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA)
*  So the U.S. and the U.K. launching more strikes against the Houthis, hitting dozens of targets [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=0.0s)]
*  in Yemen. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=10.4s)]
*  This is primarily a U.S.-led attack, however, this after the drone strike that killed three [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=11.4s)]
*  of our soldiers last week in Jordan. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=16.6s)]
*  The Iranian-backed group remains defiant, vowing to hit back even harder. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  The Biden White House walking a tightrope, as we see here on CNN Sunday. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=22.6s)]
*  The president has approached this with a straightforward principle, which is that the United States [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=29.48s)]
*  will step up and respond when our forces are attacked, and the United States also is not [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=35.18s)]
*  looking for a wider war in the Middle East. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=40.52s)]
*  Lieutenant General Keith Kellogg with us. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  General, good morning to you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=44.92s)]
*  Just, sorry, in a general sense, so to speak, have these been effective, or can you tell? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=45.92s)]
*  Yeah, Bill, thanks for having me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=51.2s)]
*  No. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=54.36s)]
*  These are punitive strikes. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=55.36s)]
*  They're not deterrent strikes. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=56.36s)]
*  There's a huge difference as the scope and style of these targets that they're hitting. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=57.44s)]
*  I mean, it looks good on television. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=62.0s)]
*  There's a lot of things blowing up, but it's not preventing the Iranians or any of the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=63.32s)]
*  proxies from continuing to prosecute the attack. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=67.24s)]
*  And there's a huge difference between those two. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=70.6s)]
*  A punitive strike is when you kind of go in and it makes you feel good. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  You blow up stuff. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=76.12s)]
*  A deterrent strike is when you go to an adversary and you put something that he values highly [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=77.12s)]
*  at risk. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=82.6s)]
*  Until you do that and you raise your level of risk, you're not going to get into deterrents. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=83.83999999999999s)]
*  So they've kind of dumbed deterrents down. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=89.47999999999999s)]
*  You want to get to a point where you say to them, stop. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  You're not going to continue to do this. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=94.96s)]
*  And the only way you do that is put something at risk in Iran. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=96.6s)]
*  And I can give you multiple targets that you can do this with. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=102.28s)]
*  You don't have to go downtown into Tehran. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=105.47999999999999s)]
*  You can go to the Karg oil facility. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=107.88s)]
*  You can look at the Bashad. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=110.08s)]
*  That's that spy ship they've got in the Red Sea. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=111.56s)]
*  You look at Fordo Nuclear Enrichment Facility. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=114.52s)]
*  There's a lot of things you can do. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=117.4s)]
*  I understand, Bill, that when you do that, you raise a level of risk and a concern about [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=119.60000000000001s)]
*  widening the war. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=124.56s)]
*  They're not. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=125.8s)]
*  What they're doing right now is they're actually widening the war. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=126.8s)]
*  They just don't understand it. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=129.24s)]
*  Wow. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=130.8s)]
*  Sorry, General, let me just stop you for a moment. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=131.8s)]
*  I apologize. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=133.56s)]
*  We'll get to Churchill's second here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=134.56s)]
*  I don't want to cut you off entirely here. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=135.56s)]
*  You don't see this group in the White House bombing Iran, do you? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=137.76s)]
*  The question keeps coming up. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=144.16s)]
*  I don't even see it on the table, do you? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=146.92s)]
*  No, Bill, they're not. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=150.32s)]
*  They're not going to go there at all. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=152.64s)]
*  And I know they're not. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=154.04s)]
*  I mean, I remind my two granddaughters when they want me to pay attention, they'll grab [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=155.04s)]
*  my cheeks real hard and say, listen to me. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=159.32s)]
*  You want to yell at them, listen to me. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=162.64s)]
*  This isn't going to go anywhere. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=164.64s)]
*  Look, going back historically, Winston Churchill called World War II the unnecessary war. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=165.72s)]
*  And the reason Churchill, the great prime minister of England, during World War II, [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=170.79999999999998s)]
*  called it that is because he said if we had taken actions, we the West, against Germany [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=175.16s)]
*  early, they wouldn't have had to fight World War II. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=179.45999999999998s)]
*  And that's kind of where we're marching to. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=182.26s)]
*  We're marching to a level of increased warfare, larger warfare, and we haven't gotten ourselves [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=184.32s)]
*  out of that box. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  And we need to, or this thing's going to go really bad on us in the future. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=190.51999999999998s)]
*  OK, Afghanistan, I'm in one of the poorest countries in the world, right? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=193.44s)]
*  I mean, we're at war there for 20 years. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=196.48s)]
*  This is what the Houthi spokesperson said. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=198.2s)]
*  And Yemen also lists as one of the poorest countries in the Arab world. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=200.6s)]
*  Our war is moral. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=204.0s)]
*  And if we had not intervened to support the oppressed in Gaza, humanity would not have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=205.12s)]
*  existed among humans. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=209.32s)]
*  The American-British aggression against Yemen will not go unanswered and we will make escalation [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=211.12s)]
*  with escalation. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=215.92s)]
*  The Saudis fought a war with the Houthis for 10 years. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=217.48s)]
*  Can we beat them? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=221.84s)]
*  Sure, they did. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=224.16s)]
*  Well, I'll tell you, one strike. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=225.16s)]
*  You go after the leader of the Houthis. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=227.11999999999998s)]
*  Al Houthi leads them. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=229.2s)]
*  He's the spiritual leader. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=230.76s)]
*  He's the military leader. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  He does it all. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=233.44s)]
*  You eliminate the leadership at the top, then they all kind of back away from it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=234.48s)]
*  The Saudis never did that. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=238.16s)]
*  We gave the Saudis support, but they were doing the same thing we're doing right now [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=239.28s)]
*  in Syria and Iraq and Yemen. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=243.39999999999998s)]
*  We're blowing up a lot of things, but we're not going to the—we're not striking at [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=246.2s)]
*  with real heart and something that they hold at risk. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=250.72s)]
*  You know, in striking and targeting, we talk about counterforce and countervalue targeting. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=253.6s)]
*  So that's what we talk about when holding things at risk, either people or facilities. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=258.96s)]
*  We're not doing either, and this is going to just continue, and I don't see an end [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=263.24s)]
*  to it. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=267.0s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=268.0s)]
*  This administration doesn't have the wherewithal and the intestinal fortitude to basically [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=269.0s)]
*  go downtown and make it end. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=274.28s)]
*  I'm not advocating you do that. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=276.08s)]
*  However, does it surprise you or bother you at all that the commander in chief has not [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=277.88s)]
*  addressed the American people on this? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=281.68s)]
*  Oh, this is huge that he hasn't done it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=283.96s)]
*  I mean, we all know better. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=287.28s)]
*  He should have been out there right away when—not only when you lose the Americans, but the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=289.0s)]
*  counterstrikes that you're conducting. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=293.12s)]
*  The fact that he hasn't gone in front of the American people and explained it to them [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=295.0s)]
*  is really wrong. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=299.04s)]
*  But look, this is a pattern, Bill. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=300.04s)]
*  This is the pattern he has set previously. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=302.12s)]
*  So it's in his DNA. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=304.56s)]
*  This is what he does. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=305.96s)]
*  And I've kind of accepted it because I said, well, that's just running true to form. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=307.18s)]
*  Other presidents have done things much, much differently. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=311.54s)]
*  I don't care if it was Reagan. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=313.86s)]
*  I don't care if it was Obama. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=315.22s)]
*  I don't care if it was Trump. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=316.22s)]
*  They just handled it totally differently than this president. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=317.54s)]
*  General, thank you for your time. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=320.22s)]
*  We'll talk later this week, okay? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=321.54s)]
*  Keith Kellogg, thanks. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vd8rKWf74vA&t=323.14s)]
