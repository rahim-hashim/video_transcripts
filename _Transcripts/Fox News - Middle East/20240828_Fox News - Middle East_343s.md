*  the president's office. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=0.0s)]
*  President Biden pushed for the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=6.84s)]
*  building of a pier to deliver [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=8.44s)]
*  aid to Gaza with great fanfare, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=10.44s)]
*  but a blistering watchdog report [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=12.64s)]
*  finds he ordered its [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=14.24s)]
*  construction despite multiple [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=15.84s)]
*  warnings within the federal [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=16.44s)]
*  government. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=16.88s)]
*  That it simply wasn't feasible. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=20.88s)]
*  Joining us now retired General [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=21.92s)]
*  Keith Kellogg, former national [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=23.48s)]
*  security adviser to Vice [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=24.72s)]
*  President Mike Pence and a Fox [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  News reporter. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=27.56s)]
*  The building was built in [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=28.56s)]
*  the early 2000s and the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=30.119999999999997s)]
*  construction of the Gaza [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=31.56s)]
*  pier is really quite something. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=32.96s)]
*  It's total cost of $230 million. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=34.96s)]
*  It was supposed to supply to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=36.96s)]
*  $500,000 for each of three [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=38.96s)]
*  months. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=40.96s)]
*  Actually, it supplied aid to [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=42.96s)]
*  $450,000 over just 20 days. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=44.96s)]
*  They had to, it wasn't working. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=46.96s)]
*  They had to take it apart. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=48.96s)]
*  What about this and the warning [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=50.96s)]
*  to President Biden that this [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=52.96s)]
*  was not really feasible? [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=54.96s)]
*  I think it's a little bit [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=57.36s)]
*  different than what we were [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=59.36s)]
*  used to. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=61.36s)]
*  We went back to 1990 with the [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=63.36s)]
*  first Gulf War when we were [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=65.36s)]
*  concerned about getting [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=67.36s)]
*  equipment into the port. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=69.36s)]
*  We said we're going to have to [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=71.36s)]
*  go over the shore and bring [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=73.36s)]
*  supplies in. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=75.36s)]
*  This is one of those things [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=77.36s)]
*  where the Army and the military [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=79.36s)]
*  is to blame a little bit. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=81.36s)]
*  They could have planned a little [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=83.36s)]
*  bit better. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=85.76s)]
*  But we're not going to have to [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=87.76s)]
*  do that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=89.76s)]
*  We're going to have to keep [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=91.76s)]
*  looking at this. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=93.76s)]
*  Things were not coordinated [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=95.76s)]
*  well. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=96.76s)]
*  We were in Desert Storm, we had [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=98.76s)]
*  a three-star general who ran [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=100.76s)]
*  those operations. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=102.76s)]
*  I think what happened to me is [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=104.76s)]
*  pretty bad coordination by [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=106.76s)]
*  everybody to include the [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=108.76s)]
*  military. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=110.76s)]
*  I don't give them any slack on [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=112.76s)]
*  that. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=115.16000000000001s)]
*  But I think it's a little bit [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=117.16000000000001s)]
*  different than what we were [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  used to. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=121.16000000000001s)]
*  We were used to Israel if [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=123.16000000000001s)]
*  Iran attacks saying we believe [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=125.16000000000001s)]
*  they are still postured and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=127.16000000000001s)]
*  poised to launch an attack [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=129.16s)]
*  should they want to do that, [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=131.16s)]
*  which is why we have that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=133.16s)]
*  enhanced force posture in the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=135.16s)]
*  region. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=137.16s)]
*  Do you see this calming down? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=139.16s)]
*  I think they are scared to [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=141.16s)]
*  come out there and say, we [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=143.56s)]
*  believe they are going to do [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=145.56s)]
*  this. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=147.56s)]
*  They have a doctrine called [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=149.56s)]
*  the he, the Israelis. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=151.56s)]
*  That is disproportionate [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=153.56s)]
*  response to something. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=155.56s)]
*  The Iranians know if they go to [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=157.56s)]
*  a certain point they are going [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=159.56s)]
*  to get hit. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=161.56s)]
*  The supreme leaders are at [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=163.56s)]
*  risk and nuclear sites are at [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=165.56s)]
*  risk. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=167.56s)]
*  I think they said let's cool the [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=169.56s)]
*  nuclear power. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=171.96s)]
*  I think they are going to do [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=173.96s)]
*  that. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=175.96s)]
*  I want to turn to a topic we [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=177.96s)]
*  covered the other day. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=179.96s)]
*  Former president Trump at [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=181.96s)]
*  Arlington national cemetery. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=183.96s)]
*  It was the three-year [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=185.96s)]
*  anniversary of the death of [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=187.96s)]
*  the service members at abbey [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=189.96s)]
*  gate. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=191.96s)]
*  Some critics of the former [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=193.96s)]
*  president said it was a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=195.96s)]
*  political move. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=197.96s)]
*  I think it was a political [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=200.36s)]
*  move. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=202.36s)]
*  You were there with the former [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=204.36s)]
*  president right there. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=206.36s)]
*  What happened? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=208.36s)]
*  I didn't see anything. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=210.36s)]
*  I was close to the president and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=212.36s)]
*  the families as well. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=214.36s)]
*  The families wanted things to be [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=216.36s)]
*  photographed. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=218.36s)]
*  They invited the president [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=220.36s)]
*  there. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=222.36s)]
*  I think Kamala Harris missed a [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=224.36s)]
*  huge opportunity. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=226.36s)]
*  I think the president went to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=228.76000000000002s)]
*  the dignified transfers. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  This is honoring the families. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  I think they are taking the eye [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=234.76000000000002s)]
*  off the ball on a dust-up which [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  nobody really saw. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=238.76000000000002s)]
*  The families wanted these [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=240.76000000000002s)]
*  photographs. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=242.76000000000002s)]
*  The president laid when he went [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  to area 60 where the Afghan and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=246.76000000000002s)]
*  Iraq war veterans are buried. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=248.76000000000002s)]
*  The families wanted pictures [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=250.76000000000002s)]
*  around the headstones and the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=252.76000000000002s)]
*  grave sites. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=254.76000000000002s)]
*  The family was there. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=257.15999999999997s)]

*  The family was there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=261.15999999999997s)]
*  They had a facetime call with a [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=263.15999999999997s)]
*  young soldier that had been [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=265.15999999999997s)]
*  killed as well. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=267.15999999999997s)]
*  The family is like that. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=269.15999999999997s)]
*  This is distracting from what [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FEFThq86CXw&t=271.15999999999997s)]
