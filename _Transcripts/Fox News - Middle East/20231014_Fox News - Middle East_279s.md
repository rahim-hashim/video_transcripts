# Retired general warns we're in a second Cold War
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA)
*  Retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General Robert Spalding joins us now. General, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=0.0s)]
*  thanks for being here. You're the author of a book that was called War Without [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=4.92s)]
*  Rules. They're about to go to war. What does it look like on the Israeli side as [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=8.06s)]
*  you look at all the facts at hand right now? Well, I think a lot of people are [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=12.540000000000001s)]
*  focused on this attack on Gaza. That's definitely warranted, but I think what [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  we have to expect is this is just a continuation of the war that started [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=23.94s)]
*  when Russia invaded Ukraine. We are going to see a wider conflict spread. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=30.42s)]
*  Iran really wanted this so they can create anger in the Middle East and [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=35.38s)]
*  spark a wider regional war. And then I think you're going to see next is going [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=40.02s)]
*  to be something going on in Asia. We're in the second Cold War. So you believe [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=44.02s)]
*  regardless of Israeli actions, there'll be another front in the north from [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=48.980000000000004s)]
*  Hezbollah and Iran wants that and they want a wider conflict and then [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=53.14s)]
*  opportunities for other countries. Well, I don't even think it's going to stop [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=56.980000000000004s)]
*  with an attack from Hezbollah. I think that, you know, Iran wants to spark a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=61.260000000000005s)]
*  wider regional war. And of course, I think China benefits from this because [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=66.5s)]
*  they're supporting both Russia and Iran and North Korea. So this is something [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=71.38s)]
*  that I think we have to get, you know, be expecting to expand [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=75.14s)]
*  beyond not just the Middle East but into Asia as well. Do you think it's [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=80.82000000000001s)]
*  inevitable that this expands or is there a way in which Israel and or the United [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=85.94s)]
*  States could prevent that from happening while also exacting the justice [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=90.58s)]
*  necessary for what happened? Yeah, so the first Cold War lasted several [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=94.10000000000001s)]
*  decades. I think we're just in the beginning stages of it. So yes, it's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=99.7s)]
*  going to spread and where it spreads, I think really depends on, you know, China's [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=103.14s)]
*  strategy. And I really I can't tell you, but I do see that this is that's going [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=108.82s)]
*  to grow. So this ground, this eminent ground invasion, which our audience is [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=113.3s)]
*  looking at right now, is there a manner in which it would be conducted that [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=117.94s)]
*  would change the outcome you're talking about as Israel looks at entering into [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=121.97999999999999s)]
*  the Gaza Strip? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=126.1s)]
*  Well, I think what what the Palestinians are going to be focused on is creating [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=128.82s)]
*  as much anger about the attack. So they want to get civilians killed. They want [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=135.18s)]
*  to use them as shields and then they're going to use that as propaganda to spark [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=141.58s)]
*  a wider regional war. That's that's essentially what they're trying to do. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=145.66s)]
*  So if you were overseeing what's going on in Gaza, what would your what would [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=150.14000000000001s)]
*  your directive be? What would your strategy be or or implement as you look [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=154.06s)]
*  to implement? And what would your advice be to the Israelis? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=159.54000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think first of all, you have to really shut down any communications [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=162.42s)]
*  coming out of there. You're going to have to expect that these videos are going to [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=166.1s)]
*  get out and they're going to be used for this. And I think it really starts to, you [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=169.14s)]
*  know, focus the attention on the platforms that this information is spread [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=173.54s)]
*  up on and understanding that it's propaganda. If you look at what Russia and [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=179.18s)]
*  China are putting out, for example, there's a great cartoon they just put out [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=183.66s)]
*  that shows the Western media basically portraying the Palestinians as the bad [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=187.98000000000002s)]
*  guys when in reality it's Israelis. So this is about propaganda. And so this is [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=194.46s)]
*  going to be a cyber war. It's going to be a digital war. It's going to be an [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=199.46s)]
*  information and psychological war. And that's what's playing out on Twitter and [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=202.18s)]
*  all the other platforms right now. And the whole thing is designed to spark [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=206.38s)]
*  anger at the West and to really say that the Western morals are bad. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=211.18s)]
*  No doubt. Real quick, General, you wrote the book War Without Rules. How do you [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=216.10000000000002s)]
*  fight an enemy that doesn't play by the rules, which we know Hamas does not? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=220.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, I think we have to start to isolate, you know, our society and those [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=226.02s)]
*  of our allies and partners away from the totalitarian regimes like Russia, China, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=230.78s)]
*  Iran and North Korea. We've integrated China into our global trading system and [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=235.18s)]
*  to our global information system. We have to start to break them out and [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=239.74s)]
*  recognize their entire goal is to undermine our society from within by [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=243.17999999999998s)]
*  changing the minds of young people. You know, 30% of young kids today get their [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=247.61999999999998s)]
*  information from TikTok. That's a propaganda machine for the Chinese [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=252.73999999999998s)]
*  Communist Party. So we have to understand that this is a different kind [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=256.5s)]
*  of war. You are exactly right. This will come down to an information war as the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=259.53999999999996s)]
*  bullets start flying. General, thank you so much for your time. Thank you. I'm [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8XCCnHMXZXA&t=264.18s)]
