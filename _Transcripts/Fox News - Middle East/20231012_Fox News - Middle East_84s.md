# Former Hamas leader calls for global 'day of jihad'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg)
*  Alexis McAdams is following that in our newsroom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=0.0s)]
*  Hi Alexis. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  Hi Dana. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  We're getting in that new video and some new information. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=4.76s)]
*  Also an alarming alert from a former leader of Hamas calling for a day of jihad on Friday [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=6.96s)]
*  telling Muslims to take to the streets across the world and protest against Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=11.8s)]
*  Also telling people of neighboring countries to join the fight against Israel. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=16.88s)]
*  Specifically Dana asking Qatar, Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, and Egypt, the people there, to stand [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=20.56s)]
*  up and fight back. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=26.32s)]
*  So the man who's saying all of this is Khalid Mashal. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=27.36s)]
*  He heads the Hamas Diaspora office. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=29.84s)]
*  He's actually in Qatar. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=32.2s)]
*  He's been posting a lot actually posting that audio and videotape just in the past few days. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=34.04s)]
*  And he's also telling people to head to the squares and the streets of the Arab and Islamic [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=39.36s)]
*  world. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  Saying we declare Friday the Friday of the flood as a day of general mobilization rather [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=44.519999999999996s)]
*  in our Arab and Islamic worlds and among the free people of the world. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  That's a statement that was coming in just a short time ago saying it's a day to rally [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=53.36s)]
*  and support and offer aid to the people and participate actively. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=57.04s)]
*  So we do see some of the areas here in New York City Dana which has such a large Jewish [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=61.24s)]
*  population the largest outside of Israel kind of trying to harden up those soft targets [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=65.4s)]
*  like some of the synagogues and we've also seen the NYPD going to be all coming in in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=70.03999999999999s)]
*  full uniform tomorrow. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=74.4s)]
*  And because of all these protests that they're calling for us we'll have to see how it all [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=76.32s)]
*  plays out here Dana. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=79.8s)]
*  There's a high level of concern about it Alexis thank you. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auKhRlaiimg&t=80.8s)]
