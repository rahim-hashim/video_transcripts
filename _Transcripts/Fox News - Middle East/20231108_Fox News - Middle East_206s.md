# Biden reportedly pushed Israel to carry out 3-day fighting 'pause'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 08, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE)
*  The Pentagon says U.S. military bases in Iraq and Syria have come under attack 40 times [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=0.0s)]
*  in the last three weeks. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=8.24s)]
*  If and when we decide to respond again in the future, we'll do it at a time and in [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  a manner of our choosing. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=17.28s)]
*  We will absolutely take the action that we need to take. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=18.48s)]
*  The president, his commander in chief, will order that action to protect our troops and [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=21.32s)]
*  facilities as he sees fit. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=25.14s)]
*  The war is still very active in Gaza. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=27.96s)]
*  Trey Yanks live on the ground in southern Israel with the very latest. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=30.32s)]
*  Trey? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=33.4s)]
*  Hey, Todd Carley. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=34.4s)]
*  Good morning. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=37.2s)]
*  The war is raging on behind me inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=38.2s)]
*  The Israeli military just released the name of another soldier who was killed in battle [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=40.8s)]
*  against Hamas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=45.400000000000006s)]
*  We understand that brings the total to 31 Israeli troops since the ground operation [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=46.68s)]
*  into Gaza began. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  I do want to just show you off in the distance here. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=52.52s)]
*  You can see Israeli forces staging just feet from the Gaza border. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=54.8s)]
*  This is an area to the northern part of the Gaza Strip where Israelis are waiting for [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=59.54s)]
*  orders to go in and support those thousands of infantry troops that are currently operating [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=64.2s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=69.24s)]
*  We do know across this area, the IDF has mobilized its entire artillery force, both here in the [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=70.72s)]
*  south and the north, for the first time since the 1973 war. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=75.84s)]
*  We also understand there are intense battles taking place near the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=81.18s)]
*  That is the location where it is expected the Israelis will find a major Hamas command [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=91.06s)]
*  center. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=96.06s)]
*  Local media is reporting that those forces are within half a mile of the Al-Shifa hospital. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=97.06s)]
*  It does come as the Israelis are facilitating an evacuation corridor once again today from [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=103.18s)]
*  10 to 2 p.m. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=108.94s)]
*  They're trying to get in this four-hour window as many Palestinians out of the northern part [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=110.86s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=114.62s)]
*  We showed you those images yesterday of people evacuating south, yet another indication that [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=115.62s)]
*  the Israelis are urging these civilians to leave as the fighting gets more intense. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=120.7s)]
*  We do expect to find out more today from the chief of staff about the developments on the [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=125.56s)]
*  ground and what comes next for Israel inside Gaza. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  Todd? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=132.34s)]
*  Yeah, and Trey, there's also the hostages. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=133.34s)]
*  President Biden spoke with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the phone on Monday [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=135.14s)]
*  and reportedly asked him to agree to a three-day pause to allow these hostage negotiations [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=139.1s)]
*  to play out. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=143.29999999999998s)]
*  The proposal is that Hamas would release 10 to 15 hostages and use those three days to [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=144.78s)]
*  compile a list of names and then let America and Israel know who exactly these hostages [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=149.7s)]
*  are. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=157.34s)]
*  So far, it doesn't look like Netanyahu is going to go for this idea, but what do you [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=158.34s)]
*  know about this conversation? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=161.18s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=165.14s)]
*  There are a lot of high-level talks taking place behind the scenes to get the around [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=166.14s)]
*  240 hostages out of Gaza, but the Israelis have been very clear. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=169.62s)]
*  They are bringing the fight back to Hamas inside the Strip, and so they're unwilling [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=174.62s)]
*  to have any sort of long-term pause in the fighting or a formal ceasefire with Hamas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=178.62s)]
*  The Israelis say this would just give the organization the ability to reorganize after [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=183.62s)]
*  a month of war and then ultimately be able to battle harder inside Gaza. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=187.78s)]
*  And so it's certainly not out of the realm of possibility, but publicly the Israelis, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=192.94s)]
*  including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, are saying today there will be no ceasefire [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=197.57999999999998s)]
*  with Hamas. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=201.5s)]
*  Trey Yanks, live for us on the ground in southern Israel. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=202.5s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRSAQeo4evE&t=204.5s)]
