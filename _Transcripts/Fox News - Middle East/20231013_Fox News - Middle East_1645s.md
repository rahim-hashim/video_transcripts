# Secretary Austin speaks from Israel: Hamas 'reminds me of ISIS'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA)
*  The Minister of Defense and the Secretary of Defense will now deliver statements to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=0.0s)]
*  the press, and we'll have a few questions at the end. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=3.72s)]
*  Please, Minister. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=6.5200000000000005s)]
*  U.S. Secretary of Defense, General Lloyd Austin, when you said that you stand with Israel, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=7.5200000000000005s)]
*  you showed up. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=17.240000000000002s)]
*  You stand here with us. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, you have shown us what it means to be an ally, to be a friend, to be a brother. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=22.319999999999997s)]
*  The Secretary and I have just left the war room. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=35.879999999999995s)]
*  We said what decisions are made on Israeli security on our most sensitive interests. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=40.4s)]
*  I briefed the Secretary on strategic developments in our region, and the Chief of Staff, together [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=50.48s)]
*  with the IDF leadership, shared our operations. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=58.72s)]
*  Defense cooperation and U.S. support in the Pentagon, in the White House, in the Congress, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=67.36s)]
*  ensure freedom of operation and enforce our capabilities. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=76.6s)]
*  In fact, today, we will receive the second aircraft carrying essential munitions to the IDF. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=82.39999999999999s)]
*  U.S. deployment of assets on land, in air, and at sea sends a strong message to both [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=92.6s)]
*  our partners and enemies in the region. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=109.0s)]
*  On behalf of Israel's defense establishment and on behalf of our citizens, Mr. Secretary, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=113.8s)]
*  thank you very much. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=122.28s)]
*  Let me remind you all, our audience, who is the enemy? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=126.28s)]
*  Our neighbors is Hamas, the ISIS of Gaza, an organization enjoying the Iranian payroll. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=132.28s)]
*  I cannot let the world forget the brutal attacks Hamas terrorists conduct against Israeli children, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=143.28s)]
*  Israeli women, Israeli elderly, and entire families. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=153.28s)]
*  Murder, rape, kidnapping, this is what we face in this war. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=160.28s)]
*  This is a war on the existence of Israel as a prosperous state, as a democratic state, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=169.28s)]
*  as the homeland of the Jewish people. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=180.28s)]
*  This is a war on freedom and on our common values, and we are on the front line. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=184.28s)]
*  We will keep fighting and we will win this war. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=195.28s)]
*  We will prevail. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=201.28s)]
*  With your permission, Mr. Secretary, I'll say a few words in Hebrew. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=204.28s)]
*  From now on, Israel is at war. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=208.28s)]
*  We are fighting for our home, for our future. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=215.28s)]
*  In the meeting we just finished, my friends, the defense secretary, Austin, and I, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=220.28s)]
*  in the command center, agreed on a series of procedures and strategic issues. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=226.28s)]
*  I am certain that both our friends in the world and our enemies in all sectors understand [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=235.28s)]
*  the meaning of this United States and this meeting. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=244.28s)]
*  The State of Israel is a strong state, a state that is in a combination of a sovereign army [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=249.28s)]
*  and a civil society with an unusual national presence. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=257.28s)]
*  Our conflict, which we find through the DNA of each Jew, is the result of thousands [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=264.28s)]
*  of years of grinding war, with only one result that does not change. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=273.28s)]
*  Our enemies want us даo orchestrate ourselves time and time again★ [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=277.28s)]
*  and at the end of the day, we win, we 130 Styles and they disappear. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=284.28s)]
*  This is how Hamas will be this time. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=288.28s)]
*  This is the cause that awaits Hamas, the ISIS of Gaza. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=292.28s)]
*  The war will be long, hard and expensive, but we will win. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=298.28s)]
*  We have already begun, in addition to the military operations, [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=306.28s)]
*  to repair the damaged places, and they will be completed. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=312.28s)]
*  My friend, General Austin, we have now returned from the mission in the command center. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=318.28s)]
*  You have been able to do it in the field of defense. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=324.28s)]
*  We have suffered a very hard battle. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=328.28s)]
*  We will investigate and prepare for the attacks. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=331.28s)]
*  We will be stronger. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=334.28s)]
*  But now, during the war, the only and primary goal is to win. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=337.28s)]
*  In recent days, the desert has been destroyed, and those who attacked us became attacked by us. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=345.28s)]
*  The enemy in our territory, in which the IDF fighters were deployed and prepared in advance, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=354.28s)]
*  those who were planning to reach much further from the Gaza Strip, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=361.28s)]
*  we have attacked the territory of the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=366.28s)]
*  The results will tell the world what our strength is, what our strength is, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=372.28s)]
*  and as a side we are dealing with those who are trying to kill our children, our neighbors and our wives. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=378.28s)]
*  Unfortunately, this incident also succeeded. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=386.28s)]
*  My friend General Austin, we have a joint mission. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=389.28s)]
*  The road will be long, but in the end I promise you that we will win. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=395.28s)]
*  In this war, we will win. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=403.28s)]
*  I have been here for a long time, and I have been here for a long time. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=425.28s)]
*  I have been here for a long time, and I have been here for a long time. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=430.28s)]
*  I have been here for a long time, and I have been here for a long time. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=434.28s)]
*  I have been here for a long time, and I have been here for a long time. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=438.28s)]
*  I have been here for a long time, and I have been here for a long time. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=442.28s)]
*  I have been here for a long time, and I have been here for a long time. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=446.28s)]
*  I am here to support the families of the innocent men and women who were killed by Hamas. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=450.28s)]
*  I am also here in solidarity with all the families still living the waking nightmare of not knowing the fate of their loved ones. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=456.28s)]
*  And we will continue to coordinate closely with Israel to help secure the release of the innocent men, women and children in the clutches of Hamas, including American citizens. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=465.28s)]
*  Now, Israel is a small country, a place where everybody knows everybody. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=479.28s)]
*  And in times of trial, the intimacy of your society deepens the intimacy of your grief. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=485.28s)]
*  But that's not a weakness. It is a profound strength. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=496.28s)]
*  And in times of testing, Israelis know what to do. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=502.28s)]
*  Over this awful week, we've seen Israeli hotels and homes take in those who've had to flee. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=508.28s)]
*  We've seen long lineups to donate blood. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=517.28s)]
*  We've seen WhatsApps explode with messages as people race to support neighbors in anguish. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=521.28s)]
*  Perhaps because I'm a retired general, I was especially moved by the story of a retired general named Noam T-Bone. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=531.28s)]
*  His son called him on Saturday from his home near Gaza to say that Hamas terrorists had stormed their kibbutz and were closing in. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=543.28s)]
*  And the retired general jumped into his car in Tel Aviv and raced toward the combat zone. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=553.28s)]
*  He linked up with other fighters and rescued his son, his daughter-in-law and his granddaughters. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=559.28s)]
*  And when the general arrived at their house, one of his granddaughters just said, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=567.28s)]
*  Grandpa's here. These are rays of hope in a terrible week. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=573.28s)]
*  And in times like these, sometimes the best thing that a friend can do is just to show up and to get to work. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=581.28s)]
*  Now, this is no time for neutrality or for false equivalence or for excuses for the inexcusable. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=593.28s)]
*  There is never any justification for terrorism. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=604.28s)]
*  And that's especially true after this rampage by Hamas. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=609.28s)]
*  And anyone who wants lasting peace and security for this region must condemn and isolate Hamas. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=615.28s)]
*  Hamas does not speak for the Palestinian people or their legitimate hopes for dignity, security and statehood and peace alongside Israel. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=626.28s)]
*  As a former commander of Central Command, the deliberate cruelty of Hamas vividly reminds me of ISIS. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=638.28s)]
*  Like ISIS, Hamas has nothing to offer but zealotry, bigotry and death. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=649.28s)]
*  The world has just witnessed a great evil. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=659.28s)]
*  The deadliest attacks on civilians in the history of the state of Israel and the bloodiest day in Jewish history since the end of the 20th century. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=665.28s)]
*  So make no mistake, the United States will make sure that Israel has what it needs to defend itself. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=675.28s)]
*  And Israel has a right to protect its people. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=685.28s)]
*  You know, in their many phone calls this week, President Biden has told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the United States is not going to be able to defend itself. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=691.28s)]
*  He has told Prime Minister Netanyahu that the United States would also respond swiftly and decisively to such a massive terrorist assault. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=701.28s)]
*  And the President also underscored that democracies like ours are stronger and more secure when we uphold the laws of war. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=711.28s)]
*  Terrorists like Hamas deliberately target civilians, but democracies don't. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=726.28s)]
*  This is a time for resolve and not revenge, for purpose and not panic, and for security and not surrender. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=735.28s)]
*  At President Biden's direction, we have moved urgently to respond to this crisis and to send a strong message of deterrence. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=747.28s)]
*  The USS Gerald R. Ford Carrier Strike Group is now in the region, led by the largest aircraft carrier in the world. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=757.28s)]
*  We've augmented U.S. fighter aircraft squadrons in the Middle East. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=767.28s)]
*  And the U.S. Department of Defense stands fully ready to deploy additional assets if necessary. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=772.28s)]
*  As President Biden has said, for any country, for any group or anyone thinking about trying to take advantage of this atrocity, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=782.28s)]
*  to try to widen the conflict or to spill more blood, we have just one word. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=794.28s)]
*  Don't. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=801.28s)]
*  The world is watching, and so are we. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=803.28s)]
*  And we aren't going anywhere. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=808.28s)]
*  We will remain in close contact with our valued partners across the region, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=811.28s)]
*  and security assistance from the Department of Defense is already rapidly flowing into Israel. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=816.28s)]
*  That includes munitions and air defense capabilities and other equipment and resources. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=823.28s)]
*  It also includes more interceptors for Iron Dome to save Israeli lives. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=831.28s)]
*  And we will continue to ensure that Israel has what it needs to keep itself secure. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=838.28s)]
*  Now, Hamas attacked at a time of global challenge. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=846.28s)]
*  But the United States is the most powerful country in the world, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=851.28s)]
*  and we remain fully able to project power and uphold our commitments and direct resources to multiple theaters. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=857.28s)]
*  So we will stand with Israel even as we stand with Ukraine. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=868.28s)]
*  The United States can walk and chew gum at the same time. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=875.28s)]
*  And U.S. security assistance to Israel will flow in at the speed of war. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=880.28s)]
*  As this harrowing week draws to a close and as Shabbat draws near, we stand together and we stand strong. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=887.28s)]
*  The United States has Israel's back, and that is not negotiable, and it never will be. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=901.28s)]
*  And after this terrible week, I wish you and all the people of Israel Shabbat shalom. Thank you. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=909.28s)]
*  We'll be starting with the question, starting with Alon Ben-Dawid, Channel 13. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=919.28s)]
*  Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Your presence in the Eastern Mediterranean clearly projects power, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=926.28s)]
*  but should Israel be attacked from the north, from Hezbollah and Lebanon? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=933.28s)]
*  Will you be willing to exercise your force and join the fighting? [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=937.28s)]
*  I ordered additional assets to the region to bolster deterrence. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=942.28s)]
*  And again, the message that we would send to any country or group thinking to take advantage of this situation and widen the conflict, don't. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=947.28s)]
*  I won't speculate on anything that could happen in the future. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=961.28s)]
*  I will just tell you clearly that the United States will continue to support Israel's right to defend itself. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=965.28s)]
*  Thank you. And please, a question to the Defense Minister. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=974.28s)]
*  You spoke earlier this week that the goal of the operation is to weaken Hamas. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=978.28s)]
*  What does this mean for the Israeli citizens? [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=984.28s)]
*  Can you explain to us what you intend to achieve in your military system and how it is supposed to end? [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=987.28s)]
*  What is Hamas's situation? [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=993.28s)]
*  We will destroy Hamas's regime. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=996.28s)]
*  We will destroy Hamas's military capability. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=999.28s)]
*  We will make sure that this threat does not exist within our borders. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1003.28s)]
*  It will be a threat, it will be a threat, it will be a challenge, and it will always be. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1008.28s)]

*  Mr. Secretary, thank you for this. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1229.28s)]
*  House Foreign Affairs Chair Mike McCaul said that we know that Egypt had warned Israel three days prior to that event, like something like this could happen. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1231.28s)]
*  We don't know how we missed it. We don't know how Israel missed it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1241.28s)]
*  So can you tell us what really the U.S. knew before this attack? [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1244.28s)]
*  What I can tell you is that if we had known or if we know of a pending attack against an ally, we would clearly inform that ally. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1250.28s)]
*  But what we're focused on now, Suleiman, is we're focused on making sure that Israel has what it needs to defend its sovereign territory and to protect its citizens. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1261.28s)]
*  And the minister and I spent a good bit of time talking today about what those requirements are and what we need to do to urgently meet those needs. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1272.28s)]
*  We spoke about the attack, it was a very heavy blow. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1302.28s)]
*  It's time to investigate this matter. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1310.28s)]
*  At this time, I, the general staff, the Chief of Staff, all the IDF fighters, the Shabak people, the Mossad people, the Israeli police, [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1313.28s)]
*  we are all focused on the instructions I gave, one thing, to win and to take Hamas as I have described. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1326.28s)]
*  That is what is decided. That is the directive of the Israeli government, and that is what will happen. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1336.28s)]
*  Last question from Tom, Secretary. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1343.28s)]
*  Thanks for doing this. Mr. Secretary, as you just stated, you were involved in the major effort to stop and eradicate ISIS. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1353.28s)]
*  When you talk to the minister and others and that experience courses through you, what kind of lessons learned do you feel might be helpful in this case, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1361.28s)]
*  especially dealing with that whole urban situation that you just referred to, the evacuation of civilians from Gaza, those kind of challenges, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1371.28s)]
*  what kind of ideas and thoughts do you have that you can share, please? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1381.28s)]
*  Well, thanks, Tom. I would tell you that encountering ISIS, I felt as if we were staring evil in the eye. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1388.28s)]
*  It was truly evil. And what we have seen from Hamas, it takes that evil to another level. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1399.28s)]
*  And so that is the first thing that we need to remember and consider. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1408.28s)]
*  There are a number of things that we talked about today, that there are some lessons learned that we would be more than happy to share with our allies here, [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1414.28s)]
*  in terms of operating effectively in dense urban terrain, creating safe humanitarian corridors, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1424.28s)]
*  making sure that we're thoughtful about how we shape the battle and making sure that our objectives are well defined. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1434.28s)]
*  And so we'll continue to share the lessons that we've learned over the years. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1443.28s)]
*  And of course, as the Israelis prosecute this fight, we will learn lessons from them. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1450.28s)]
*  And so I think it's this great teamwork that has served us both well over the years, and we'll continue that. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1456.28s)]
*  Mr. Minister, there's been some confusion over the 24-hour deadline that Israel announced for civilians in Gaza to move south, to evacuate and move south. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1463.28s)]
*  There was a 24-hour deadline initially reported, and then there's been reports that Israel has modified that, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1477.28s)]
*  have left it open, in other words, not sticking to 24 hours of a deadline. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1485.28s)]
*  Would you please clarify specifically, is there going to be a deadline? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1490.28s)]
*  What can you tell us about the deadline? And what will Israel do, if anything, to help civilians move? [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1495.28s)]
*  Some of the people have said, that's Hamas' problem. It's not our problem. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1501.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, I would like to remind all of us what happened less than a week ago. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1508.28s)]
*  Twelve hundred Israelis were brutally murdered, raped, burned alive. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1515.28s)]
*  Kids were tied one to the other and shot at their hands. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1524.28s)]
*  This is Hamas. This is the ISIS of Gaza. And as the Secretary said, they took evil to another level. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1529.28s)]
*  That's first issue. Second, Israel never and ever will not shoot civilians in purpose. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1539.28s)]
*  Therefore, we are asking all the civilians in Gaza City to go south of Gaza. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1550.28s)]
*  And the reason is that because we don't want to harm them. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbWfFpeRHoA&t=1558.28s)]
