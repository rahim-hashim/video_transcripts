# Navy SEALs missing after mission to seize Houthi-bound weapons
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0)
*  Two Navy SEALs still missing after being lost at sea during a mission to seize weapons heading [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=0.0s)]
*  from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=6.34s)]
*  Trey Yanks is live in Tel Aviv with the latest. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=8.44s)]
*  Trey, good morning. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=10.48s)]
*  Hey, Todd Carley, good morning. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=12.48s)]
*  We are learning more about that incident last week when, according to the U.S. military, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=14.66s)]
*  two Navy SEALs were lost at sea. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=19.44s)]
*  Now, this is according to U.S. Central Command that says the SEALs were directly involved [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=21.84s)]
*  in intercepting a weapons shipment from Iran to Houthi rebels in Yemen. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=26.919999999999998s)]
*  The American forces were swept away when trying to board an Iranian vessel that was carrying [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=31.56s)]
*  advanced conventional weapons, including missile components. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=35.96s)]
*  The United States is keeping pressure high on the Houthis, and yesterday carried out [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=39.4s)]
*  more strikes against the group in Yemen, targeting four anti-ship ballistic missiles that were [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=43.22s)]
*  about to be launched. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=48.24s)]
*  The new strikes come as Fox News has confirmed the Biden administration plans to redesignate [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=49.6s)]
*  the Houthis as a terrorist organization. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=54.44s)]
*  The move will also put economic pressure on the Iran-backed group. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=56.96s)]
*  With the United States and its allies working to keep the front with Yemen at bay, Israel [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=60.56s)]
*  is continuing to fight Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=64.6s)]
*  Yesterday, the Israelis carried out new strikes against Hezbollah, targeting military structures [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=68.48s)]
*  and weapons infrastructure. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=73.28s)]
*  The Middle East is preparing for the possibility of a much broader regional conflict, and that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=75.03999999999999s)]
*  is one reason why the Israelis are pulling some troops out of Gaza for training. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=79.72s)]
*  Todd, Carly? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=84.04s)]
*  Alright, Trey Yanks live for us in Tel Aviv. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=85.04s)]
*  Trey, thank you. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ybVpRjpncw0&t=86.72s)]
