# US deploying 3,000 more troops to Middle East amid Iran tension
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc)
*  We took action last night to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=0.0s)]
*  We did not take action to start a war. The read now for retired Air Force Lieutenant General David Deptula who joins us right now. General, can we avoid that? [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=10.0s)]
*  I believe so, Neil. I would tell you that the strike last night was measured in an appropriate response by the Trump administration to actually a series of demonstrated great restraint after 18 months worth of aggressive actions in violation of international law by the Iranians. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=19.0s)]
*  I mean, you in the audience are familiar with those. The seizing of tankers in international water, attacks on other tankers, the shoot down of an unarmed American drone, and then attacks on a sovereign ally as oil infrastructure in Saudi Arabia. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=46.0s)]
*  So what President Trump did was he set a red line, that being the loss of American lives or injuries, and when that line was crossed, he took appropriate action. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=64.0s)]
*  You know what I also wonder about, General, and with that getting into politics here with your Democrat or Republican, does that mean that those who criticize taking this guy out, who was responsible for hundreds, others have told me thousands of U.S. deaths, that you wouldn't? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=76.0s)]
*  Knowing that you had the opportunity, you knew where he was, that was like the criticism that Bill Clinton got for not taking out Osama bin Laden when he could lead as president for fear of collateral damage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=90.0s)]
*  And so he didn't, and we know obviously what happened and sued years later. So I always wonder, surely you're not advocating holding off on doing that for fear that taking out a butcher would lead to more butchery? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=101.0s)]
*  Neil, let me be candid. I am absolutely appalled at the fear that many of the, and I try to stay nonpartisan, but the fear that many on the left have been advocating to potential Iranian response that is paralyzing the understanding that we need to defend, and it is a responsibility of the president, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=115.0s)]
*  to defend American lives and interests. So the way we're going to deter Iran is not by projecting fear, but by making sure that the Iranian leadership understands that we can crush them like a bug. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=142.0s)]
*  And when they understand that, that's how deterrence to future aggression will occur. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=160.0s)]
*  Yeah, well put. General, thank you very, very much. Just need that perspective. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=168.0s)]
*  You bet. Have a great day. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=173.0s)]
*  You too. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ytSAyl7jmc&t=174.0s)]
