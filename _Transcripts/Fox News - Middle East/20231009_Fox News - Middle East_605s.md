# FOX News shows scene of Hamas massacre along highway
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug)
*  First foreign correspondent, Trey Yanks, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=0.0s)]
*  who joins us from the ground in southern Israel, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=2.44s)]
*  close to Gaza at this point. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=5.7s)]
*  Trey, good morning once again. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=7.44s)]
*  Martha, good morning. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=11.92s)]
*  Right now we are with the Israeli military [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=12.76s)]
*  along the Gaza border as they prepare for an operation [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=14.68s)]
*  into Gaza following that massacre this weekend [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=18.6s)]
*  that left more than 800 Israeli soldiers and civilians dead. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=21.6s)]
*  I'm here with Major Doron Spielman, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=26.46s)]
*  who has taken us to a location that no one has been, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=28.72s)]
*  but it really shows what happened here on Saturday morning. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=31.84s)]
*  Can you show us what we're looking at? [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=34.68s)]
*  Absolutely, Trey. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=36.56s)]
*  We are just now on a four-minute drive from the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=37.6s)]
*  We can see it in the background where this black smoke is. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=40.56s)]
*  This is the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=43.48s)]
*  The original Hamas attack happened here. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=45.32s)]
*  Hamas vehicles came through here on Saturday morning [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=47.8s)]
*  and ambushed a group of people [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=51.0s)]
*  that were driving through here, families. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=52.64s)]
*  We can see there's a Hamas car here, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  driven directly out of the Gaza Strip. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=57.2s)]
*  The militants, the terrorists, came out of this car [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=60.0s)]
*  with heavy weaponry and began firing bullets randomly [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=62.6s)]
*  at all the civilians that they could see [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=66.48s)]
*  that are through here. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=68.0s)]
*  We can see the remainders of many of the items [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=69.16s)]
*  in those cars, including kids' bags, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=72.32s)]
*  school bags right here. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=74.16s)]
*  We can see socks. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=75.68s)]
*  We can see a cooler. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=76.96000000000001s)]
*  A family was out for a picnic just over here to the side. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=77.92s)]
*  And the most stark and startling are the zip ties [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  that are on the road used by the terrorists [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=85.44000000000001s)]
*  to bind the hands of the people they took as hostages. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=88.2s)]
*  When I pointed to you Gaza, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=91.32000000000001s)]
*  it could be that that's where these men, women, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=92.64s)]
*  and children are today from this location. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=94.28s)]
*  This was a planned massacre of civilians. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=96.44000000000001s)]
*  And there are a few places that can show it better [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=99.92s)]
*  than we can see it here. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  I wanna show you the scene here [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=104.36000000000001s)]
*  and just what these civilian cars look like. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=106.04s)]
*  When Hamas fighters entered on Saturday morning, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=109.2s)]
*  they opened fire on civilians that were traveling [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=112.36s)]
*  to the southern part of Israel. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=115.47999999999999s)]
*  I wanna warn you, inside this van, it's quite bloody, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=117.19999999999999s)]
*  but it shows you just the terror and nightmare [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=120.44s)]
*  that Israeli civilians faced. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=123.8s)]
*  We have seen the bodies of militants in this area. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=126.47999999999999s)]
*  They are strewn throughout because Israelis at the time, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=130.6s)]
*  before soldiers arrived and before border police got here, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=133.88s)]
*  they had to fight off Islamic Jihad militants [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=137.35999999999999s)]
*  and Hamas militants on their own. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=141.04s)]
*  It was gut wrenching for hours. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=143.2s)]
*  In different communities, no one had any information [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=146.4s)]
*  about what was taking place. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=148.92s)]
*  The cell reception was down. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=150.8s)]
*  This was a coordinated attack to inflict terror [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=152.44s)]
*  on the civilian population. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=155.44s)]
*  Hamas was able to take over Israeli military bases. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=157.16s)]
*  They were able to push forward deeper [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=160.32s)]
*  into Israeli territory. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=162.36s)]
*  And even today, there have been infiltration attempts [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=164.12s)]
*  as Hamas fires thousands of rockets [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=167.44s)]
*  into southern and central Israel. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=169.96s)]
*  Martha. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=172.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=173.32s)]
*  You can see that car behind you [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=174.16s)]
*  that just basically drove off the road. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=175.6s)]
*  And you just try to imagine the fear and chaos [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=178.35999999999999s)]
*  that was in these people's hearts and minds [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=181.28s)]
*  as they are out and about with families. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=183.35999999999999s)]
*  And suddenly their lives are hanging in the balance [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=187.07999999999998s)]
*  and this enormous attack is underway. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=190.6s)]
*  Trait, what is your sense of what comes next [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=193.48s)]
*  in terms of the Israeli retaliation into Gaza? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=197.64s)]
*  We see sort of what you would expect to see [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=201.39999999999998s)]
*  in terms of aerial bombardment, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=203.88s)]
*  which would be the first stage. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=206.16s)]
*  And what kind of indication do we have [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=207.92s)]
*  about what comes next on the ground? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=210.23999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, Israel is about to launch a massive invasion [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=215.16s)]
*  of the Gaza Strip. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=219.0s)]
*  They will hold territory in Gaza. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=219.83999999999997s)]
*  There is no doubt about that. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=221.76s)]
*  After the slaughter of so many civilians and soldiers, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=224.28s)]
*  there's an understanding that the response will be [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=227.88s)]
*  like something that was never seen before. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=230.64s)]
*  Just the sheer terror that was inflicted on the population [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=233.48s)]
*  warrants this response, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=236.88s)]
*  according to the country's prime minister, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=239.92s)]
*  We also heard from Yoav Galant today, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=241.44s)]
*  the country's defense minister, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=243.32s)]
*  who says that he has ordered [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=245.32s)]
*  what will look like the largest Israeli operation [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=247.64s)]
*  in Israel's history when it comes to the Gaza Strip. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=251.6s)]
*  We do expect more rocket fire and Israeli response [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=254.6s)]
*  throughout the day today [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=258.36s)]
*  as the soldiers prepare along the border. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=259.36s)]
*  More than 1,000 airstrikes took place overnight. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=261.96s)]
*  300,000 reservists have been called up [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=265.24s)]
*  in the Israeli military and more are waiting in the wings. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=267.76s)]
*  It's not just Southern Israel [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=271.0s)]
*  that is worried about rocket fire now. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=272.84000000000003s)]
*  Earlier today, there were rockets fired [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=274.8s)]
*  from Southern Lebanon toward Northern Israel [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=276.4s)]
*  and additional infiltration attempts. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=279.08s)]
*  So it just paints the picture of what the Jewish state [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=281.48s)]
*  is up against right now. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=283.96s)]
*  A multi-front conflict that is expected to go on for weeks [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=285.48s)]
*  and could be very, very difficult [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=289.48s)]
*  as the Israelis work their way into Gaza. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=291.92s)]
*  Because remember, when Hamas and Islamic Jihad [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=294.24s)]
*  entered Southern Israel, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=296.76s)]
*  they killed many people in these communities [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=298.88s)]
*  along the border and at that music festival. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=301.12s)]
*  But they also took hostages alive back into the Gaza Strip [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=303.36s)]
*  as prisoners of war, dozens of soldiers and civilians. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=307.2s)]
*  They say they are holding them in the tunnels beneath Gaza. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=311.04s)]
*  Martha? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=313.88s)]
*  Yeah, Trey, one more question about that. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=314.72s)]
*  In terms of the efforts that will be made [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=316.32s)]
*  to rescue these hostages, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=319.12s)]
*  explain how complicated that is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=321.64000000000004s)]
*  given the likelihood that they're being held in areas [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=324.12s)]
*  that also are places to store Hamas weaponry [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=327.28000000000003s)]
*  and they're essentially gonna be human shields, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=333.06s)]
*  it sounds like. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=335.92s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=339.08000000000004s)]
*  Hamas claimed today that four Israeli hostages were killed [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=339.96000000000004s)]
*  in an Israeli airstrike against Gaza. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=343.6s)]
*  We have no way to independently confirm that information, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=345.8s)]
*  but it certainly serves the propaganda efforts of Hamas [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=349.48s)]
*  to scare the Israelis away from striking Gaza. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=353.40000000000003s)]
*  There's no way to tell where these civilians and soldiers [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=357.16s)]
*  were taken once they were pulled back into the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=360.04s)]
*  Remember, Gaza is 25 miles long [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=363.24s)]
*  and anywhere from three to seven miles wide. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=365.84000000000003s)]
*  There are three major cities inside Gaza. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=368.56s)]
*  These hostages and prisoners of war [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=371.24s)]
*  could be spread out throughout the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=373.52s)]
*  Some of them could be taken to the Egyptian border. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=375.96s)]
*  I mean, Gaza is a massively densely populated area. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=378.15999999999997s)]
*  There are nearly two million people that live inside Gaza. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=383.78s)]
*  There are high rise buildings, apartment buildings, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=386.96s)]
*  and it will be incredibly challenging for the Israelis [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  to first locate these hostages [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=392.84s)]
*  and the civilians and soldiers [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=395.0s)]
*  that were taken into the Gaza Strip [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=396.4s)]
*  and then try if they can to rescue them. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=399.35999999999996s)]
*  Martha? [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=401.41999999999996s)]
*  Trey, what is your sense of people [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=402.26s)]
*  who are trying to leave the country? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=404.14s)]
*  You know, we hear all of these reports [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=406.5s)]
*  of people who want to get out. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=408.26s)]
*  What is the airport like? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=410.58s)]
*  Is it possible for people to get to Bangoran [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=411.9s)]
*  and safely leave at this point? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=414.38s)]
*  We saw lines of people at the airport. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=418.58s)]
*  This video released yesterday at Bangoran Airport [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=420.21999999999997s)]
*  because the flight schedule has been delayed in many arenas [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=423.14s)]
*  and canceled in part because of the rocket fire [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=427.1s)]
*  targeting Israel's only major airport. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=429.62s)]
*  Just today, Hamas fired rockets towards central Israel [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=432.82000000000005s)]
*  and every time they do this, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=436.02000000000004s)]
*  there's another calculation that has to be made [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=437.54s)]
*  about the safety of people traveling in or out [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=439.28000000000003s)]
*  on civilian aircraft. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=441.90000000000003s)]
*  And so a number of flights have been canceled. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=443.74s)]
*  We know American carriers have stopped their flights [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=445.62s)]
*  to Israel and there are people trying to get out [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=448.36s)]
*  of the country because there's a real understanding [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=450.42s)]
*  that everyone who stays behind [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=452.90000000000003s)]
*  will play some part in this conflict. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=454.62s)]
*  If you're not a soldier and you're not one of those [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=457.21999999999997s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of people that arrived [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=458.76s)]
*  at a military base yesterday and the day before [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=461.85999999999996s)]
*  to prepare for battle against Hamas and Islamic Jihad, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=464.68s)]
*  you may be a civilian who's looking to help out [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=468.58s)]
*  and deliver food to these soldiers. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=470.79999999999995s)]
*  Other people have talked about how they're going [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=472.65999999999997s)]
*  to hospitals to volunteer. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=474.74s)]
*  Everyone in Israel is picking a role [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=476.64s)]
*  and they are serving in that role to try [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=479.78s)]
*  and help the country win what is quickly evolving [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=481.74s)]
*  into the most serious war that the Jewish state has faced. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=485.02s)]
*  Martha? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=489.02s)]
*  Absolutely, and in so many ways, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=489.86s)]
*  they have prepared for this for generations, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=491.18s)]
*  hoping that it never happens, but it is underway. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=494.48s)]
*  What is your sense, Trey, before I let you go, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=498.02s)]
*  of these rockets that are coming in from the north, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=500.38s)]
*  from Lebanon, Hezbollah rockets, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=503.86s)]
*  have they penetrated the Iron Dome [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=506.52s)]
*  and what about the ones that are also being aimed, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=508.38s)]
*  as you mentioned, to the central part of the country? [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=510.7s)]
*  Yeah, the military told me earlier that 11 out of 12 [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=516.06s)]
*  of the rockets fired this morning from southern Lebanon [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=519.26s)]
*  were intercepted and one landed in an open area. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=521.66s)]
*  In addition to that rocket fire, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=524.9399999999999s)]
*  there were infiltration attempts in northern Israel. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=526.26s)]
*  Southern Lebanon saw a number of what appeared [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=530.46s)]
*  to be Palestinian militants in Lebanon [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=533.28s)]
*  cross into the country. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=535.9399999999999s)]
*  I wanna show you here though, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=538.58s)]
*  these jeeps of soldiers coming back, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=540.46s)]
*  these are the soldiers that were engaging Hamas [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=543.14s)]
*  as they tried to infiltrate this morning into Israel. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  Remember, the Gaza Strip is just down this road. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=551.5400000000001s)]
*  We are right on the border between Israel and Gaza, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=554.3000000000001s)]
*  and the towns that we've been reporting from [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=557.6800000000001s)]
*  have also seen infiltration attempts overnight [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=559.5s)]
*  and this morning. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=562.1s)]
*  So it's a similar situation in the north. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=562.94s)]
*  It's not as intense yet, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=564.98s)]
*  but Israel must brace for the possibility [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=566.5s)]
*  that Lebanese militants get involved in this fight [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=569.18s)]
*  and that Hezbollah starts to fire [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=572.54s)]
*  more advanced missiles toward Israel. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=574.16s)]
*  All right, Trey, thank you so much [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=576.06s)]
*  for your just excellent reporting [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=578.06s)]
*  over the course of the last couple of days [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=581.58s)]
*  and we're watching very closely. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=583.54s)]
*  And obviously we want you to take care and be well [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=586.34s)]
*  and we'll talk to you soon. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=590.02s)]
*  Trey, thank you very much. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r_nWmemwoug&t=591.46s)]
