# Kinzinger on Soleimani intel: 'Most revealing classified brief'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 08, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM)
*  And the Fox News alert on classified Capitol Hill briefings on Iran. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=0.0s)]
*  Senators set to hear from the president's defense and intel teams minutes from now, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=5.36s)]
*  but the House just wrapped up that briefing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=9.78s)]
*  Congressman Adam Kinzinger, a Republican from Illinois who sits on the House Foreign Affairs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=12.88s)]
*  Committee was there and he joins me now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=16.68s)]
*  Congressman, welcome to you. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=19.0s)]
*  Tell us what you heard in the meeting. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=20.42s)]
*  Are you satisfied with what you heard and do you still believe the killing of Soleimani [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=22.78s)]
*  was justified? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=27.240000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, listen, in 10 years of being here, that was, it was the most revealing classified [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=28.479999999999997s)]
*  brief I think we've had in a large setting like that in terms of what they revealed. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=32.96s)]
*  What's amazing to me, actually one of my biggest annoyances is as the Democrats came up to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=36.92s)]
*  talk about it, they just couldn't take yes or no, whatever it is, for an answer because [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=40.96s)]
*  I think they had invested in their position on this strike before even knowing the intelligence [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=45.12s)]
*  and therefore could not be convinced. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  There was a lot of information revealed obviously which I can't talk about, but I will tell [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=53.0s)]
*  you though, I am convinced even more than ever and I was fully convinced that this was [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=57.559999999999995s)]
*  the right move to save American lives on an imminent basis and they did the right thing. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=61.4s)]
*  And go back if you would, former Congressman, for a second, you said the Democrats came [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=67.44s)]
*  up and they just couldn't take yes or no. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=70.64s)]
*  What was their objection to what they were being told? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=73.0s)]
*  I know you can't get into the intel, but specifically what was their big objection? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=76.48s)]
*  Well there's a couple things, like the legal authorization for the President to kill Soleimani [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=80.68s)]
*  in Iraq. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=84.68s)]
*  It's very clear, it's justified by both status of forces agreement, article 2 of the Constitution [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  and the AUMF. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  They didn't want to accept that. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=91.92s)]
*  And then actually the depth of the intel. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=93.44000000000001s)]
*  I mean look, there's a lot of stuff that was revealed that I thought they actually went [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=96.04s)]
*  beyond what they would have normally and they just couldn't accept it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=100.28s)]
*  They still could not accept the imminence of the attack. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=103.48s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, it's really frightening that this became political so quickly and [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=106.08000000000001s)]
*  I hope that changes. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=111.60000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and your colleague Hakeem Jeffries called this cowboy diplomacy. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=112.6s)]
*  I want you to listen to this and then respond if you would. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=116.28s)]
*  This moment of great tension and conflict in the world, in the Middle East, in Iraq, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=120.6s)]
*  with U.S. troops and Americans in harm's way, unnecessarily. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  Cowboy diplomacy did not work in Vietnam. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=133.28s)]
*  Cowboy diplomacy did not work in Iraq. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=139.6s)]
*  Cowboy diplomacy will not work in Iran. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=144.88s)]
*  Your thoughts on that, Congressman? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=149.68s)]
*  Well whatever is happening, it's not cowboy diplomacy and it's certainly better than the [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=151.51999999999998s)]
*  surrender diplomacy we've seen from the last administration that really we'd already be [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=154.92s)]
*  almost out of this Iran deal. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=158.56s)]
*  We'd be halfway through it. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=160.2s)]
*  This is an administration that's standing up to defend the American people. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=162.24s)]
*  I was critical when the president didn't respond to the drone strike and the Saudi strike, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=164.79999999999998s)]
*  he made it clear what his red line was and he enforced it. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=169.52s)]
*  And he enforced it not against 100 soldiers but against the man that did it. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=172.12s)]
*  And so this was the right move. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=176.52s)]
*  And if you walk out of that briefing, if you want to withdraw the troops from all over, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=177.76000000000002s)]
*  that's a legitimate position. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=180.72s)]
*  But if you walk in there saying you're unconvinced of the necessity of this, then I think you [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=182.64000000000001s)]
*  are unwilling to listen. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=186.28s)]
*  And bring up a good point, Congressman, because when you disagreed with the president for [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=187.44s)]
*  not going after Iran for that drone strike, and I want to put this on the screen, you [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=191.22s)]
*  said this and I'm quoting here, the Iranian regime took a diplomatic issue over sanctions [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=194.44s)]
*  and nuclear arsenal and responded with military actions. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=199.16s)]
*  They felt the pressures and lashed out. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=202.24s)]
*  And it's time the United States show Iran that their dangerous games will not be tolerated [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=204.96s)]
*  any longer. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=209.64s)]
*  And the question now becomes, did that restraint, Congressman, give the president today a little [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=210.64s)]
*  more capital to work with? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=216.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think in hindsight it did. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=218.44s)]
*  I think, you know, if anybody says that he's running cowboy diplomacy, as we just heard, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=220.32s)]
*  I mean, all you have to do is look at the restraint on those attacks. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=224.88s)]
*  And people like me saying it was the time. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=227.64s)]
*  And then the president did enforce his red line. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=229.92s)]
*  I think, you know, we'll tell if deterrence has been restored, but it certainly is going [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=232.07999999999998s)]
*  to make the Iranian regime think twice again about doing this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=236.88s)]
*  And again, we didn't kill 100 people operating in a surface-to-air missile battery. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=239.79999999999998s)]
*  We killed the guy himself in Iraq. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=243.35999999999999s)]
*  And I got to go, Congressman, but I want your thoughts. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=245.29999999999998s)]
*  The missiles are raining down last night. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=247.17999999999998s)]
*  You were thinking at the time, bad, very bad? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=249.16s)]
*  Yeah, look, it was, you know, I've been under a base attack in Iraq. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=252.83999999999997s)]
*  This is obviously even bigger missiles. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=257.32000000000005s)]
*  Obviously a lot of prayer, a lot of thinking this was going to be bigger than it was. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=259.32000000000005s)]
*  I think the intention of Iran may be different than what we think, but they failed in a number [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=264.48s)]
*  of ways. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=270.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think hopefully this is the end and we can walk back from this Iranian escalation. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=271.28000000000003s)]
*  We shall see. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  Adam Kinzinger, Congressman, thank you so much. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=277.04s)]
*  You bet. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9132tA0FtOM&t=280.12s)]
