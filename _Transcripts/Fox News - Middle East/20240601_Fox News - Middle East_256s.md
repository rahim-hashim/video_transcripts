# Hamas ‘positively’ views Biden’s ceasefire proposal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo)
*  Hamas says it wants to cease fire. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=0.0s)]
*  This deal is an opportunity to prove whether they really mean it. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=7.04s)]
*  Hamas needs to take the deal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=11.8s)]
*  For months, people all over the world have called for a ceasefire. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=14.48s)]
*  Joe Biden laying out a ceasefire proposal that would include an Israeli hostage deal [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=19.0s)]
*  urging Hamas to take it. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=23.240000000000002s)]
*  Hamas in a response saying, quote, it views positively the contents of President Joe Biden's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=25.8s)]
*  speech, calling the deal, quote, the result of the legendary steadfastness of our struggling [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=32.04s)]
*  people and their brave resistance. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=37.6s)]
*  Here with reaction to senior VP for research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=41.4s)]
*  Dr. Jonathan Schanzer. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=45.68s)]
*  Dr., we'll get into the policy specifics in a moment, but why does Hamas love this [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=47.68s)]
*  so much? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=53.72s)]
*  Well, quite frankly, because Hamas is going to be able to exist after this war if this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=55.68s)]
*  ceasefire is implemented. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=61.8s)]
*  Joe Biden is basically saying that it's OK that the organization that has carried out [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=64.08s)]
*  the murder of 1200 people and the kidnapping of 240 and launched a war that has devastated [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=68.6s)]
*  Gaza and brought the Middle East on the verge of a full regional war, they don't have to [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=74.8s)]
*  pay a price. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=80.6s)]
*  They will still actually survive after this if I'm reading this plan correctly, the plan [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=81.84s)]
*  that the president floated yesterday. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=90.2s)]
*  It feels like Hamas would have written this plan. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=91.2s)]
*  We'll put it up there. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=92.92s)]
*  It's still very ambiguous, but it's three phases. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=94.60000000000001s)]
*  The first is a six-week ceasefire, which is what the left and what Hamas really, really [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=97.96000000000001s)]
*  want. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=101.96000000000001s)]
*  And again, there's hostages, and that's very important. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  But then phase two is permanently in the hostilities based on what? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=105.76s)]
*  Based on the destruction of Hamas? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=108.86s)]
*  Certainly not. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=110.12s)]
*  And then major reconstruction, and Israel leaves completely handing it back over to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=111.28s)]
*  Hamas. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=115.44s)]
*  This looks like a survival plan, as you said, for Hamas in exchange for hostages, which [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=116.44s)]
*  is good. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=121.6s)]
*  But the progress Israel has made in large part is reason why they've gotten hostages [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=122.6s)]
*  back. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=126.6s)]
*  That's right. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=127.6s)]
*  And really, if you think about it, the Israelis are on the five-yard line right now. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=128.6s)]
*  All they have to do is to essentially finish the war in Ra'afah. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=132.12s)]
*  This is the town right on the border with Egypt. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=136.22s)]
*  It's probably about three weeks of fighting. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=139.96s)]
*  That's what the Israelis estimate right now. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=142.96s)]
*  And then the hard fighting of this war would be over. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=145.72s)]
*  And I think most of the headlines from this war would probably recede into the background. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=148.4s)]
*  There would, of course, I think, be counterinsurgency operations that the Israelis would have to [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=153.56s)]
*  continue to kind of take out the final remnants of Hamas. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=158.64s)]
*  But what it looks like right now, from my perspective, is the Biden administration is [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=162.64s)]
*  telling the Israelis not to finish this, not to get into the end zone. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=166.14s)]
*  They want the Israelis to stop right now and to allow for Hamas, for Iran, for Hezbollah. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=171.7s)]
*  You got to remember, this is an entire axis that is trained and financed and armed by [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=178.33999999999997s)]
*  the Iranians. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=184.01999999999998s)]
*  They've been waging war on multiple fronts, not just in Gaza, but also in Lebanon and [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=185.01999999999998s)]
*  the West Bank and in Iraq and Syria and Yemen. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=189.82s)]
*  No one will have to pay a price for any of this. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=193.3s)]
*  The Israelis are basically just being told, look, get your hostages back and stop fighting. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=196.3s)]
*  That does not seem like anything the Israelis are going to buy. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=202.02s)]
*  Proposals like this are why wars never end, because enemies are never defeated and therefore [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=205.22s)]
*  they continue their cause, which in Hamas's case, funded by Iran, as you point out, is [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=209.58s)]
*  the absolute eradication and destruction of Israel. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=214.26000000000002s)]
*  Real quick, this was painted by the Biden administration as something the Israelis are [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=217.34s)]
*  for. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=220.54000000000002s)]
*  We only have about 30 seconds. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=221.54000000000002s)]
*  Do you think Israelis really want this deal? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  No, I mean, we're seeing Israeli politicians across the political spectrum, left, right [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=224.57999999999998s)]
*  and center, are panning this thing. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=229.54s)]
*  I think they appreciate the effort, but they do not appreciate the specifics. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=231.57999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, it's good. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=235.42s)]
*  You got to kill every last one of Hamas and then you can figure out what happens next. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=236.42s)]
*  Dr. Jonathan Chanser, thank you for your time. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdyyzeXbaxo&t=240.85999999999999s)]
