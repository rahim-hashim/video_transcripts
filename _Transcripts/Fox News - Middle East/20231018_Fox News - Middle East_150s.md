**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY)
*  So far, five shipments of U.S.-made weapons have arrived in Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=0.0s)]
*  More are on the way. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=7.04s)]
*  Munitions, interceptors are landing in the country by the plane load. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=8.56s)]
*  The U.S. is giving Israel free rein on how to deploy these weapons, unlike the ground [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=11.84s)]
*  scenario inside Ukraine. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=17.2s)]
*  Senior National Correspondent Rich Edson joins us from the Pentagon with the details. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=19.0s)]
*  Hi, Rich. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=22.36s)]
*  RICH EDSON, Senior National Correspondent, U.S. Army Command, Pentagon Press Conference [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=23.36s)]
*  Center, Israel. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=24.36s)]
*  Good morning, Jillian. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=25.36s)]
*  And that aspect is to help the Israeli war effort. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=26.36s)]
*  There's also another aspect to all of this, and that is aircraft carriers, warplanes, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=27.759999999999998s)]
*  U.S. troops all headed to the Middle East, all with a message to Iran-backed militias [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=32.48s)]
*  not to expand this conflict. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=37.0s)]
*  We do have some news on that, though. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=39.48s)]
*  In Iraq, overnight, U.S. officials confirmed to FOX News that overnight the military intercepted [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=41.519999999999996s)]
*  one-way kamikaze drones targeting Al-Assad Air Base in Iraq, which hosts U.S. troops. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=47.56s)]
*  Officials declined to say which group they suspect launched the drones or how close to [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=53.96s)]
*  the base they got. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=57.32s)]
*  Officials say the U.S. has about 2,500 troops in Iraq. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=58.92s)]
*  Iran-backed militias have attacked Al-Assad before. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=62.76s)]
*  The Pentagon says American weapons are arriving in Israel on a near daily basis now and that [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=65.8s)]
*  Pentagon is working as quickly as it can to fulfill Israeli requests. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=70.8s)]
*  The Defense Department is defending these military aid packages and giving Israel the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=75.2s)]
*  ability to use American weapons with a wide latitude. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=78.92s)]
*  We did not put any preconditions on Israel when it comes to using our security assistance. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=83.8s)]
*  Governments like us, our democracies, is what separates us ourselves from Hamas. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=89.16s)]
*  We certainly expect Israel, as with any ally or partner, to uphold the law of war. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=93.44s)]
*  The Defense Department says the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit and its 2,000 Marines [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=99.84s)]
*  and sailors is moving closer to Israel through the Red Sea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=104.56s)]
*  The Pentagon says the unit is equipped to execute amphibious missions, respond to crises, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=107.96s)]
*  and engage in limited contingency operations. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=113.04s)]
*  Though officials say this unit does not yet have orders, the president or defense secretary [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=115.68s)]
*  can change that. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=120.24000000000001s)]
*  The Pentagon also says it's giving about 2,000 troops the order to prepare to move [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=121.68s)]
*  out 24 hours notice. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  That order has not yet been given, but it allows the administration some latitude there [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=128.42000000000002s)]
*  if it feels like it has to boost the American presence in the region. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=133.16s)]
*  Back to you, Julian. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=136.88s)]
*  All right, we're Judson at the Pentagon for us. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQohz2t1WdY&t=137.88s)]
