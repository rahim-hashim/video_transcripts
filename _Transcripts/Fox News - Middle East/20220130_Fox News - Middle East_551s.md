# John Ratcliffe examines US-Russia standoff over Ukraine
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 30, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM)
*  This week, Germany has not only refused to provide Ukraine with anti armor and anti aircraft [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=0.0s)]
*  weapons, they're actually blocking other NATO countries from providing those weapons to [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=7.88s)]
*  Ukraine. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=12.88s)]
*  This is in part because Germany is now so dependent on Russian gas. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=13.88s)]
*  That was Arkansas Senator Tom Cotton on this program last week on Germany's reliance on [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=20.04s)]
*  Russian gas after the Biden administration allowed the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline to [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=24.04s)]
*  flow into Germany last year. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=28.38s)]
*  My next guest tried to stop Germany from aligning with Russia throughout his time in the Trump [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=30.38s)]
*  administration. Former director of intelligence John Ratcliffe joins me now to assess the [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=34.7s)]
*  U.S.-Russia standoff over a potential invasion of Ukraine. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=38.7s)]
*  Director, it's great to see you. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=42.26s)]
*  Thanks so much for being here. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=43.620000000000005s)]
*  How do you see this and assess the Germany end of this since, you know, Biden seems to [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=45.58s)]
*  think Germany is going to go along with the U.S.? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=50.5s)]
*  Yeah, well, that just underscores what a bad strategy the Biden administration has taken [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=52.9s)]
*  with respect to the whole Russia-Ukraine crisis. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=57.94s)]
*  Look, Germany's made poor decisions as Senator Cotton talked about to essentially put Germany [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=61.900000000000006s)]
*  and the rest of Europe essentially in a hostage position with Russia with regard to the flow [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=66.82000000000001s)]
*  of energy into Europe. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=72.9s)]
*  We knew that in the Trump administration. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=75.9s)]
*  We were aware that, for instance, Angela Merkel's predecessor as the German chancellor, Gerhard [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=79.42s)]
*  Schroeder, is now the CEO of Rosneft, the largest Russian oil company. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=84.78s)]
*  So, you know, the idea that that Germany ought to be working with us in stopping Russia on [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=89.9s)]
*  these particular issues was something that we understood that, you know, although Germany is [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=97.7s)]
*  an ally, that we weren't trusting them to lead on these issues. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=102.9s)]
*  And it's why, you know, the things that you see Russia doing now weren't taking place in the [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=106.1s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=110.78s)]
*  But, you know, where we stand on this right now, you know, this whole approach by the Biden [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=112.58s)]
*  administration really underscores that we all hope that there's a good outcome. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=117.62s)]
*  But if it if it does happen, it's going to happen in spite of Joe Biden and the decisions he's [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=121.3s)]
*  making on this issue, not because of that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=126.14s)]
*  And you only need to look at the actions of the Ukrainian president. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=128.9s)]
*  And what he's had to do in the last week, within within two hours of Joe Biden's press [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=133.02s)]
*  conference on this issue, the Ukrainian president had to tweet out, there are no small [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=137.22s)]
*  incursions, there are no small nations, there are no small casualties, essentially saying, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=140.9s)]
*  don't listen to what Joe Biden is saying. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=145.58s)]
*  He followed that up a day later after Joe Biden really set off a panic saying we can't [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=148.38s)]
*  protect Americans in Kiev and calling on them to leave. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=153.38s)]
*  You know, Zelensky had to come out and say, hey, Kiev is a big country. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=157.42000000000002s)]
*  You know, Zelensky had to come out and say, hey, Kiev is safer than most U.S. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=160.42000000000002s)]
*  cities. And then even yesterday, what President Zelensky said was what many of us had [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=163.82s)]
*  been saying on shows like this, Maria, for the past month or so, which is that the time to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=170.26s)]
*  provide Ukrainian support in terms of sanctions against Russia and weaponry to Ukraine is [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=174.94s)]
*  now not after Russia invades. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=180.94s)]
*  So, you know, I think President Zelensky, you know, would would probably tell you with [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=183.82s)]
*  friends like Joe Biden who needs enemies. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=188.34s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's incredible to me that under President Biden, you've got all of our [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=191.66s)]
*  adversaries acting up. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=196.86s)]
*  I mean, there's Iran as well backing the Houthis who are striking Abu Dhabi, unbelievably. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=198.26s)]
*  Let's talk about Iran for a moment, because we've had news there over the weekend. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=204.46s)]
*  Secretary Blinken saying that the window is closing. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=209.82s)]
*  Where is this headed? [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=213.02s)]
*  Do you think that Joe Biden is going to get the U.S. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=214.45999999999998s)]
*  back into a nuclear deal? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=217.26s)]
*  And Iran, Iran, the Iranians won't even talk directly to the U.S., right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=219.14s)]
*  Right. Now, this is headed in a terrible place, Maria. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=224.5s)]
*  Look, we handed off a year ago peace in the Middle East on the heels of Abraham McCord's, in [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=228.26s)]
*  part because Russia, I mean, Iran was poor, weaker and less influential than they'd been [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=234.38s)]
*  in a long, long time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=242.62s)]
*  They were literally on the verge of bankruptcy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=244.54s)]
*  We had prosecuted their terrorist leaders to final justice like Qasseem Soleimani. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=247.62s)]
*  And now you look at what's happening in one short year, how the tables have turned, as [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=253.62s)]
*  you've talked about, the Biden administration has literally begged Iran back to the negotiating [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=259.62s)]
*  table to try and rehabilitate the failed Iranian nuclear deal. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=264.98s)]
*  And we're not even allowed to negotiate on our behalf. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=269.82000000000005s)]
*  Our two biggest adversaries, China and Russia, are negotiating with Iran. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=271.98s)]
*  And you don't need to take my word for how badly things are going. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=276.94s)]
*  Joe Biden's own team members, negotiating teams, are leaving because they've characterized [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=279.98s)]
*  the approach as too soft. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=284.78000000000003s)]
*  We're making too many concessions, things like not only giving as much as 10 billion [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=286.5s)]
*  dollars in cash to Iran, but lifting sanctions on the central bank, on the Iranian [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=292.38s)]
*  National Oil Company, on the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=298.26s)]
*  I mean, Maria, it's bad enough to negotiate with terrorists. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=302.82s)]
*  Essentially, Joe Biden's giving a blank check. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=306.3s)]
*  And and I think, unfortunately, where this is headed is the Iranians are playing us. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=309.7s)]
*  Our our biggest ally in the Middle East, Israel, is saying Iran is playing you there at [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=316.34s)]
*  breakout, trying to to finish getting to a nuclear weapon. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=322.65999999999997s)]
*  And you need to go back to the Trump maximum pressure campaign. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=326.78s)]
*  But I don't think we're going to do that in this administration. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=330.02s)]
*  And I fear that Joe Biden is going to allow Iran to become the tenth member of the Iranian [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=332.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, of the nuclear club of nations, which would be a legacy that presidents are going [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=337.09999999999997s)]
*  to have to deal with for a long, long time after Joe Biden is gone. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=343.29999999999995s)]
*  And then, John, there's China. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=347.09999999999997s)]
*  Finally, somebody confronts Joe Biden about speaking with Xi Jinping four times over [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=349.78s)]
*  the last year and not once bringing up the origins of covid-19. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=356.14s)]
*  He claims he did. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=360.82s)]
*  Let's look at this exchange right here in the last week and a half. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=362.02s)]
*  Watch. You didn't press for transparency and also whether that has anything to do with [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=365.9s)]
*  your son's involvement in an investment firm controlled by Chinese state-owned entities. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=372.18s)]
*  The answer is that we did. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=377.14s)]
*  I did raise the question of transparency. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=379.41999999999996s)]
*  I spent a lot of time with him. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=381.86s)]
*  And he the fact is that they're just not they're just not being transparent. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=383.98s)]
*  Transparency on the coronavirus origins. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=390.26s)]
*  Yes. And you did. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=393.06s)]
*  Yeah. Is there a reason your press staff was unaware of that? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=396.09999999999997s)]
*  And what did you say to the Chinese president? [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  And they weren't with me the entire time. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=402.42s)]
*  They weren't with him the entire time, John. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=406.98s)]
*  And he said, yeah, they're just not going to be transparent. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=409.42s)]
*  Why don't they just release the transcript? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=412.38s)]
*  I'm not buying that even brought it up. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=414.34s)]
*  But even if he did bring it up, what do you think about his answer there? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=415.97999999999996s)]
*  Well, none of that's good. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=420.14s)]
*  You know, does he not remember the conversation he had with President Xi if he had a three [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=421.46s)]
*  and a half hour summit? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=425.29999999999995s)]
*  I'm not sure what's worse that he did raise the issue, as he's now claiming, contrary [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=426.82s)]
*  to press reports, that he did raise the issue that the U.S. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=431.85999999999996s)]
*  intelligence community, all 18 agencies find that the lab leak at Wuhan is one of only [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=435.02s)]
*  two plausible explanations that caused the pandemic and killed a million Americans [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=441.58s)]
*  or that President Xi's response to that was, as you just heard from Joe Biden, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=448.18s)]
*  no, we're not going to cooperate. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=454.7s)]
*  You know, go pound sand, get lost. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=456.18s)]
*  You know, none of those scenarios is good. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=458.86s)]
*  You know, right now, what we do know is that our intelligence community has made [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=462.7s)]
*  assessed with confidence that the lab leak is one of only two possible explanations [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=468.42s)]
*  for this pandemic that killed a million Americans. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=474.02000000000004s)]
*  And when when when our president raises it with the leader of China and tells us that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=476.3s)]
*  his response is, hey, you know, get lost, we're not going to cooperate. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=481.5s)]
*  That tells you how they are viewing leadership in the White House, that they will do what [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nb-rPUOjmKM&t=486.06s)]
