# Iran wants to ‘buy time,’ Middle-East expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo)
*  Welcome back. America, we're here with Michael Duran, the Hudson Institute, really a top [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=0.0s)]
*  scholar in the entire Middle East. Michael Duran, I have to say, I have a lot of great [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=9.6s)]
*  faith in Benjamin Netanyahu and Donald Trump that these are the two right men at the right [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=14.44s)]
*  time to do the right thing. My concern is not so much them, but the enemy. They cheat, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=19.400000000000002s)]
*  they lie, they steal, and they're terrorists. And they kill Americans, and they kill other [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=27.88s)]
*  people, and they support people who kill Americans and kill other people. So is it possible that [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=32.76s)]
*  when it's all said and done, the Houthis will keep shooting missiles into Israel, that Hamas [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=39.72s)]
*  will survive, and Iran, if not in the next four or five years, but maybe 10 years, because they [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=43.64s)]
*  play long ball, just like the communist Chinese, that they'll have a nuclear weapon? Is all this [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=49.68s)]
*  possible? This is, unfortunately, this is where we're headed right now. And I hate to say it, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=54.52s)]
*  Mark, but American policy is driving things down that path. When Trump made the separate deal with [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=60.52s)]
*  the Houthis, by which they stopped firing on American ships, but continued to fire on Israel, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=68.88s)]
*  he left Israel alone on the battlefield against the Houthis. And now Steve Witkoff is negotiating [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=73.36s)]
*  simultaneously with the Iranians and with Hamas to come up, I think, with this interim deal, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=80.64s)]
*  which is where it's headed on the nuclear program, but also a ceasefire deal in Gaza that will leave [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=87.88s)]
*  Hamas in place. That's what the Iranians want. They want to buy time, they want to keep Hamas [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=93.8s)]
*  in place, and they want to protect their Houthi asset so that it can continue to shoot rockets [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=98.96000000000001s)]
*  at Israel. What this is going to lead to is that the United States will be the mediator on one hand, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=104.2s)]
*  and on the other hand, we'll have Iran, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey all depicting Israel as the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=110.36s)]
*  problem in the region. We have to narrow the gap between the US policy and the Israeli policy. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=116.48s)]
*  The Israeli interest and the American interest are identical in this. And as long as we show a [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=122.2s)]
*  daylight between Washington and Jerusalem, it gives the Iranians a field in which to play. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=128.96s)]
*  Let me ask you this. When it's all said and done, which may be a week or two or a month from now, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=134.96s)]
*  if the Israeli government supports or is involved in the negotiations that the US is involved in, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=139.07999999999998s)]
*  we see all these reports that there's a great division. But let's say if it turns out there [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=148.6s)]
*  isn't this great division, that in fact they're marching pretty much in lockstep. Would that make [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  you feel better? Again, we don't know what it is. Well, nice talk about it. But it seems to me if [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=161.92s)]
*  Israel has a role in signing off on some of these decisions and so forth, who knows better than [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=167.68s)]
*  Netanyahu and his government how to protect Israel and its people? I think there still is room for [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=174.16s)]
*  the US and Israel to close the gap. I don't want to be a catastrophist about this, but I think that [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=180.16s)]
*  Donald Trump and Steve Witkoff need to see that as a goal. And they have to especially see the goal [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=189.0s)]
*  of being united against Iran and all of its allies. I think this could easily happen if Donald Trump [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=198.39999999999998s)]
*  looks at the interim agreement that the Iranians are offering and says, no, this won't do it, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  and turns to Israel to say, let's work together to pressure the Iranians, then we can see a better [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=209.35999999999999s)]
*  outcome. Right now, though, the Trump policy has taken Israeli pressure on Iran off the table. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=217.16000000000003s)]
*  The Iranians feel no pressure to make concessions right now. I just feel a little bit, seeing some [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=226.64000000000001s)]
*  light there with, you know, Dermott and the others met with Witkoff and the others last week, early [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=233.4s)]
*  in the week, for a couple of days there. That to me was a very good sign. And so I'm hopeful that [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  we're working together, working very closely with them and so forth, because you're right in so many [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  ways. This is a common enemy. They're not to be trusted. They will, if they can, cheat and steal [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=250.23999999999998s)]
*  and get a nuclear weapon. They want Hamas to survive. They want the Houthis to survive, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=255.4s)]
*  and that would be an absolute, 100% disaster. I want to thank you, Michael Duran, for the things [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=259.92s)]
*  that you write, things you have the guts to say. God bless you, my friend. Thank you. We'll be right back. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6t9iv3v_qo&t=266.4s)]
