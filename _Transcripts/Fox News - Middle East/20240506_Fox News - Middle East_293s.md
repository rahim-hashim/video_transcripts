# White House: We have to negotiate with terrorists to get the hostages home
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 06, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk)
*  Thank you both. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=1.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=2.0s)]
*  We're going to go back to John Kirby. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=3.0s)]
*  He's briefing at the White House. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=4.0s)]
*  I would just say, again, without, I don't want to get ahead of operations that haven't [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=5.0s)]
*  happened. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=10.44s)]
*  I don't want to speak for the Israeli military. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=11.44s)]
*  I can just say that we don't want to see operations in and around Ra'aq that make it harder for [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  the people that are seeking refuge there and shelter to be safe and secure. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=23.88s)]
*  And we have made that case privately to the Israelis. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=28.6s)]
*  The president did it again today with the prime minister directly. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=33.52s)]
*  We certainly made it publicly. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=36.96s)]
*  We've been very, very consistent about that. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=38.28s)]
*  Thank you, Karine. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  John, noting everything that you've said about the concerns expressed by the U.S. about the [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=41.96s)]
*  risk to Palestinians in Gaza with a full-scale operation, is the U.S. still aligned with [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=48.040000000000006s)]
*  its intention to eliminate the terrorist threat posed by Hamas? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=55.28s)]
*  Of course. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=60.08s)]
*  And is there any feeling that Hamas may be trying to trick the public in some way? [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=61.800000000000004s)]
*  You heard Israeli officials commenting on this latest proposal as a trick, and there's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=70.8s)]
*  been a lot of pressure to... [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=77.24000000000001s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=79.2s)]
*  No, I'm just... [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=80.2s)]
*  Go ahead. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=81.2s)]
*  Sorry. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=82.2s)]
*  I'm listening. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=83.2s)]
*  ...there's been a lot of pressure on the administration to make sure that the needs of Palestinians [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=85.12s)]
*  are being served and that the U.S. support for Israel isn't overhanded. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=90.4s)]
*  And you had the report come out earlier today or maybe yesterday that the U.S. was potentially [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=97.12s)]
*  weighing withholding an arms shipment to Israel. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Is there any concern that Hamas was trying to capitalize on that public pressure and [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=105.68s)]
*  a trick, as Israeli officials put it? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=112.92s)]
*  I don't think there's any possible way I can answer that question unless I got between [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=116.75999999999999s)]
*  the ears of Mr. Sinwar, and that's a place I really don't want to be. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=120.28s)]
*  I think that is a great question for him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=123.56s)]
*  It's interesting. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=127.47999999999999s)]
*  I stand up here and answer questions. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=129.28s)]
*  Kareem does. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=130.92s)]
*  Matt Miller at the State Department, Pentagon colleagues, the President does. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=131.92s)]
*  Prime Minister Netanyahu does, and the IDF military spokesman does. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=135.72s)]
*  You know who hasn't answered a single question about his intentions and what games he might [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=138.64s)]
*  be playing or where he intends to take this? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  Mr. Sinwar, the head of Hamas. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=147.23999999999998s)]
*  And I think it's high time that he answers some of these questions and he come clean [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=149.2s)]
*  about what his intentions are. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=153.17999999999998s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=154.27999999999997s)]
*  All I know is we've got a response. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=155.72s)]
*  Bill Burns is looking at that response. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=157.95999999999998s)]
*  He's talking to the Israelis about it, and we'll see where this goes. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=159.51999999999998s)]
*  Hopefully, whatever's in this thing, hopefully it can lead to those hostages getting out [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=163.92s)]
*  real real soon with their families where they need to be. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=169.51999999999998s)]
*  As each day passes, their lives get further at risk. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=173.0s)]
*  So time is really of the essence here. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=177.07999999999998s)]
*  Noting your answer, is it still a good idea to try to negotiate with terrorists then? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=178.56s)]
*  It's not like we sit down pie in the sky and say, hey, today's a good day, let's negotiate [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=185.79999999999998s)]
*  with terrorists. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=191.28s)]
*  You got to negotiate with who you got to negotiate to get people back with their families. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=192.96s)]
*  So frankly, if there's a better idea to get those hostages home with their families, I [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=196.92s)]
*  think we'd love to hear them. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=201.44s)]
*  I just don't think there's another way to do it. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=202.84s)]
*  There's no other way to do it, quite frankly. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=204.8s)]
*  You got to negotiate through Qatar with Hamas to get those folks back with their families. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=206.56s)]
*  That's the hard work of diplomacy. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=212.56s)]
*  Sometimes it means you got to sit across the table from some really bad folks that you'd [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=214.44s)]
*  rather not have to talk to. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=218.36s)]
*  But they got those hostages and we want them back. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=220.2s)]
*  But the US backs Israel's intention to eliminate Hamas? [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=222.52s)]
*  Of course back there, right and responsibility to go after the Hamas threat, to eliminate [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=225.72s)]
*  that threat. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=230.44s)]
*  Now look, Jackie, I've said many times here, you're not going to eliminate an ideology [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=231.44s)]
*  through military operations. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=235.51999999999998s)]
*  But does Israel have a right and responsibility to eliminate a threat that they suffered on [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  the 7th of October? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=242.0s)]
*  A hundred percent, absolutely, they do. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=243.0s)]
*  And we've been nothing but very steadfast on that. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=244.48s)]
*  Thanks, Frank. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=248.68s)]
*  Thanks, John. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=249.68s)]
*  Speaking about a TikTok, what prompted this morning's call? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=250.68s)]
*  Right, that's John Kirby speaking to the press corps at the White House in the briefing room [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=254.0s)]
*  just after we learned that Hamas claims to have accepted a ceasefire deal put on the [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=259.8s)]
*  table by the United States and the Israelis through negotiators at Qatar. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=264.72s)]
*  No word yet on the Biden administration's response. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=269.48s)]
*  Kirby declined to provide one. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=271.96s)]
*  Sources out of Israel though are saying that this deal is unacceptable to Israel. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9_H0jXyNRk&t=273.76s)]
