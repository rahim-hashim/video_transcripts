# CIA director pushes for major Hamas hostage deal in Qatar: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M)
*  All right, Fox News Alert, as you can see right there, it is 2 o'clock in the afternoon [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=0.0s)]
*  and you're looking at Israel's southern border with Gaza. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=7.08s)]
*  Now on its sixth and final day of an extended ceasefire deal. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=11.0s)]
*  Will they continue it today? [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=14.44s)]
*  Well, CIA Director William Burns now in Qatar reportedly pushing for a major hostage deal [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=15.64s)]
*  with Hamas during a secret meeting with Israel's Mossad chief as investigators and negotiators [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=20.54s)]
*  are trying to or allegedly calling to extend it further. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=28.02s)]
*  But is this the right move? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=31.94s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former Secretary of State and CIA Director. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=32.94s)]
*  He has a very long business card. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=37.660000000000004s)]
*  Mike Pompeo joins us live. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=39.46s)]
*  Great to be with you, Steve. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=40.82s)]
*  It's good to have you as well. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=41.82s)]
*  So in a meeting like that, you got Mossad right there, you got the Qatar people, you've [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=42.82s)]
*  got Egypt. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=48.1s)]
*  What exactly does the CIA Director do? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=49.1s)]
*  So there's two things, right? [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=52.06s)]
*  I think Director Burns as data and he's bringing that to bear. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=53.260000000000005s)]
*  He's saying, hey, here's what we know, here's what we've seen. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=56.54s)]
*  I'm sure the Mossad folks and the other Israeli intelligence services sharing their picture [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=58.1s)]
*  of the battlefield and their knowledge about the whereabouts of the hostages, who's holding [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=61.94s)]
*  them, how they're being held and the best way to get them back. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=66.78s)]
*  And so the I think the reason you're seeing intel chiefs come together is they often have [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=69.58s)]
*  the best picture of the battlefield and the risks. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=73.14s)]
*  And they're trying to communicate those to policymakers. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=76.24000000000001s)]
*  When you were Secretary of State, you helped designate the Houthi rebels as a terrorist [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=78.44s)]
*  organization. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=83.94s)]
*  And now it sounds like the White House, this White House that reversed that now suddenly [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=86.16s)]
*  saying they probably are terrorists. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=90.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=92.96s)]
*  Well, we designated them as terrorists for the simple reason that they were terrorists. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=93.96s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=97.08s)]
*  It wasn't particularly complicated in that sense. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=98.08s)]
*  Look, they're an Iranian sponsored group of folks that sit in Yemen and cause enormous [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=100.16s)]
*  risks, risk to commerce. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=105.52s)]
*  They've taken ships off the sea, Israeli connected ships off the sea. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  They fire missiles into the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia almost every day. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=110.44s)]
*  And there's Americans there. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=113.96s)]
*  The risk of Americans getting killed by these terrorists is real. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=115.16s)]
*  I can't imagine why the administration literally hours after they came into office undid what [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=117.72s)]
*  I had done and said, no, these folks aren't terrorists. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=122.52s)]
*  It was counterfactual. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=124.96s)]
*  And frankly, now we can see counterproductive to their back at back at it, taking risks [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=125.96s)]
*  and killing people again. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=130.16s)]
*  Well, what is Israel in Israel and Lebanon and whatnot? [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=131.76s)]
*  What are the Houthi rebels trying to do to us? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=137.2s)]
*  It looks like they're poking us, trying to get us involved in a bigger way. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=140.5s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=144.04000000000002s)]
*  This is part of a coordinated effort by the Islamic Republic of Iran. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  These aren't independent actors. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  All of their training, all the weapons that I've just described that they're firing, those [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=150.56s)]
*  are all Iranian weapons that's provided the good graces of the Ayatollah. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  And so whether it's Hezbollah in the north in Lebanon or the militias that operate in [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=158.24s)]
*  Iraq, they're pushing Americans. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=161.64000000000001s)]
*  These 70 plus attacks now are pushing Americans. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  They're testing the United States of America to see if we have the resolve to impose costs [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=165.64000000000001s)]
*  on Iran. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=169.36s)]
*  And if we don't, Steve, it's likely that this will continue for a long time and you'll [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=170.36s)]
*  have American soldiers, sailors, airmen. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=173.24s)]
*  You'll have someone killed. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=175.32000000000002s)]
*  There are a lot of Israelis who are thankful that President Biden is squarely behind Israel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  in this. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=182.20000000000002s)]
*  But apparently there are a number of people in his own administration who are pushing [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  the pro-Palestinian side. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  And so there's this internal division at the White House, it sounds like. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=191.34s)]
*  And at the same time, you look at his demographics regarding his voters on the Democrat side. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=195.08s)]
*  It sounds like a lot of people not happy with Joe Biden right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=200.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's true. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=203.23999999999998s)]
*  I know it's true inside the State Department. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=205.07999999999998s)]
*  It is a leftist organization. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=206.92s)]
*  There would be many folks that would favor the Palestinian cause. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=209.07999999999998s)]
*  That's been long, long true. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=211.6s)]
*  It was also true at the agency a bit, the analytic team. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=212.6s)]
*  Often there was a Palestinian analytic team. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=216.83999999999997s)]
*  I never got that. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  Like we didn't have the right to that. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Excuse me, Israel or Middle Eastern team. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=220.51999999999998s)]
*  Look, I hope President Biden will just continue to do the right thing. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=223.16s)]
*  The right thing for the United States of America is to give the Israelis the space they need [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=226.39999999999998s)]
*  to go crush Hamas and to put pressure on Iran. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=230.08s)]
*  If we do that, it doesn't matter what the polls say, it doesn't matter what some bureaucrat [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=232.44000000000003s)]
*  buried in Foggy Bottom says. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=235.72s)]
*  President just ought to do the right thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  Real quickly, it sounds like, and it's a new story today, somebody, it sounds like at the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=239.4s)]
*  CIA, in a senior level, posted something on social media that appeared to be pro-Palestinian. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=244.76000000000002s)]
*  You're not supposed to take a side, are you? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=252.24s)]
*  No, especially at the agency. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=254.52s)]
*  policymakers, but no, I'm struggling for words because it is so far out of bounds, right? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=257.48s)]
*  It is so disconnected from the fundamental role that they have to post a pro-Palestinian [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=264.68s)]
*  thing or whatever it is. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=268.28000000000003s)]
*  On your side, what on earth are you doing posting on social media when you're a professional [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=269.28000000000003s)]
*  analyst at the CIA? [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=273.0s)]
*  So you would say it's a dumb thing to do? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=274.28000000000003s)]
*  Ridiculous, stupid, and I hope the agency will take care of that individual in an appropriate [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=276.52000000000004s)]
*  manner. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=281.12s)]
*  All right, very good. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=282.12s)]
*  Mike Pompeo. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=283.12s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=284.12s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=285.12s)]
*  You killed me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=phZtxV2942M&t=286.12s)]
