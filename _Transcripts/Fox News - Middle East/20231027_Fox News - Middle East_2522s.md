# Newly-minted House Speaker speaks out on key issues
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8)
*  America's brand new Speaker of the House his first interview. Mr. Speaker. How good to see you, sir [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=0.0s)]
*  Thanks, Sean. Welcome to Capitol Hill. All right two weeks ago. Did you did you think? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Have you gotten used to the word speaker yet? I haven't Sean [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=8.64s)]
*  I've been in the job about 48 hours now and it's kind of surreal to be honest [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=12.08s)]
*  I just want to say at the outset here [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=15.64s)]
*  God be with the law enforcement officers that are handling that situation in Maine our prayers have been with the families of that tragedy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=17.32s)]
*  Everyone here in the house was dialed in on that all day and it's really something so [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=23.92s)]
*  Just to address that at the front end it would be we'd be remiss if we didn't mention it. Oh [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=28.4s)]
*  Already though you're immersed in Democrats and this happens with almost every shooting incident [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=32.84s)]
*  The the media call by the left in this country. We need more gun laws. We need more legislation [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=38.6s)]
*  What's your answer to that? The end of the day? It's the problem is the human heart. It's not guns [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=45.519999999999996s)]
*  It's not the weapons at the end of the day [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=49.879999999999995s)]
*  We have to protect the right of the citizens to protect themselves [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=52.16s)]
*  And that's the Second Amendment and that's why our party sense so strongly for that [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=55.0s)]
*  I agree with the comments of your guests there. This is not the time to be talking about legislation [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=59.56s)]
*  We're in the middle of that crisis right now [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=64.04s)]
*  But I just want you to know and I want the American people to know that all the members of the house here are deeply concerned [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=66.12s)]
*  About the families involved and everyone and we pray for the law enforcement officers that are doing that hard job tonight that most people [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=71.56s)]
*  Do not have the bravery to do you talk about the human heart if somebody really wants to kill innocent people [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=76.88s)]
*  There's a lot of ways they can do it beyond using a gun [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=83.04s)]
*  I'm sure this will become a bigger issues throughout the days moving forward [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=86.92s)]
*  Is there any any specific? [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=92.28s)]
*  Gun law that you would look at or any new legislation you would look at well been on the job for 48 hours [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  We'll see I mean there'll be lots of discussion as there are after these heartbreaking tragedies, but your point is well taken [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  You know in Europe and in other places they use vehicles to mow down crowds and parades where they've done that here in the United States [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=108.64s)]
*  It it's it's not the weapon. It's the underlying problem [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=114.76s)]
*  I believe we have to address the root problems of these things and mental health [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  Obviously as in this case is a big issue [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=121.92s)]
*  And we've got to seriously address that as a society and as a government and there's lots of measures pending on that as well [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=124.28s)]
*  You got a very warm welcome from the DNC. They said you were a an anti-abortion [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=130.16s)]
*  Maga extremist Mike Johnson that was the first words welcome you well [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=135.72s)]
*  Yeah, welcome to the your new job [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=140.72s)]
*  Then they went on to say that you were the co-sponsor of instant to Institute an extreme abortion ban [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=142.76000000000002s)]
*  We'll get into detail nationwide [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=149.04000000000002s)]
*  You want to cut Social Security and Medicare and here's some free advice from Mike Johnson, and that is don't get comfortable [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=152.0s)]
*  We've been here before this is the same exact maga [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=160.32s)]
*  Extremism that the American people have already rejected and they will do it again [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=163.88s)]
*  I thought that was the warmest welcome you could ever want from the Democrat. Yeah, welcome to the job [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=168.6s)]
*  Look, they don't they don't know me a lot of these people don't know me [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=173.2s)]
*  And I think if they would talk to some of my colleagues here even on the other side of the aisle that have worked with [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=175.92s)]
*  Me for the seven years that I've been on Capitol Hill. They would tell them that those things are not true [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=181.0s)]
*  Give me a chance. Let me let me have a chance to lead here and you'll see what I'm really about. Let me ask you [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=186.0s)]
*  Because a lot of people don't know you and before I get to some really heavy-duty questions [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=192.27999999999997s)]
*  Issues of great national importance. What do you want people to know about you? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=198.51999999999998s)]
*  There were things about you that I learned in the lead-up to this interview [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=203.92s)]
*  I I didn't know that you didn't actually legally adopt a young 14 year old [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=207.48s)]
*  But you basically adopted him it would have taken four years to finalize it [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=212.92s)]
*  And he happened to be African-american and he was your first son and now you have four other children and you've got one of them [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=217.28s)]
*  this this son was named Michael your other 14 year old is Jack and [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=224.36s)]
*  You said some pretty deep profound things that you think it is harder [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=229.12s)]
*  for your [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=234.07999999999998s)]
*  African-american son than your biological son in life [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=235.8s)]
*  Are you saying that's? [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=240.72s)]
*  Institutional racism in the country what we were referring to no, it's it's a reality though having raised two 14 year old boys and in America [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=242.84s)]
*  in the state of Louisiana [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=250.2s)]
*  They had different experiences and and I'm not so sure it was all about skin color [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=252.04s)]
*  But it is about culture and society [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=257.3s)]
*  Michael the the our first [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=260.52s)]
*  Came from a really troubled background and had a lot of challenges Jack on the other hand [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=263.64s)]
*  We was raised in our household from the time he was born and it just struck me [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=267.88s)]
*  Sean that it's a reality that you know there are different [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=272.2s)]
*  There are different paths in life and people have lots of things they have to overcome and so it gives you a lot of empathy [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=275.84000000000003s)]
*  It allows you to see into the heart of people and really try to understand them better and that that [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=281.48s)]
*  that comes in handy in this arena because [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=286.72s)]
*  we're really expected to hate our [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  colleagues on the other side of the aisle and and and [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  Beat them all the time as enemies and politically speaking [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=294.88s)]
*  But you have to recognize that this is a system that was built upon disagreement [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=298.04s)]
*  I mean what the founders intended here in this legislative context is that we're gonna come to the table with very different [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=302.6s)]
*  Philosophical ideas and core principles and we have to arm wrestle over that and reach consensus [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=308.12s)]
*  To move the ball forward for the American people. That's what the system is built upon [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=313.8s)]
*  And right now people are going to their corners and they're refusing to talk. We've got to get over that. I don't know how we [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=317.12s)]
*  We [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=321.48s)]
*  reconcile a lot of these issues either believe in climate alarmism or [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=323.0s)]
*  Energy independence. How do you reconcile that? How do you reconcile? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=327.8s)]
*  defund dismantle versus [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=331.40000000000003s)]
*  Funding law enforcement and no bail laws versus bail laws. How do you reconcile secure borders or sanctuary states or cities? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=333.92s)]
*  Very controversial issues and I don't know where the middle ground is. Do you see it? [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=342.16s)]
*  There is less and less middle ground over the over the decades that the parties have grown very far apart [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=346.76s)]
*  There's a wide chasm now, you know [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=353.4s)]
*  If you're rewound back 40 or 50 years there wasn't really a lot of difference between the Republican and Democrat parties [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=355.35999999999996s)]
*  If you compared their platforms, they were nuances about policy, but they believed in the same things [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=360.84s)]
*  They were trying to do what's right for the country [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=365.24s)]
*  You know the allegation here about some of our colleagues is that's not really their agenda and some of them really would like to [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=367.44s)]
*  Trade what we have for a European style socialist form of government. We know that that is a terrible idea [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=373.64000000000004s)]
*  So we stand for our foundational principles [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=380.08000000000004s)]
*  What you have to do is get down to those core principles and and argue debate with your colleagues and use the facts [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=382.24s)]
*  You know show them the reality socialism is a dead end communism and Marxism are terrible things [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=387.92s)]
*  It's been responsible for the deaths of tens of millions of innocent people over the 20th century alone, right? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=394.24s)]
*  That is not the path we want to go down America is different and we are exceptional because we stand on certain foundational principles [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=399.59999999999997s)]
*  I said in my speech the other night that was that last night all my hours are running together now [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=406.03999999999996s)]
*  I think it was yesterday yesterday [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=410.35999999999996s)]
*  I talked about the core principles of American conservatism and that's individual freedom limited government the rule of law peace through strength fiscal [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=411.59999999999997s)]
*  Responsibility free markets and human dignity and or under each of those there would be subcategories [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=420.12s)]
*  But that's what we stand for I call them the core principles of American conservatism [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=424.35999999999996s)]
*  But it's really the core principles of America itself. We're different. We're exceptional [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=429.56s)]
*  the reason we're the freest most powerful most successful nation in the history of the world is [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=434.2s)]
*  Because that's what we stand for and those values and those principles are under assault right now [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=438.28s)]
*  And we have to defend them here every day with everything we have. Let me ask you you had a bipartisan briefing with [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=443.0s)]
*  President Biden Hakeem Jeffries were there other other leaders were there. You got a phone call from President Biden [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=449.56s)]
*  Tell us about it how'd it go [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=455.92s)]
*  Well, I actually had a visit with the president at the White House today for about 15 minutes or 15 or 20 minutes [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=457.92s)]
*  The other parties were running late. So it was he and I sitting there together. It was a meet-and-greet [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=462.6s)]
*  I'd only met him once before [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=467.72s)]
*  It was cordial and pleasant. I have no problem with with President Biden as an individual, right? You respect the office [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=469.72s)]
*  It's a biblical admonition that you give honor where honor is due and that's the the honest the respect that we have for the office [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=476.2s)]
*  But he and I [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=482.12s)]
*  Agree on almost no policy [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=484.76s)]
*  So we didn't get into that too much today Sean [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=486.6s)]
*  But there'll be time for that in the days ahead [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=488.36s)]
*  Is there any one thing you can think of policy that you would say he's done a really good job on this or that? [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=489.96000000000004s)]
*  I can't I can't I think it's been a failed presidency and all the problems some of the those that you've articulated already [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=494.76s)]
*  At the outset of the program here are were caused by policy choices. And that's the problem I have with him [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=500.88s)]
*  It's just philosophical look [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=506.08000000000004s)]
*  I'm sure [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=508.16s)]
*  If you've ever seen my show and I don't know I didn't ask you if you've ever watched it [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=510.20000000000005s)]
*  President had in my view has been struggling cognitively. It's a significant decline that I see [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=515.08s)]
*  I'm not sure if you saw the tape the interview that he gave a gaggle on [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=522.44s)]
*  Air Force one when he's flying back from Israel after by the way a lot of [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=526.72s)]
*  Allied nations did not want to meet with him leaders did not want to meet with them, which I found to be a pretty big snub [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=530.76s)]
*  I don't know if you saw that tape. Do you see in Joe Biden a [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=536.92s)]
*  Cognitive decline and if so, is that a danger to the country? I do I think most of us do that's reality [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=543.36s)]
*  It's not a personal slight to him [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=551.06s)]
*  It has to do with with age and acumen and everyone's different everyone ages differently [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=552.8s)]
*  Clearly if you look at a tape of Joe Biden making an argument in the Senate Judiciary Committee a few years ago [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=557.4s)]
*  And you see a speech that he delivers now [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=562.4s)]
*  There's a difference [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=564.52s)]
*  Again, I mean it's it's not a personal insult to him [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=565.9599999999999s)]
*  It's just reality and this is this is what's concerning to us [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=568.84s)]
*  Is that we we cannot project weakness of any kind on the world stage right now? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=571.4s)]
*  This is a dangerous time for all the things going on around the world [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=575.56s)]
*  The world is a tinderbox a strong America is good for the whole world and we have to project strength [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=578.24s)]
*  I mean Reagan used to remind us all the time [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=583.8s)]
*  It's peace through strength if America shows weakness it invites aggression by our adversaries and that's what you're seeing around the world [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=585.6s)]
*  So I think that's a really important thing to remember and also Sean also remember [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=592.72s)]
*  I've been watching your show since I can as long as I can remember all that on 25 years [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=597.0s)]
*  I love when people tell me I've been watching you since I've been in first grade [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=601.02s)]
*  I mean I remember would feel really good. I remember when your hair was dark dark. It was a lot darker by the way speaker [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=603.96s)]
*  I think you're gonna catch up pretty quick. It's already happening especially with the smaller majority. Yeah [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=609.6800000000001s)]
*  already the press the left have come at you and come at you hard [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=615.24s)]
*  Specifically I'll give you two big issues one on the issue you you once worked for the Alliance Defense Fund a Christian advocacy group [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=620.5600000000001s)]
*  and [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=629.24s)]
*  comments you had made both in writing and advocacy for this group about [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=630.5200000000001s)]
*  homosexuality calling it sinful destructive [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=635.6400000000001s)]
*  and [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=638.48s)]
*  and not supporting gay marriage [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=639.4000000000001s)]
*  Quote no clear right to sodomy in the Constitution you have been getting hammered on this [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=642.7600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and I want to ask you about it. I want to know exactly [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=648.68s)]
*  You know where you stand some of these comments were 15 years ago [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=652.3599999999999s)]
*  I don't even remember some of them [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=655.68s)]
*  I was a litigator that was called upon to defend the state marriage amendments if you remember back in the early [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=657.28s)]
*  2000s I think was over 35 states somewhere in that number that the people went to the ballot in their respective states [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=662.3599999999999s)]
*  And they amended their state constitutions to say marriage is one man one woman [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=669.04s)]
*  Well, I was a religious liberty defense lawyer and I was called to go in and defend those cases in the courts [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=672.4799999999999s)]
*  Let me let me state this very clearly and there's been questions about this [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=676.72s)]
*  Let me say where I am anybody that knows me will tell you this is true. I am a rule of law guy [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=679.8000000000001s)]
*  I made a career defending the rule of law [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=684.5600000000001s)]
*  I respect the rule of law when the Supreme Court issued the Obergefell opinion that became the law of the land [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=686.96s)]
*  Okay, I respect the rule of law, but I also genuinely love all people regardless of their lifestyle choices [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=692.12s)]
*  This is not about the people themselves. I am a Bible-believing Christian someone asked me today in the media [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=698.64s)]
*  They said it's curious people are curious. What does Mike Johnson think about any issue under the Sun? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=704.62s)]
*  I said well go pick up a Bible off your shelf and read it. That's that's my worldview. That's what I believe [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=709.98s)]
*  And so I'm a personal worldview my personal worldview [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=715.3000000000001s)]
*  But here's the thing everybody comes to the House of Representatives with deep personal convictions [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=717.7s)]
*  But all of our personal convictions are not going to become law [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=722.34s)]
*  That's this is a a big body of people as 435 members in the house [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=725.38s)]
*  You have to argue and find consensus and all of that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=730.46s)]
*  So I have no agenda other than what's best for the American people and to defend the rule of law and that's what we're doing [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=733.34s)]
*  Well, then let me ask you on the issue of abortion where you've been very pro-life [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=738.46s)]
*  Yeah, obviously that comes from your issuers faith you had argued against row [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=742.8199999999999s)]
*  Bad law. Yes, Dobbs happens. Yes that that issue now has been sent back to the states on either one of these issues [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=748.58s)]
*  gay marriage [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=756.9s)]
*  Abortion [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=758.46s)]
*  In the next 14 months as you're gonna be the Speaker of the House assuming the motion to vacate never comes up [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=759.7800000000001s)]
*  Which I think is awful not shouldn't be there [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=765.24s)]
*  I think we're gonna change or have a have a higher bar certainly 25 people instead of just any one member [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=767.4000000000001s)]
*  But on any on those two issues where they've come at you so hard and you're explaining your personal view and you're kind of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=773.46s)]
*  bifurcating it or away from your political view [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=781.1s)]
*  Do you see any scenario where either one of those issues [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=784.8199999999999s)]
*  Would be an agenda item for you and the Republicans for the next 14 months or and any point down the line [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=788.78s)]
*  When first on the marriage issue, no one has discussed that for as long as I can remember [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=795.14s)]
*  This has been settled by the Supreme Court in the Obergefell opinion in 2015. So right that's the decision now [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=798.98s)]
*  They changed the definition of marriage that had been regarded by basically every human society for 5,000 years [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=805.5s)]
*  But when five justices on the Supreme Court changed it that became the law of the land. I'm a constitutional law attorney [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=811.42s)]
*  I respect that and we move forward the abortion issue was different [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=815.74s)]
*  The table was just reset with Dobbs opinion overturned a row which I thought was one of the worst probably the worst [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=819.3399999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court opinion Roe v. Wade Roe v. Wade. Yes, the most erroneous court opinion that had been so you like it back [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=825.3s)]
*  You like the states to decide we argued my entire career for 25 years that the state should have the right to do this [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=830.62s)]
*  There's no national consensus among the people on what to do with that that issue on a federal level for certain this we have [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=835.92s)]
*  Such big priorities in this moment right now Sean. We have Israel being attacked. We have unrest [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=843.8s)]
*  We have the Ukraine situation. We've got to deal with we have China being aggressive [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=850.04s)]
*  We have Iran with all the meddling and China Russia and Iran working together [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=853.68s)]
*  This is a dangerous time. The economy is in the tank. The border is overrun people are dying from fentanyl poisoning all of these issues [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=857.68s)]
*  These are the the front-line matters that with that have our attention right now and the rest of these things [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=864.36s)]
*  They're just using for political attacks [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=869.12s)]
*  So basically you're saying these issues will not be coming up and you're going to focus on the agenda items that you have laid [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=871.12s)]
*  Out already and the ones you just mentioned which we will go into some detail with let me ask you one other question on this [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=876.92s)]
*  and this has come up as [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=882.4s)]
*  Most controversial you had authored legislation called the stop the sexualization of children act of 2022 [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=884.24s)]
*  Okay, now I look deeply into this act your critics have said or dubbed it [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=891.8s)]
*  It's a federal don't say gay measure by the way [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=897.0s)]
*  the word gay was never in the Florida legislation in fairness to Governor DeSantis and [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=900.9599999999999s)]
*  Yet this when you look at exactly what this is it would prohibit the use of federal funds to develop implement [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=906.6s)]
*  Facilitate or fund any sexually oriented program event literature for children under the age of 10 [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=913.0s)]
*  Now a lot of our kids and a lot of school districts around the country they can't read write do math science [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=919.7800000000001s)]
*  They're not learning history and they certainly need to learn computers [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=925.22s)]
*  So to the age of 10 very specifically, but you're not talking about anything beyond that [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=928.46s)]
*  No, and if you pull this anywhere in the country almost any state any community [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=935.34s)]
*  They're going to say moms and dads should be the ones responsible for talking about these sensitive issues with their children [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=940.5600000000001s)]
*  Not the public school system [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=945.94s)]
*  I mean I'll take that debate anywhere to Main Street in any town hall in any city in America [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=947.76s)]
*  I would love to put them to challenges on that because that's what the American people believe and that's what I believe [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=952.28s)]
*  Let me ask I have a lot of questions as you point out [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=956.76s)]
*  There is a lot going on in the world right now [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=960.6s)]
*  Well, let me throw some numbers at you because I think they're very important. We've got war in Europe [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=962.6s)]
*  We've got Ukraine and we got Russia [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=967.52s)]
*  And it seems very precarious there already Joe Biden has given [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=969.96s)]
*  76.8 billion dollars to Ukraine. He wants 61 billion dollars more [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=975.9200000000001s)]
*  he wants 14 billion to go to Israel and [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=981.96s)]
*  I think he and then he wants to put money on the border [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=985.96s)]
*  Probably to satisfy conservatives in the house and get their support on Ukraine [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=988.9200000000001s)]
*  For example, which seems to be his top priority a big disparity in the amount of money [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=993.48s)]
*  I have some criticisms about the issue of Ukraine number one [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=997.52s)]
*  If you're gonna fight a war you should fight it to win it [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1001.88s)]
*  I thought the president made a horrible mistake by denying Migs that were offered by Poland [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1004.3199999999999s)]
*  I think the president made a horrible mistake trying to put handcuffs on the Ukrainian army led by Zelensky [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1008.64s)]
*  On the issue of how they will fight and what weapons they can and cannot use like cluster bombs [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1014.6s)]
*  I don't like the fact that Europe doesn't pay their fair share. So they've got 78 billion. He wants another 61 billion [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1019.4399999999999s)]
*  How will you deal with the issues that he wants to tie all of these issues together? [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1027.28s)]
*  Which now gets into the budgetary process [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1031.84s)]
*  Will you go issue by issue? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1034.52s)]
*  I told the staff the White House today that our consensus among House Republicans is that we need to bifurcate those issues [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1036.16s)]
*  I agree with your assessment in Ukraine and that's why the American people are demanding some real [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1042.56s)]
*  Accountability for the use of those dollars now [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1047.2s)]
*  We can't allow Vladimir Putin to prevail in Ukraine because I don't believe it would stop there and it would probably [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1049.26s)]
*  Encourage and empower China to perhaps make a move on Taiwan. We have these concerns [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1054.56s)]
*  We're not going to abandon them [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1059.76s)]
*  But we have a responsibility of stewardship responsibility over the precious treasure of the American people [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1061.4399999999998s)]
*  We have to make sure that the White House is providing the people with some accountability for the dollars and we want to know what the objective [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1066.6399999999999s)]
*  There is what is the end game in Ukraine? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1073.54s)]
*  The White House has not provided that I was at the White House for a couple of hours today [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1075.6s)]
*  And I told the staff there that this is where we are. This is where the House Republicans are [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1079.32s)]
*  So we're gonna look at Israel's that kind of money is that America having a proxy war with Putin and Russia? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1084.36s)]
*  It's a great concern [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1089.6799999999998s)]
*  We've got a group of our colleagues here in the house led by Margaret Mike R. C out of California brilliant [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1090.78s)]
*  Legislator and a top gun pilot and some of our veterans have gotten together Dan Crenshaw is involved in this and others [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1096.3999999999999s)]
*  they came up with a document that presents 12 critical questions for the White House to answer as a [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1102.24s)]
*  Condition of our supply and the additional support. These are not hard questions Sean [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1108.1599999999999s)]
*  These are things the White House should be forthcoming about I [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1111.56s)]
*  Delivered that myself. Oh you did deliver to the I delivered it myself today and international security advisor Jake Sullivan and read it [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1114.2s)]
*  He says he's studied going to he's gonna study. Yes during the show. Yes, so [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1120.72s)]
*  We want to be cooperative [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1125.3200000000002s)]
*  We need to work together on this but we we owe it to the people to know what the plan is where the money is [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1126.96s)]
*  Going to be spent and we need some auditing for the dollars that we've already sent over there [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1131.8s)]
*  These are not tough questions, right? Israel is a separate matter. We're gonna bring forward a [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1135.02s)]
*  standalone Israel funding measure over 14 billion dollars [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1139.68s)]
*  14 billion enough that well Israel's requested a little less than that [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1143.28s)]
*  Actually, the White House did by way of Israel and 14.5 billion specifically is what we're looking at [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1147.04s)]
*  It's a very specific number tied to very specific measures [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1152.44s)]
*  But here's the important thing that distinguishes House Republicans from the other team. We're gonna find pay-fors in the budget [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1155.36s)]
*  We're not just printing money to send it overseas. We're gonna find the cuts elsewhere to do that [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1161.34s)]
*  Let me ask you this in Israel. It's very complicated [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1165.46s)]
*  I mean Syria is now firing missiles into Israel the Houthi rebels, which I don't know why Joe Biden [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1169.32s)]
*  You know, they were once designated a terrorist group. He's taken away that designation. I why I don't know [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1176.44s)]
*  They tried to fire [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1182.48s)]
*  missiles into [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1184.4s)]
*  Israel in the north you have Hezbollah and you have Lebanon in the south where Gaza killed [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1186.04s)]
*  1,400 including 30 Americans and Americans are being held hostage [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1191.92s)]
*  Beyond the money part is there any [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1196.28s)]
*  Involvement you see or any reason for any military involvement by the United States would Congress support that? [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1199.1599999999999s)]
*  because it seems like with the maneuverings of [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  Our Navy and other indications special forces maybe to rescue American hostages any movement that you would support that you can think of now [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1210.84s)]
*  It's a very delicate situation. It changes by the hour. We're watching it very closely [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  One thing that House Republicans are resolved on is that we must stand with our most important ally in the Middle East and that's Israel [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1223.48s)]
*  We will we certainly hope that it doesn't come to boots on the ground [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1230.0800000000002s)]
*  If if it comes to that and we communicated this to the White House staff as well today that you know [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1234.1200000000001s)]
*  We have the article one power in the legislative branch of government and they have article two [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1240.0s)]
*  They have very limited authority on what they can do to respond without coming to Congress to seek consent and even my Democrat colleagues [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1244.0800000000002s)]
*  Sean that are committees of jurisdiction understand this and the Foreign Affairs Committee [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1250.96s)]
*  They there's a purpose for that the reason the framers put that into the Constitution [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1255.88s)]
*  Is that they wanted a multitude of wise counsel to decide upon military intervention matters on a declaration of war they wanted the duly elected [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1259.8400000000001s)]
*  Representatives of the people to make that decision collectively and not one commander-in-chief sitting in an office here [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1267.16s)]
*  Here's my worst fear worst case scenario for the Middle East. Okay, Israel will be fighting a two-front war [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1272.68s)]
*  Yeah, Gaza Hamas in the south. Yes soon as they the ground incursion which could happen any minute begins [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1280.12s)]
*  I would expect more rockets to be fired from the north from Lebanon Hezbollah [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1286.6399999999999s)]
*  They have to they both have something in common that they're getting military strategy weaponry money support from Iran [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1292.04s)]
*  Yeah, that's the head of the snake now [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1299.12s)]
*  We have another problem Syria has involved itself in this conflict another problem the Houthi seem to be wanting to involve themselves and you've had [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1301.12s)]
*  Comments made by the leaders of Iran that they themselves may get involved in a conflict if that happens [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1309.8400000000001s)]
*  Correct me you think I'm wrong. I would bet I would say all bets are off in the Middle East [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1318.2s)]
*  we could have a full-out war in the Middle East Israel at the center of it and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1323.2s)]
*  At that point if Israel's existence is put in jeopardy. I don't think Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1328.56s)]
*  Known for almost 30 years [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1335.56s)]
*  I don't think there's anything he won't do to preserve and protect his country from people that have [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1336.96s)]
*  Committed their lives to destroy it. He has to do that and around here people throw around the phrase existential threat [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1343.08s)]
*  They have an existential threat every day [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1350.12s)]
*  I mean their neighbors want to eliminate them and wipe them off the map. So Prime Minister Netanyahu is resolved [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1351.86s)]
*  I've spent time with him personally. I know him as well [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1358.14s)]
*  I think he's a strong leader at this important time and I think he's gonna do what is necessary and [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1361.3200000000002s)]
*  America will back him up [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1366.8400000000001s)]
*  I mean they tell us when we're in Israel and you've been there [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1367.96s)]
*  They say the reason that we are able to sustain ourselves and survive is because everyone knows that our big ally is [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1371.16s)]
*  America and that's an important role that we have in the world [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1378.48s)]
*  We're not the world's policeman but a strong America as I said is good for the whole world because it's the perception [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1381.42s)]
*  That we would be there to defend freedom and that's been our role [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1387.04s)]
*  That's the Reagan doctrine a lot of our friends in our party are becoming more isolationist and understand the concerns [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1390.8s)]
*  We can't be dropping money out of helicopters all around the world because we also have a 33.5 trillion dollar federal debt [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1397.18s)]
*  I saw a sign on the way and it said 33.6. Did we go to six great probably from this afternoon exactly [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1403.1200000000001s)]
*  It goes so fast. You can't track it. That's the concern [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1408.96s)]
*  You know, we we deeply care and are concerned about all nations of free people around the world [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1411.34s)]
*  But we have to take care of our own house first [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1415.8s)]
*  And so that's also part of this delicate calculation and and the decision [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1417.8799999999999s)]
*  I I've been to Israel during a flare-up and I believe it was 2014 and at that point I I [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1422.28s)]
*  Got to see up front and go inside the terror tunnels that are built by Hamas [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1428.32s)]
*  By the way that all of the money and resources [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1432.92s)]
*  That was given to the Palestinian people for infrastructure for schools [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1437.12s)]
*  And hospitals, yeah, but they have this massive network of terror tests [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1443.1599999999999s)]
*  And when you go inside it just is mind-numbing that this is how they're spending their time because they want to kill Israelis or take them hostage [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1448.04s)]
*  And but it taught me a lot about and being in border cities one border city in particular there wrote, you know [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1454.36s)]
*  10,000 rockets they've been hit with in ten years and these kids play indoors in bunker playgrounds [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1461.48s)]
*  My question to you is simple [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1467.6399999999999s)]
*  Joe Biden wants to give 100 million dollars to the Palestinians for humanitarian relief [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1470.5200000000002s)]
*  Sounds great on paper. I have zero confidence one penny will make it to the Palestinian people because Hamas has been [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1476.64s)]
*  Forcing people to stay and pointing guns and shooting at the road at the Palestinians that want to leave right? [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1484.44s)]
*  They use the Palestinians as as shields. They don't even provide the people with clean drinking water [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1490.88s)]
*  We're supposed to believe they're gonna use us aid for humanitarian purposes count me as a skeptic [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1496.2s)]
*  Okay, we've got to be very careful about what we're doing there [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1502.1200000000001s)]
*  You do not want to further empower the terrorist groups [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1504.96s)]
*  Our heart goes out the innocent Palestinian people, of course as we do to anyone who's in a terrible situation like that [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1507.3600000000001s)]
*  But we have to be very discerning in our policy and in our approach to this [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1513.68s)]
*  And so that's why we're demanding House Republicans are demanding more information from the White House so that we can help and make these critical [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1517.48s)]
*  Decisions look we're going to stand by Israel, but we have to be careful in how it's done [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1524.2s)]
*  What about the hundred million for humanitarian relief of the Palestinians? I think it's a tough issue [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1527.68s)]
*  I mean, we're gonna have to see what that is tied to and I'll tell you the House Democrats [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1533.4s)]
*  Of course are very resolute on that and they try to portray us as being uncaring [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1537.44s)]
*  Look, we care about that as well, but we have to be very careful that we're not further funding terrorist organizations [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1541.3600000000001s)]
*  That are trying to wipe Israel off the map. Can you explain why? [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1547.72s)]
*  Then President Obama Vice President Biden did this billion dollar deal with Iran [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1551.48s)]
*  Can you explain why Joe Biden made a deal with the Iranians? [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1557.52s)]
*  For six billion dollars to be freed up in money that was held that they had no access to [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1562.08s)]
*  We're yeah, we're in fits over that. I don't understand it at all [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1568.08s)]
*  I don't understand most of their foreign policy and I think it's gotten us in the shape that we're in we have big disagreements with them [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1571.56s)]
*  We're asking for [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1577.4399999999998s)]
*  And demand and accountability on that as well [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1579.04s)]
*  And we have to the White House has to improve how they're messaging this and how they're explaining it to people [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1581.4399999999998s)]
*  Because we all have to understand that we have a right to this is the precious treasure of the American people [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1588.04s)]
*  And if you're sending Iran money, we know that Iran is directly tied to all this [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1593.1599999999999s)]
*  These are Hamas and Hezbollah are proxies of Iran and they're tied in now with Russia and China [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1597.6s)]
*  I mean it is a new axis of evil. That's how we see it [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1603.28s)]
*  And so it has to be addressed [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1605.7s)]
*  Israel with all the funding of terror and all these terror organizations [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1607.7s)]
*  They within their right to fight back and course directly at Iran [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1611.18s)]
*  Of course [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1614.68s)]
*  That was the first as you noted the first act of my speakership is that we pass that resolution to [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1615.3000000000002s)]
*  Articulate that make it very clear where we stand the house is back in business and we're going to stand with Israel [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1621.14s)]
*  Let's ask I call it the new axis of evil China Russia Iran. Yeah, how big a threat? It's huge [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1626.98s)]
*  It's the biggest threat since World War two. We have been the big kid on the block, right? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1633.6s)]
*  We're the last real superpower and after the [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1637.8s)]
*  USSR fell we've been unrivaled now [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1640.8799999999999s)]
*  China is a near peer-to-peer adversary to us now and of course their goal is to rebuild the Empire [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1643.56s)]
*  And so we're doing everything we can to ensure that we maintain our military superiority [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1649.84s)]
*  We're the only nation that has the ability to project power and force like that around the globe right now [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1654.8s)]
*  But China is doing its best to encroach upon that power and you see they're even putting outposts around us [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1660.54s)]
*  They're buying up farmland and states here in the US [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1666.22s)]
*  All of these things have to be addressed at the federal level at the state level with the legislatures and even in some of these localities [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1669.82s)]
*  We have Chinese [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1675.6599999999999s)]
*  CCP owned companies that are coming in an open shop on Main Street in some towns in our [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1677.34s)]
*  Buying our farmland. Yes, they're buying our ranch land and they're buying land near military installations [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1682.5s)]
*  Would we be allowed to buy it there? [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1688.38s)]
*  Of course not [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1690.38s)]
*  And they allowed a you know, a Chinese spy balloon to float unimpeded across the country for eight days [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1691.5800000000002s)]
*  You know, we have we scratched our heads a lot around here about these Biden decisions [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1696.98s)]
*  And I don't know it may be tied in some way to I don't know some of the money they receive from some of these [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1700.8000000000002s)]
*  Well, you are on the House Judiciary Committee. We've been watching the House Oversight Committee with James Comer [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1706.26s)]
*  Let me ask you there's issues involving two congressmen in particular a Democrat and a Republican [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1710.5s)]
*  George Santos the Republican [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1716.22s)]
*  Many charges have been filed against him and then the issue of Congresswoman to leave [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1718.54s)]
*  and and others and this talk of censure and talk of removal you [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1724.46s)]
*  Support either we're working through those issues. I'll tell you I talked to [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1730.02s)]
*  The the authors of some of these resolutions today that want to deal with that. Here's the reality Sean [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1734.6200000000001s)]
*  We have a four-seat majority in the house [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1739.42s)]
*  It is possible that that number may be reduced even more in the coming weeks and months [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1741.98s)]
*  And so we'll have what may be the most razor-thin majority in the history of the Congress [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1747.46s)]
*  We have no margin for error. And so George Santos is due due process, right? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1752.78s)]
*  He is my understanding is I think he's appearing in a federal court tomorrow and we have to allow due process to play itself out [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1757.98s)]
*  That's what our system of justice is for he's not convicted. He's not gonna make these charged [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1765.54s)]
*  And so if we're going to expel people from Congress just because they're charged with a crime then you know [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1770.34s)]
*  They're accused that that's a that's a problem. Joe Biden has allowed over seven and a half million people into this country illegally [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1774.3999999999999s)]
*  It'll be probably over eight million even people on terror watch lists even people from countries like Iran and Syria [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1780.74s)]
*  How do you get the border secure and what is your assessment of? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1788.72s)]
*  Secretary of Homeland Security [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1793.94s)]
*  Mayorkas should he be impeached? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1796.74s)]
*  Listen, you know that my duties here have included judiciary and the select committee on the weaponization of the federal government in my assessment [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1799.5s)]
*  Almost every federal agency under the Biden administration has been weaponized that the very agencies that were designed to protect and serve the people [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1806.14s)]
*  Are now being used against them and we have many examples of that and you've talked about all of it on your show before [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1812.14s)]
*  Look, Mayorkas has been an abject failure in his position [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1817.22s)]
*  I believe he has committed impeachable offenses and I've been on a record saying that for a long long time [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1821.0s)]
*  In fact, he appeared in an oversight hearing in our House Judiciary Committee. We have jurisdiction over his department [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1825.5s)]
*  Less than four months into office and I saw where this was headed and I told him in a clip that went viral [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1831.3799999999999s)]
*  Mr. Mayorkas, you need to get your resume prepared because I thought he was headed towards a dead end on this [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1836.02s)]
*  Look, the investigations are going forward. Jamie Comer and the Oversight Committee are doing an exceptional job [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1842.06s)]
*  Jim Jordan is chairman of Judiciary has helped lead on that. We've gotten a lot of information on all these issues [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1846.54s)]
*  You're on the Judiciary Committee. Let me ask you. Do you believe that Joe Biden is Department of Justice? [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1853.18s)]
*  Do you believe our FBI has been politicized? Do you believe it's been weaponized? Do we have a dual justice system? [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1858.96s)]
*  Absolutely. We have a two-tiered system of justice and that that erodes the people's faith in our system of justice itself [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1864.14s)]
*  And this is what I reminded [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1870.22s)]
*  Merrick Garland when he was in front of us the Attorney General Christopher Wray at the FBI the greatest threat here is not these [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1871.6200000000001s)]
*  Individual issues it's that the people are losing their faith in our system of justice and Sean [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1877.94s)]
*  You cannot maintain a constitutional republic a government of by and for the people if the people doubt that the system is fair [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1881.78s)]
*  You know if they believe there's two tiers of justice then the system doesn't work at all [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1888.26s)]
*  And so I think Garland's been a great threat [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1892.74s)]
*  I think he's the worst Attorney General in the history of the United States [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1894.34s)]
*  Joe Biden swore to the American people both as a candidate and as president not one time [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1897.06s)]
*  Did he ever speak to his son his brother or anybody for that matter about their foreign business dealings? [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1903.1399999999999s)]
*  We know that as a flat-out lie [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1909.78s)]
*  We've learned from James Comer and his investigation that we are talking about tens of millions of dollars [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1911.9799999999998s)]
*  Taken in from a lot of adversarial countries some of our top geopolitical foes like China, Russia [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1918.1799999999998s)]
*  Ukraine [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1926.26s)]
*  Romania Mexico other countries tens of millions. They've discovered all of these [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1927.7399999999998s)]
*  Shell corporations, they've discovered nine particular [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1933.5s)]
*  Biden family members have been paid and then you have the issue of Joe on tape admitting that he [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1936.8999999999999s)]
*  Used our money taxpayer money to leverage a billion dollars in loan guarantees [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1942.6999999999998s)]
*  Which was Obama administration policy to fire a prosecutor investigating his son [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1947.6599999999999s)]
*  Well, one of the benefits of that his son continued to get paid for a job [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1952.54s)]
*  He admits he had no experience in at a time where he was dealing with a drug problem. That sound [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1956.54s)]
*  That's that sound like to you. That's a pretty good recitation of the facts [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1962.5s)]
*  And as John Adams said facts are stubborn things. They're hard to ignore [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1965.4s)]
*  I believe the documents are proving all that as my good brother [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1968.3600000000001s)]
*  Jamie Comer often says the bank records don't lie so we have the receipts on so much of this now. It's a real problem [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1973.1200000000001s)]
*  That's the reason that we shifted into the impeachment inquiry stage on the president himself [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1978.72s)]
*  Because if in fact all the evidence leads to where we believe it will that's very likely impeachable offenses [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1983.3600000000001s)]
*  You know that's listed as a cause for impeachment in the Constitution, you know bribery and other high crimes [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1989.92s)]
*  Misdemeanors bribery is listed there and it looks and smells a lot like that [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1995.56s)]
*  And I think the evidence we're gonna follow the truth where it leads [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=1999.6799999999998s)]
*  We're going to engage in due process because again, we're the rule of law party [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2002.24s)]
*  I know people are getting anxious and they're getting restless and they just want somebody to be impeached [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2005.76s)]
*  But that's not we don't do that like the other team [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2010.84s)]
*  We have to we have to base it upon the evidence and the evidence is coming together [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2012.76s)]
*  We'll see where it leads. Let me go back to the budget if I may for a second [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2016.6s)]
*  This whole issue of regular order [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2021.28s)]
*  But we have four of the twelve appropriations bills that have already been dealt with that my understanding is that's about 70% of the budget [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2024.0s)]
*  Yeah, so you have eight more to go [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2031.16s)]
*  You've talked about a short-term CR [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2033.44s)]
*  That you would be willing to maybe have until January or maybe even to April would there be we talk about a clean CR [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2036.68s)]
*  Would you have conditions for example Chip Roy and Byron Donald's had a plan? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2044.96s)]
*  Okay, well we'll give you a CR but it's not gonna be clean [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2050.48s)]
*  We're gonna cut government spending by 8% and we're gonna secure the border and protect our military and veterans [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2053.52s)]
*  Would you would you have conditions to a CR? [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2059.7599999999998s)]
*  I think we have to if indeed we do that November 17th, of course is the deadline that was extended [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2062.6s)]
*  You got about coming quickly 21 days and and the we're speeding it up as quickly as possible [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2067.8799999999997s)]
*  That was my commitment to my colleagues when they named me speaker of the house and that work began today [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2073.04s)]
*  We passed one of the approach bills just a couple of hours ago before you arrived here [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2077.8s)]
*  We got it off the house floor the energy and water bill [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2081.48s)]
*  That was a big box that we had to check and we did that and so we're going forward a chip and Byron are at [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2084.48s)]
*  the table with others we're working through this with the ideas and trying to ensure that if [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2090.94s)]
*  Another stopgap measure is required that we do it with certain conditions [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2095.88s)]
*  And I think there will be conditions the American people can live with and and consensus that we can build around here in the house [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2100.0s)]
*  Let me let me ask you this [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2105.3599999999997s)]
*  We have two-thirds of this country now a living paycheck to paycheck. Yes, many of those people can't [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2107.68s)]
*  Afford bare necessities. I know Biden's been crowing about by dynamics. I know they got good numbers today [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2114.7999999999997s)]
*  However, a lot of economists I spoke to earlier today. This doesn't look good at all [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2121.0s)]
*  They think we're in a bubble that is about to burst and it's going to be even worse [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  Especially in the housing market its new home construction is stopping sale of pre-existing homes a disaster [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2129.92s)]
*  How bad is this economy? [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2136.52s)]
*  how long can we sustain another what two trillion in debt that Joe Biden took on last year and [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2138.6s)]
*  How do we get inflation down once and for all? I have friends of mine just three years ago [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2145.7200000000003s)]
*  They were getting interest rates at three a 30 year fixed rate mortgage at 30% now. What average is 8% [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2151.6s)]
*  Nobody's gonna sell their their home and buy another home at that because it's thousands of dollars more [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2157.98s)]
*  For the same type of home. It grinds the economy to a halt. It's a disaster [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2164.18s)]
*  That's the word you use and that's the appropriate word [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2168.02s)]
*  These are policy choices that got us in this situation if you remember if you rewind in your mind back to [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2170.06s)]
*  Right before the pandemic began, you know in the Trump administration [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2175.8199999999997s)]
*  We had the greatest economy in the history of the world and it wasn't by happenstance [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2178.74s)]
*  It's because we cut taxes cut regulations we focused on American energy dominance [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2182.22s)]
*  We were doing and following all the policies that led to economic success and growth for all Americans everyone in every demographic [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2187.46s)]
*  All boats were rising we can achieve that again [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2194.3399999999997s)]
*  But you have to do almost exactly the opposite of what the Biden administration is pursuing and doing [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2197.3399999999997s)]
*  This is not rocket science [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2202.7s)]
*  But we're so far down the road now that we have to make these changes quickly and we're trying to [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2204.22s)]
*  Urge our Democrat colleagues to take a look again at the basic facts. I mean interest rates are so high now [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2208.4199999999996s)]
*  They're going to continue to rise apparently double-digit. I could see it come. All right. Let me ask maybe the question this way [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2214.62s)]
*  Because you do have such a small majority and and obviously that didn't help Kevin McCarthy [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2221.22s)]
*  I think you should get rid of the motion to vacate mate and raise the bar dramatically 20 25 people at least [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2226.8199999999997s)]
*  My question is specifically on the economy if you pass your budgets [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2232.22s)]
*  In the house, you're going to send it over to the Senate. They're going to rip it up line by line [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2238.22s)]
*  You'll go into conference [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2242.94s)]
*  But the only way you can succeed is if you as speaker are able to hold your slim majority. Yes [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2244.74s)]
*  that's going to be a [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2252.1s)]
*  Herculean task. How do you plan on doing that? [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2254.58s)]
*  with truth and transparency and and relationships, you know, this is a business that's based on that and [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2258.3399999999997s)]
*  My colleagues trust me. I'm grateful for that [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2264.3799999999997s)]
*  It's earned and [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2266.8199999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna do well by them or we're gonna govern well, we're gonna show the American people we can you know when you get into [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2268.62s)]
*  the negotiations in the conference committee [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2273.62s)]
*  The speaker of the house and the leader of our party has to have a strong hand [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2275.8599999999997s)]
*  And so if we can keep the team together keep rowing in the same direction [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2279.62s)]
*  Look, everybody's got to give up on some of their preferences. None of us are gonna get everything we want [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2283.54s)]
*  We never I'll never ask any of my colleagues to compromise core principles because I share those principles with them, right? [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2288.06s)]
*  But Ronald Reagan used to teach us I'd rather get 80% of what I want and go over the cliff with a flag-waving [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2293.86s)]
*  I still believe in that idea and I'm very optimistic. I am bullish on the future of America [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2298.62s)]
*  I am bullish on our chances to change the way Washington works Sean. We have a once-in-a-lifetime [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2303.58s)]
*  Opportunity here. That's the vision. I've cast to my colleagues. I believe it to my core [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2309.02s)]
*  We're gonna take this day by day decision by decision [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2312.7400000000002s)]
*  But keep everybody together and move the ball forward for the American people [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2315.66s)]
*  I genuinely believe that we can get this done one of the things that I have said over and over again to anybody that'll listen [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2319.38s)]
*  Although I can look in this camera and say honestly nobody ever listens to me. Not true. Not true, but I try is [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2325.1400000000003s)]
*  It's my strong belief that all Republicans you're either gonna win together or you're gonna be in the eyes of the American people [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2331.46s)]
*  You're gonna win on your agenda or you're gonna lose and I don't see any way of winning if you don't all stick together [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2339.5s)]
*  I know you have these this disparate group of [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2345.78s)]
*  Egos if you will, I hope everybody will maybe hear your admonition and [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2349.14s)]
*  Work together as a team and go forward, you know fix our border. Can we become energy dominant and maybe start paying down our debt? [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2354.98s)]
*  Can we come up with sound foreign policy to help out our allies in a time of you know, a dire time for them? [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2363.9s)]
*  I mean these challenges are run deep and then you have the issue of law and order safety security [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2370.64s)]
*  Open borders pretty scary times. Do you think this country's in decline? I think right now we're in very desperate times [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2377.3799999999997s)]
*  I think the hours late and the crisis is great [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2383.9399999999996s)]
*  but here's why I'm encouraged in previous generations of Americans from the framers the founders of this country all the way through at times the [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2385.8599999999997s)]
*  Revolutionary period the Civil War the Great Depression the other world wars when the leaders here got in [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2393.06s)]
*  Trouble that was beyond the scope of what they could solve themselves individually or collectively, you know what they did [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2399.2599999999998s)]
*  They sought divine guidance for it. We have in God we trust right above the rostrum there [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2404.2s)]
*  And I pointed that out in my speech is this the the Ben Franklin moment. It is a Ben Franklin constitutional convention [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2407.7999999999997s)]
*  Exactly, right. It's the same thing and we're we're calling one another to to humble ourselves and recognize that the challenges are so great [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2413.92s)]
*  But that's where a real opportunity is presented. I believe that God is not done with America yet. Okay, I still believe in that motto [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2421.16s)]
*  It's not just a quaint saying to me. That's what the nation was founded upon this belief [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2427.52s)]
*  It's what distinguishes us from all these other communist Marxist socialist countries around the world [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2432.5s)]
*  It's the key to our greatness and we ought to appeal to that and I believe if we do [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2436.78s)]
*  That the God is going to give us his favor and I believe we're gonna solve these problems [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2441.42s)]
*  I I did ask you before the show and I'll make this the last question and I [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2445.14s)]
*  said [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2449.54s)]
*  Because I believe that if you take this majority and you can somehow pull these disparate groups together [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2450.7s)]
*  I do believe it would be good for the country because as a you know, I'm very clear about my conservatism [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2456.46s)]
*  I believe those policies are best for our country and I want the best for our country as each country [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2462.1s)]
*  I've had a life frankly, that's undeserved and [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2467.42s)]
*  I just really so I asked you I said would it be okay if it came back when you get settled? [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2470.9s)]
*  You've had less than 48 hours. You know, we appreciate you doing the interview [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2475.7799999999997s)]
*  and bring the disparate groups in a room and do it for an hour and [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2479.7799999999997s)]
*  See what issues that we can find full agreement on I would like to know what those issues are and where the disagreements are [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2485.18s)]
*  You'd be willing to have us back. Of course. We're working on that and that's a great admonition [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2491.34s)]
*  Look, this place is filled with people of good faith or deep conviction and they understand the necessity of working together some big egos [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2495.34s)]
*  Mr. Speaker. Yeah. Well, but Washington has that sometimes we're gonna work through it. I'm optimistic. All right, mr. Speaker. We appreciate you time [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFsM6b0IS8&t=2501.82s)]
