# Biden admin has treated US troops as 'cannon fodder' in Middle East: Expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4)
*  Onto a Fox News alert, US and British warships shooting down 15 Houthi drones fired from [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=0.0s)]
*  Yemen on Saturday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=4.9s)]
*  US Central Command says the unmanned aircraft systems were assessed to be one-way attack [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=6.4s)]
*  drones and were shot down with no damage to ships in the area or reported injuries. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=10.84s)]
*  Mike Cirelli is a retired Navy SEAL and recon marine veteran, and he joins me now. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=16.14s)]
*  Mike, good morning to you. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=20.6s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=21.72s)]
*  Fifteen drone attacks in a single day. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=23.28s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=25.52s)]
*  What should we know about this? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=26.6s)]
*  Carly, great to be joining you guys. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=29.0s)]
*  The consistent aggression by Iran and their proxies like the Houthis present a clear danger [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=31.400000000000002s)]
*  not only to American troops, but you've got international maritime security in trade. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=38.0s)]
*  I'll tell you this, our military has been able to counteract the attacks, but it only [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=43.24s)]
*  takes one to get past our defenses. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=48.0s)]
*  And then what? [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  If it takes the life of an American service member, we're in a bad situation. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=51.120000000000005s)]
*  Our hesitancy to address these Iranian provocations not only sets a bad precedent, but it also [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=55.44s)]
*  endangers our troops. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=62.239999999999995s)]
*  I understand the hesitancy did not expand the conflict in the Middle East, but again, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=64.2s)]
*  I think we're kicking the can down the road if we don't deal with Iran for future generations [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=68.72s)]
*  to deal with. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=73.28s)]
*  Well, the Biden administration has been hesitant to respond to these Houthi attacks for fear [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=74.28s)]
*  of provoking Iran. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=79.4s)]
*  The Pentagon has moved the Dwight D. Eisenhower carrier strike group from the Persian Gulf [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=81.42s)]
*  to the Gulf of Aden, which is off the coast of Yemen. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=85.53999999999999s)]
*  That could be a warning or maybe in preparation for a possible retaliatory move by the United [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=89.53999999999999s)]
*  States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=96.53999999999999s)]
*  What do you think about that fear? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=97.53999999999999s)]
*  And also, what should the U.S. be doing in response to these drone attacks? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=99.17999999999999s)]
*  We should have responded decisively when the first attack happened on American bases in [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=104.41999999999999s)]
*  Syria and Iraq. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=109.38000000000001s)]
*  If we don't, we are incentivizing bad behavior by Iran. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=111.66s)]
*  Additionally, you know, how long is it going to take for the Gulf Cooperation Council and [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=115.26s)]
*  all those states to actually get involved when it affects the energy markets through [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=119.98s)]
*  that maritime trade? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=124.10000000000001s)]
*  So if we don't react, Iran will continue to conduct attacks through their proxies on American [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=126.58000000000001s)]
*  forces. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=132.66s)]
*  Well, you're right about that. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=133.66s)]
*  Just look at the numbers. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=134.66s)]
*  On July 17th, there have been at least 98 attacks on U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=135.66s)]
*  The good news is that none of them have really been successful. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=141.85999999999999s)]
*  And I was wondering if that was by design, by these Iranian-backed proxies, or are we [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=145.7s)]
*  just really good at intercepting these missiles and drones? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=150.06s)]
*  We still have the best military in the world. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=154.82s)]
*  Again, we've been able to counteract these threats, but the enemy will evolve and they'll [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=156.74s)]
*  innovate as well until they get one past our defenses. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=162.18s)]
*  Again, I do not want to tell an American family that we did nothing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=164.98s)]
*  We did not act decisively. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=169.57999999999998s)]
*  And accordingly, they lost the lives of their loved ones. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=171.73999999999998s)]
*  Our troops have essentially become cannon fodder. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=175.14s)]
*  And again, this goes to our numbers in the military are at the lowest since 1941. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=177.85999999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=183.57999999999998s)]
*  And that's exactly you led me into the next thing that I wanted to talk to you about. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=184.57999999999998s)]
*  We do have the best military in the world, but you are right. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=188.72s)]
*  It is smaller than it has been in over 80 years as we go into 2024. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  This year, the armed services missed the recruiting goal by 41,000 people. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=197.85999999999999s)]
*  There's just a major recruiting challenge in recruiting young people. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=202.77999999999997s)]
*  Is there a solution to this problem? [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=205.7s)]
*  Well, Carly, let me start on a good note. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=207.73999999999998s)]
*  I just returned from talking to the 27th Fighter Squadron. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=210.7s)]
*  This squadron flies the F-22 Raptors. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=214.06s)]
*  And in fact, this is the same squadron that shot the Chinese spy balloon out of the sky. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=215.66s)]
*  They are well-led, they are well-trained and prepared for the challenges that await them. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=219.98s)]
*  The few in the military have always carried the burden for the many. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=224.06s)]
*  But the alarming decrease in numbers not only poses a threat to our national security and [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=227.85999999999999s)]
*  defense strategy, but it also raises a question. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=232.57999999999998s)]
*  Can we confront the emerging global threats? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=236.14s)]
*  This is not a recruitment issue. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=239.7s)]
*  This is a leadership problem. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=241.56s)]
*  Talent begets talent. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=243.82s)]
*  Quite frankly, why would this younger generation want to go work for an administration that [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=246.06s)]
*  uses their troops as cannon fodder in the Middle East like we're seeing? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=251.38s)]
*  The administration, instead of creating a lethal force in raising our technology capabilities, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=255.86s)]
*  has decided to implement woke progressive policies like renaming bases and funding or [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=263.86s)]
*  providing additional funding for DE&I programs. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=272.9s)]
*  Our military is designed to be lethal, to deter our enemies and if necessary, win wars. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=275.97999999999996s)]
*  The younger generation wants to work for strong leaders and we're not seeing that from this [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=282.14s)]
*  administration. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=286.09999999999997s)]
*  Well, when we have wars in the Middle East and Europe and that looming threat in China, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=287.09999999999997s)]
*  this is certainly a major issue. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=290.46s)]
*  But Mike, we thank you for your service and also for joining us this morning. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=291.9s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=295.14s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LYdnsToW3Z4&t=305.46s)]
