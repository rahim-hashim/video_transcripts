# 'NON-NEGOTIABLE': Retired U.S. General warns Israel won't allow Hamas in Gaza
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g)
*  Alicia, so what can we expect from Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the White House as the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=0.0s)]
*  ceasefire deal continues to hold? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=4.32s)]
*  Let's ask retired U.S. Army General Dana Pidar. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=7.08s)]
*  General, thank you so much for being here. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=10.0s)]
*  It seems as though these two men, Netanyahu and Trump, have been very supportive of each [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=13.4s)]
*  other in the past. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=19.32s)]
*  But there is a potential difference here in that, obviously, President Trump wants the [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=20.8s)]
*  situation in the Middle East to be quiet so he can focus on other priorities here at home. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=26.8s)]
*  Netanyahu has some pressure from his right wing to resume the war when we get to the [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=33.08s)]
*  second phase. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=38.08s)]
*  So how do you see the meeting at the White House playing out, General? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=39.08s)]
*  Well, good morning, Jonathan. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=43.32s)]
*  You're right. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=46.6s)]
*  It's really an opportunity. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=47.6s)]
*  It's an opportunity with President Trump's relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=48.6s)]
*  Netanyahu for more stability in the region and possibly even peace. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=54.28s)]
*  But that's got to be shaped. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=61.040000000000006s)]
*  And it's going to be, I assume, some very hard discussions as far as what the next steps [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=62.56s)]
*  are. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=67.60000000000001s)]
*  There's a real opportunity here for possible peace agreements between the Palestinians, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=68.60000000000001s)]
*  Israelis, Israel and Lebanon, Israel and Syria. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=74.96000000000001s)]
*  But that's got to start with freeing all the hostages. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=80.0s)]
*  It's got to start with humanitarian assistance to Gaza and eventually investment and rebuilding [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=83.12s)]
*  of Gaza. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=89.12s)]
*  And, General, it strikes me, though, that the right wing in Israel is very concerned. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=90.12s)]
*  When we see the pictures of the hostages being released, for instance, we see many, many [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=98.2s)]
*  Hamas fighters, all of them masked, standing there. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=106.04s)]
*  It is impossible for Netanyahu to argue that he has achieved his goal of destroying Hamas. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=109.56s)]
*  And there are many in his coalition government who thinks that he has to fulfil that goal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=116.60000000000001s)]
*  That means resuming the war in phase two. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=122.52000000000001s)]
*  He cannot claim he's destroyed Hamas at this point, can he? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=124.92s)]
*  Possibly not, because Hamas still has capabilities. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=130.6s)]
*  But wars are resolved through negotiations and peace. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=133.84s)]
*  Israel has, for the most part, won this war. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=138.44s)]
*  Yes, Hamas has some capabilities, but they've won the war. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=141.56s)]
*  So now it's time to have the peace and rebuild Gaza, have a stable relationship between the [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Palestinians and Israel, which benefits both. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=152.16s)]
*  So do you believe that we will see a different governing authority other than Hamas in Gaza [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=156.2s)]
*  within the next 12 to 18 months, General? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=165.76s)]
*  I think that's actually non-negotiable. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=170.4s)]
*  There's no way Israel can have a government that involves Hamas on the Palestinian side. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=172.72s)]
*  So that must be a requirement of any kind of peace agreement, is Hamas is not a part of it. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=179.6s)]
*  And General, could I quickly turn to another major conflict, that between Russia and Ukraine? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=186.32s)]
*  It seems as though there is a great deal of pressure now on both sides from the Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=194.28s)]
*  administration to come towards some agreement. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=199.6s)]
*  Are you optimistic that there will be a peace deal in that conflict? [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=203.35999999999999s)]
*  And will it satisfy both sides? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=209.2s)]
*  Well, I think there's an absolute opportunity here with the incoming Trump administration, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=213.12s)]
*  which has relations with both Vladimir Putin of Russia and, of course, President Zelensky of Ukraine, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=218.4s)]
*  to bring both to the table. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=226.32s)]
*  Now, neither one will want to give up certain things, but they're both going to have to give [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=228.64000000000001s)]
*  up certain things if there's in fact going to be peace. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=233.84s)]
*  On the Ukrainian side, Ukraine has got to understand that they will not be able to keep [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=237.44s)]
*  all their territory. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=243.12s)]
*  President Trump has also talked about Ukraine having elections at some point in the near future. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=244.96s)]
*  And on the Russia side, Russia will have to be satisfied with the territory that they have [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=250.64s)]
*  and renounce any claims to additional territory for Ukraine and also agree that Ukraine can be a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=257.36s)]
*  part of NATO in the future. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=264.15999999999997s)]
*  Neither side wants those things, but to have a peace agreement, they're going to need to. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=266.88s)]
*  General Dana Pittard, pleasure to talk to you this morning. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=272.8s)]
*  Thank you so much for spending part of your Sunday with us, General. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=276.56s)]
*  Thank you, Jonathan. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zXE4R3fsG2g&t=280.64s)]
