# Secretary Blinken speaks to press from Cairo airport
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M)
*  to work on securing the release of hostages, including American citizens, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=0.0s)]
*  and to address the humanitarian crisis that exists in Gaza. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=5.0s)]
*  We started, as you know, in Israel. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=11.0s)]
*  And it was important to make it very clear that the United States has Israel's back. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=14.0s)]
*  We will stand with it today, tomorrow, and every day. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=20.0s)]
*  And we're doing that in word and also in deed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=24.0s)]
*  I spent time with Prime Minister Netanyahu to go through the needs that Israel may have [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=26.0s)]
*  to make sure it can effectively defend itself. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=31.0s)]
*  And you've already seen a lot of that assistance moving forward. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=34.0s)]
*  And that's a conversation that will continue. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=38.0s)]
*  Israel has the right, indeed it has the obligation, to defend itself against these attacks from Hamas [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=41.0s)]
*  and to try to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=47.0s)]
*  As I said in Tel Aviv, as President Biden has said, the way that Israel does this matters. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=52.0s)]
*  It needs to do it in a way that affirms the shared values that we have for human life and human dignity, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=58.0s)]
*  taking every possible precaution to avoid harming civilians. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=67.0s)]
*  After we left Israel, we've gone now to, I think I've lost track, but to six countries in the region. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=72.0s)]
*  Jordan, Bahrain, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, now here in Egypt. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=81.0s)]
*  And the purpose of seeing all of our partners was, first and foremost, to listen to them, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=89.0s)]
*  to hear how they're seeing this crisis, and to look at what we can do together [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=95.0s)]
*  to deal with many of the concerns that it's raised. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=100.0s)]
*  What I've heard from virtually every partner was a determination, a shared view, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=103.0s)]
*  to do what it can to make sure that this never happens again. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=111.0s)]
*  And I think that's what we need to do. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=116.0s)]
*  And I think that's what we need to do. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=119.0s)]
*  And I think that's what we need to do. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=121.0s)]
*  And I think that's what we need to do. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=123.0s)]
*  And I think that's what we need to do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1tdcx5tS5M&t=125.0s)]
