# What's next in the 'complex' Middle East situation?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg)
*  Hello America, I'm Mark Levin and this is Life, Liberty and Levin Saturday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=0.0s)]
*  Right at the top of the program we're going to start with our friend Trey Yngst who is [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=8.16s)]
*  Trey Yngst, so we have this deal obviously with Hamas. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=9.16s)]
*  I have a couple of questions for you. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=13.52s)]
*  First of all, I think it's important for the American people to know that the prime minister [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=15.4s)]
*  of Israel is not like a president of the United States, particularly in Israel where you have [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=19.44s)]
*  all these fractured parties, these tiny parties where three or four or five out of 120 members [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=23.96s)]
*  of the Knesset can bring down a government, correct? [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=29.62s)]
*  Absolutely, and that was the prime minister's big challenge as he got this deal together [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=32.34s)]
*  with the help of the Americans, the Qataris and the Egyptians. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=36.58s)]
*  There were far-right members of the coalition who said, look, if the hostages get released, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=39.86s)]
*  we have to be able to go back into war against Hamas. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=44.72s)]
*  And that's some of the details of what we'll talk about in this agreement. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=47.74s)]
*  And in fact, they can go back, if I've read correctly from the various published reports, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=50.980000000000004s)]
*  It's three phases. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=56.34s)]
*  And if Hamas does renege or starts shooting missiles into Israel and so forth and so on, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=58.42s)]
*  Israel has the right to go in and do what Israel needs to do, correct? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=63.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=67.9s)]
*  And President-elect Trump has made clear through his team on the ground in the Middle East [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=68.9s)]
*  that if Hamas does break the ceasefire agreement, the Israelis will have the support of the [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=72.5s)]
*  incoming American administration to take the battle back against Hamas. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=77.42s)]
*  This is extremely delicate. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=81.64s)]
*  And Friday morning, after a night of celebration in both Israel and Gaza about an agreement, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=83.28s)]
*  things started to fall apart. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=89.28s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, through his office, released a statement saying [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=90.76s)]
*  Hamas was going back on the agreement that was hammered out in Doha, Qatar. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=94.12s)]
*  Negotiating teams were able to sit back at the table and iron out some of those last [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=98.84s)]
*  details. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=103.44s)]
*  And it looks like Sunday afternoon, we will see the first hostages released from Hamas [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=104.44s)]
*  captivity along the Gaza border. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=109.46000000000001s)]
*  Which is always wonderful, when you can get hostages out of a hostile country or hostile [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=111.76s)]
*  territory with terrorists and so forth. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=116.2s)]
*  But there is this forever long debate, isn't there, that when you negotiate over hostages, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  you encourage the taking of more hostages. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=125.56s)]
*  And Hamas in particular, this seems to be one of the primary things that it does when [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=127.72s)]
*  it attacks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=133.24s)]
*  It goes in and it grabs hostages because he knows, at least for the Jewish state, they [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=134.72s)]
*  want those people back. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=139.4s)]
*  So do you think that will encourage potentially more of that? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=140.76s)]
*  It certainly could. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=144.0s)]
*  And look, it's a concern of the Israelis. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=145.0s)]
*  Surprisingly, this deal is not popular across the political spectrum here in Israel. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=146.76s)]
*  And it is because of the price that the Israelis will have to pay to get these innocent hostages [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=152.35999999999999s)]
*  home. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=157.64s)]
*  They will be trading Palestinian prisoners, some of them who are convicted of terrorism [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=158.64s)]
*  and murder, that are currently serving life sentences in Israeli prisons with affiliation [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=163.84s)]
*  to Hamas and Islamic Jihad. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=168.64s)]
*  They're going to have to release them back into the West Bank or into Gaza. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=170.54s)]
*  And it raises questions about what the future of this broader conflict is going to look [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=174.26s)]
*  like. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=178.34s)]
*  Earlier in the week, we saw the current U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken say that [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=179.34s)]
*  Hamas has been able to recruit just as many gunmen as it's lost since this conflict began. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=183.26s)]
*  And now some of the leaders, some of the people, the masterminds behind other attacks against [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=189.18s)]
*  Israelis will be free as a result of this agreement. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=193.32s)]
*  And as the Israelis have seen during past agreements like Gilad Shalid, when we saw [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=197.3s)]
*  this Israeli soldier exchanged for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners, some of those, and in that deal, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=201.58s)]
*  Yahya Sinwar, the mastermind behind the October 7 massacre, can go back onto the battlefield. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=207.82000000000002s)]
*  And so it's certainly a complex situation and a major concern for the Israelis. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=213.46s)]
*  I want to be clear about something, I want to clarify something. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=216.94s)]
*  This isn't a peace deal. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=220.46s)]
*  This is a ceasefire, perhaps a temporary ceasefire. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=222.3s)]
*  Isn't that right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=227.74s)]
*  There's a difference between a peace treaty and a peace deal and a ceasefire. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=228.62s)]
*  When you're dealing with a terrorist organization, it's very difficult, isn't it, to even get [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=233.9s)]
*  your mind around a peace deal when they exist for the purpose of destroying you? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=237.86s)]
*  That's a very accurate characterization. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=242.54000000000002s)]
*  This is not a peace deal by any means. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=244.54000000000002s)]
*  This is a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas in a 15-plus month long war that's [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=246.62s)]
*  been unfolding. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=252.86s)]
*  The statement that was released on camera by the de facto leader of Hamas illustrates [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=253.86s)]
*  that. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=259.02000000000004s)]
*  Despite the fact that there is an agreement to at least temporarily end the fighting inside [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=260.02000000000004s)]
*  Gaza, he celebrated October 7th and insinuated that the organization would continue to carry [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=263.74s)]
*  out attacks against the Israelis. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=269.84000000000003s)]
*  And so this was not an off-ramp for a broader conflict in the Middle East. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=272.02000000000004s)]
*  It's simply going to be a pause in the current conflict between Israel and Hamas, specifically [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=275.40000000000003s)]
*  inside Gaza. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=280.78000000000003s)]
*  It says nothing about the West Bank, and the Hamas and Islamic Jihad cells that the Israelis [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=282.02s)]
*  operate on a daily basis against there. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=286.5s)]
*  There's some talk about Abbas. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=289.21999999999997s)]
*  He's almost 90 years old. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=290.62s)]
*  He's not in good health. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=291.9s)]
*  The Fatah party, which competes with Hamas, they had sort of a civil war there early on, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=292.9s)]
*  and Hamas won and they took over Gaza. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=299.94s)]
*  And the talk is that when he dies, that Hamas will even have more of an ability, more room [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=303.44s)]
*  to grab power in Judea, Samaria, other parts of the area there against Fatah. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  Do you see that as a possibility too? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=316.48s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=319.32s)]
*  Look, in the course of our reporting, we speak with everyone in the region, and I've talked [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=320.32s)]
*  to Palestinians both in Gaza and in places like Ramallah and Jenin to get a sense of [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=323.44s)]
*  where they stand after this conflict. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=329.48s)]
*  And the support for Hamas is widespread. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=332.52000000000004s)]
*  And without getting too far into the weeds, many Palestinians look at Fatah. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=335.48s)]
*  They look at the Palestinian Authority and they see an organization that is corrupt. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=340.04s)]
*  They see the people around Mahmoud Abbas that have been promoted and taken the very high [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=344.36s)]
*  tax dollars and the U.S. dollars that flowed into these areas and put the money in their [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=349.6s)]
*  own pockets. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=354.4s)]
*  And so they see Hamas as the only organization fighting for their interests on their behalf. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=355.52s)]
*  And so Hamas maintains popular support in these locations. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=360.52s)]
*  And so when Abbas ultimately does die, it's going to set up a massive question in the [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=364.62s)]
*  region about who's going to take over if Hamas could seize control in a city like Ramallah [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=370.42s)]
*  and then be able to basically control not only the West Bank, but in a way Gaza, even [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=375.94s)]
*  if another leader is brought into the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=381.34000000000003s)]
*  And this is sort of something that we should talk about. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=384.78000000000003s)]
*  You hear the Biden administration talk about a transition government in Gaza and the ability [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=386.86s)]
*  for a third party to come in and create a stable situation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=391.32s)]
*  That's nice on paper and it's nice to talk about that as an ideal sort of utopia for [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=395.32s)]
*  the region. But the reality on the ground is quite different. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=400.3s)]
*  As the secretary of state said this week, they've been able to recruit more fighters. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=403.0s)]
*  They still have popular support in many different areas. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=407.2s)]
*  And without looking just at the words, you can look at the images. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=410.44s)]
*  Last Thursday, whenever this went through and we saw the celebrations in Gaza, there [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=413.84000000000003s)]
*  were masked Hamas gunmen in the streets of cities like Hanyounis and Dar al-Bala in the [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=419.36s)]
*  Gaza Strip. And they were celebrating because they are looking at what happened as a [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=423.72s)]
*  victory. And there's a real possibility that that sentiment carries over into places [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=428.44s)]
*  like Ramallah, Jenin, Tokaram, these areas that still have popular support among Hamas. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=433.44s)]
*  You talk about popular support among Palestinians for Hamas. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=438.6s)]
*  We talked a lot in this country over the course of the last year and a half about [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=442.24s)]
*  distinguishing Hamas from the Palestinians. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=447.44s)]
*  And certainly there are instances of that. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=450.0s)]
*  But the truth is, the Palestinians in Gaza, you've looked at the surveys from [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=452.64000000000004s)]
*  Palestinian organizations and Arab organizations. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=457.84000000000003s)]
*  They do support Hamas, do they not? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=461.12s)]
*  It certainly exists on a spectrum. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=463.8s)]
*  And it's been interesting to watch as the war progressed, because we've been talking with a lot of [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=465.64000000000004s)]
*  civilians inside Gaza, medical workers and even members of Hamas. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=469.64000000000004s)]
*  And I can tell you, among the civilian population, there was a growing frustration as the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=474.71999999999997s)]
*  war continued that the war wasn't over. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=478.56s)]
*  They saw the destruction brought against the Gaza Strip as a result of Hamas actions [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=481.32s)]
*  specifically inside Gaza. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=486.35999999999996s)]
*  And when you look at the public opinion polls in places like Ramallah versus Gaza City, the [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=488.47999999999996s)]
*  support varies. And so I'd say the Palestinians we've talked to exist on a spectrum. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=493.47999999999996s)]
*  Certainly there are many who support the actions of Hamas. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=498.79999999999995s)]
*  And again, they see them as the only viable organization fighting on their behalf. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=501.92s)]
*  When they look at two options, Hamas or the Palestinian Authority, Fatah Party, they look at [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=506.76s)]
*  Hamas and they say this is an organization that committed an attack on behalf of the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=511.76s)]
*  Palestinian people. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=515.84s)]
*  And they look at the PA as a corrupt organization that is working with the Israelis. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=517.44s)]
*  And so it'll be interesting to see some public opinion polling post-war to see if it affected [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=522.2s)]
*  their support levels inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=526.92s)]
*  Understanding that if you go back to 2005, 2006, this was the organization that the [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=529.2800000000001s)]
*  Palestinian people voted for to lead their people specifically inside Gaza with a [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=534.1600000000001s)]
*  population of more than two million Palestinians. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=539.2800000000001s)]
*  It's hard to see how any Israeli government could really support a so-called two state [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=542.4000000000001s)]
*  solution, particularly given what you're just talking about. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=547.2s)]
*  There's an increased radicalization. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=549.88s)]
*  Fatah is really sort of a weak party in many respects. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=552.72s)]
*  And if Hamas is able to use this to further centralize authority under itself and there's [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=561.44s)]
*  not a real competing force, I don't know where all these peaceful Palestinian leaders are. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=567.32s)]
*  They're probably knocked off or they're afraid to speak or maybe most of them don't exist. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=572.4s)]
*  But I can't imagine an Israeli government saying, OK, we're going to have a two state [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=577.2s)]
*  solution and we're going to carve it out of Israel. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=580.84s)]
*  Can you? Yeah, I think that the Israeli government and the incoming American administration [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=583.1600000000001s)]
*  has to look at this at face value, what it looks like on the ground, because from the [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  beginning of this conflict, Israeli leadership, leadership from the Likud Party, I can [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=591.52s)]
*  remember a conversation that I had with Israel's former defense minister, Yoav Galant, when [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  he was talking about an idea of creating basically islands inside the Gaza Strip where the [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=599.96s)]
*  Israelis and the Americans would try to empower clan leaders or business leaders in this [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=605.0s)]
*  area to prop them up and build almost safe zones from Hamas control inside Gaza. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=610.32s)]
*  And when they started to experiment with this, they saw that armed gunmen would take over [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=616.4000000000001s)]
*  the aid and threaten anyone who basically questioned their rule inside the Gaza Strip. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=620.7600000000001s)]
*  And so it's not a simple fix. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=625.7600000000001s)]
*  The other thing to talk about is the war objectives. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=627.44s)]
*  One of the key objectives for the Israelis laid out from the beginning of this conflict [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=629.8000000000001s)]
*  was to defeat and destroy Hamas. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=633.6s)]
*  Hamas is not defeated or destroyed inside the Gaza Strip or in other locations. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=635.7600000000001s)]
*  And so they have to look at that and say, this is what we are dealing with on the ground. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=640.6s)]
*  They still are capable of carrying out attacks. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=644.8800000000001s)]
*  We saw in the images on Thursday night from inside the Gaza Strip, they still have [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=647.72s)]
*  weapons. Certainly the rocket arsenal has been largely destroyed by the Israeli air [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=651.96s)]
*  and ground campaign against Gaza. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=656.6800000000001s)]
*  But as we look forward, they are not destroyed as an organization. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=658.7600000000001s)]
*  And as we've talked about, they still have what you could argue in many locations as [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=661.6800000000001s)]
*  a majority support among the Palestinian people. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=666.48s)]
*  And so it raises questions about what comes next. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=669.76s)]
*  What does the day after look like inside Gaza? [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=672.28s)]
*  And that question at this point can't be answered. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=675.28s)]
*  Trey Yngst, I want to thank you. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p_w7Q3s4Eg&t=677.88s)]
