# Trey Yingst: Killing of Hezbollah leader 'ups the ante for the entire region'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [September 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA)
*  We're back with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=0.0s)]
*  The IDF says Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah's reign of terror is over and it's been confirmed [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=1.92s)]
*  by Hezbollah. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=7.24s)]
*  The Iranian-backed terror group's leader was killed in a massive strike in Beirut. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=8.92s)]
*  Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowing to win the war in yesterday's fiery speech [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=13.92s)]
*  to the UN General Assembly. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=18.8s)]
*  As long as Hezbollah chooses the path of war, Israel has no choice and Israel has every [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=21.48s)]
*  right to remove this threat and return our citizens to their homes safely. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=27.64s)]
*  And that's exactly what we're doing. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=32.72s)]
*  Joining us live from Haifa in Israel, our chief foreign correspondent, Trey Yengst. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=37.2s)]
*  Trey, we've been discussing this all morning. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=42.08s)]
*  Break down the significance of Israel finally killing Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=44.04s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, Pete, it's extremely significant when we look at what's taken place over the past [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=54.16s)]
*  year. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=58.64s)]
*  Thousands of rockets raining down on northern Israeli cities, anti-tank guided missile attacks [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=59.64s)]
*  along the border, all of them ordered by Hassan Nasrallah, the secretary general of Hezbollah, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=64.64s)]
*  a man who controlled the organization since 1992. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=70.32s)]
*  There were these massive strikes in the Lebanese capital of Beirut yesterday and Fox News learned [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=73.88s)]
*  that the target was Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=77.96s)]
*  Now, it took hours for the Israeli military to come out and confirm that he was indeed [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=80.24s)]
*  killed in this strike in Beirut. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  And then following that confirmation, we've seen more rocket fire from Hezbollah into [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=87.47999999999999s)]
*  northern and even central Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=91.6s)]
*  So the concern here is that the situation on the ground could unravel further and that [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=94.0s)]
*  the Iranian regime could directly respond for the killing of Nasrallah. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=98.28s)]
*  Remember, Hezbollah is the group's largest proxy across the Middle East. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=102.32s)]
*  When you look at the IRGC, Iran's military wing, we understand that a deputy commander [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=106.76s)]
*  was also killed alongside Nasrallah. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=112.28s)]
*  And this ups the ante for the entire region. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=114.96000000000001s)]
*  As we wait to see what comes next, we can expect Israeli warnings to civilians already. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=117.30000000000001s)]
*  We understand that gatherings have been limited in the central part of this country. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=122.9s)]
*  And this is an indication that Israeli officials are concerned about the possibility of retaliation [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=126.86000000000001s)]
*  following the strike that killed the leader of Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=131.78s)]
*  Pete? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=136.07999999999998s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=137.07999999999998s)]
*  Trey, how likely do you think this, I've asked everybody this question, you know this better [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=138.07999999999998s)]
*  than anybody else. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  Do you think an Iranian response will be substantive or performative? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=143.67999999999998s)]
*  Are they at a place where they really want a wider conflict with Israel at this point? [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=146.72s)]
*  Based on our reporting, performative is the short answer because the Iranian regime understands [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  the high cost that a war with Israel would inflict on their country after losing not [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=157.6s)]
*  only Hezbollah leadership but also Hamas leadership. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=162.92s)]
*  The Israelis are systematically taking out the leadership of Iranian proxies across the [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=166.2s)]
*  Middle East. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=169.88s)]
*  So a direct conflict would weaken the regime in Tehran and they now have lost key abilities [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=170.88s)]
*  not just from Gaza but also from Lebanon as the Israelis take out the rocket and missile [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=175.76s)]
*  launching positions of Hezbollah. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=180.76s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=182.64s)]
*  Well this most recent round of fighting started because of a brutal attack on October 7th [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=183.64s)]
*  and now you've written the definitive first hand account of what happened on October 7th [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=189.56s)]
*  called Black Saturday and the ensuing wars. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=194.84s)]
*  This is the next chapter of it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=197.84s)]
*  Tell us again about the book Trey. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=202.0s)]
*  Black Saturday is a book about the day this war began and I interview officials from across [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=203.64s)]
*  the Israeli defense echelon including the defense minister Yoav Galant. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=209.36s)]
*  I speak with soldiers, with civilians, with hostages that were taken into Gaza and then [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=213.84s)]
*  later released as part of the November ceasefire deal with Hamas leadership, with Palestinian [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=218.24s)]
*  civilians, everyone involved on that dark day and the weeks that followed as the conflict [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=222.8s)]
*  erupted inside Gaza. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Remember what we are seeing today unfold along Israel's northern border is a direct result [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=229.52s)]
*  of the October 7th attack. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=234.70000000000002s)]
*  Black Saturday. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=236.48000000000002s)]
*  And one critical piece of information that I report in this book, four days after that [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=237.76000000000002s)]
*  brutal massacre, the Israelis had planned preemptive strikes against the Iran-backed [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=242.64s)]
*  group Hezbollah across Lebanon. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=247.92s)]
*  And I write about this in Black Saturday, Israeli jets were in the air before Israeli [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=250.32s)]
*  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu decided to call off those strikes. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=254.94s)]
*  And ultimately we've seen a war of attrition along this northern front following the October [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=259.28s)]
*  7th massacre and the war inside Gaza. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=263.96s)]
*  And Hezbollah says they've been involved in the conflict because they want to support [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=266.28s)]
*  the Palestinian people. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=269.84s)]
*  Now there are major questions about what comes next for the Middle East as the war [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=271.44s)]
*  in Gaza continues. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=274.96s)]
*  And of course, the northern front remains quite active as well. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=276.48s)]
*  Man shows you how relevant current events are still to that day, which is coming up [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=278.92s)]
*  on the one year anniversary. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=282.6s)]
*  You can watch Black Saturday with Trey Yanks on Fox Nation available on Monday and then [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=284.2s)]
*  preorder the book right now. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=288.36s)]
*  It comes out on Tuesday anywhere books are sold, but you can preorder at FoxNewsBooks.com. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qZyFVSrwBIA&t=289.68s)]
