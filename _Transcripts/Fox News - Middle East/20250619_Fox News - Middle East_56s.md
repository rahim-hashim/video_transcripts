# Trump considering 'bunker busters' to target Iranian nuclear sites: Report #shorts #usa #whitehouse
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA)
*  The situation room on the lower level of the West Wing is being prepared for President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=0.0s)]
*  Trump right now. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=4.1s)]
*  We expect him to be there about 25 minutes from now for the latest intelligence update. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=5.1000000000000005s)]
*  And we know that, recently in there, he has been asking intel and military advisers about [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=9.96s)]
*  these bunker buster bombs and whether or not they would actually be effective at destroying [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=15.5s)]
*  Iranian underground nuclear infrastructure. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=20.88s)]
*  That said, all options remain on the table, including diplomacy. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=24.580000000000002s)]
*  But we are finding out that it's pretty tough for these Iranian diplomats and negotiators [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=28.42s)]
*  who want to come to the White House next week to actually get out of Iran. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=33.86s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, they asked if they could come. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  We'll see if that happens. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=40.94s)]
*  It's not that easy for them to come. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=41.94s)]
*  They can't get out. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=43.660000000000004s)]
*  You know, they're in Iran. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=44.660000000000004s)]
*  And in one case, they want to come so badly, but he can't get out because there's bombs [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=47.22s)]
*  dropping all over the place. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwLbnox7uWA&t=51.42s)]
