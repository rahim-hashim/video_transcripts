# The Biden admin has 'given up the upper hand,' military expert warns
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E)
*  This morning, Israeli forces preparing for a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=0.0s)]
*  As Iran threatens, quote, far-reaching consequences if they don't stop that invasion immediately. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=6.88s)]
*  Our next guest knows all about fighting terror firsthand. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=13.56s)]
*  Retired Brigadier General Don Balduck served 10 tours in Afghanistan. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=15.8s)]
*  He joins us now. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=20.92s)]
*  General, thanks for being with us this morning. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=21.92s)]
*  No, at least on the surface, General, no huge advance overnight over the last 24 hours here [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=24.28s)]
*  in Israel. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=29.76s)]
*  As you see though the buildup, what do you feel like we should be anticipating? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=31.68s)]
*  Including, by the way, I would love to ask what you make of the United States positioning [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=36.0s)]
*  more resources there in the Mediterranean. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=39.44s)]
*  Well, thank you for having me this morning. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=41.92s)]
*  And my compliments to you, all three of you on laying out the problem set there. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=45.08s)]
*  I think you've done it very well. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=50.92s)]
*  And you have really articulated the problems that Israel is going to have. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=53.2s)]
*  You have a very competent combined arms conventional force going up against a loosely organized [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=56.6s)]
*  but motivated, and that's not a compliment to them, that's just what they are, loosely [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=62.92s)]
*  motivated organization that's going to use every terrorist tactic and unconventional [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=68.2s)]
*  warfare tactic they can use to include civilians, to include tunnels, to include these things. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=72.7s)]
*  And I've fought in these things personally. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=78.84s)]
*  The men and women I've commanded have, and it takes time. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=80.36s)]
*  This is not going to be short. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=84.22s)]
*  And Israel is going to have to use restraint because the international community is going [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=86.16s)]
*  to hold them accountable where they're not going to hold Hamas accountable, which is [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=89.16s)]
*  very unfortunate. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=93.24s)]
*  Nikki Haley has laid this out very well at the strategic level. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=94.8s)]
*  Quite frankly, the Biden administration's national security team is weak. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=99.03999999999999s)]
*  Congress is weak. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=103.19999999999999s)]
*  They have given the upper hand to the Iranians, to China, to Russia, to North Korea. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=104.56s)]
*  They've disrupted many regions of the world. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=109.56s)]
*  This is just another example of that. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=111.72s)]
*  They better be hard and fast diplomatically on Iran, warning them that there will be significant [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=114.4s)]
*  consequences if you get involved in this war. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=120.4s)]
*  We must support Israel's attack in there. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=126.8s)]
*  We must back them up. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=129.28s)]
*  We must support humanitarian assistance. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=130.84s)]
*  We must put pressure on the Arab countries to accept refugees, and we must handle it [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=133.66s)]
*  from inside that region, not outside the region. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=138.52s)]
*  The Biden administration has really given up the upper hand on this strategically. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=142.86s)]
*  Operationally, I think the military is moving in place as a warning to Iran, as a warning [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=148.66s)]
*  to others not to get involved. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=154.46s)]
*  That is probably prudent. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=156.5s)]
*  But if we had had a comprehensive national security strategy to both balance security [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=158.74s)]
*  at home and abroad in these critical areas, we wouldn't be in this position today. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=165.26s)]
*  But unfortunately, that has not happened. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=170.06s)]
*  Now it's time to get behind Israel and support them for however long it takes because they'll [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=171.94000000000003s)]
*  need to use restraint. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=177.02s)]
*  They're fighting an enemy that's unconventional, that will pull every dirty trick in the book, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=178.74s)]
*  and that unfortunately takes time. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=183.86s)]
*  How concerned are you, General, that should we get involved and Iran gets involved? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  Now, I mean, our military is pretty stretched. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=192.66000000000003s)]
*  We're in Ukraine. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=195.14000000000001s)]
*  China's on the move. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=196.74s)]
*  If this expands beyond Gaza, the Palestinians and the Israelis, and involves us in yet [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=198.58s)]
*  another front, another war, how concerned are you that we could even handle it? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=206.5s)]
*  I mean, our country's broke and our military recruitment is down. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=211.86s)]
*  Our weapons supplies are down. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  What do you say to people who are concerned about that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=218.94s)]
*  Well, I think it's a wake-up call to the American people that, you know, during the Biden administration, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=221.34s)]
*  our military has become extremely weak. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=227.54s)]
*  We've become overstretched. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=229.5s)]
*  Logistically, we could not support really a lot of things that would go on simultaneously [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=230.98s)]
*  in this world, which is unfortunate. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=236.89999999999998s)]
*  I would be very, very concerned. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=240.1s)]
*  Our military leadership is focused on everything but shoot, move, communicate, and survive [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=242.26s)]
*  on the battlefield and be able to fight and win America's wars. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=247.26s)]
*  We've seen that over the last few years. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=251.26s)]
*  It's become quite woke. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=253.01999999999998s)]
*  They can't recruit. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=254.5s)]
*  They can't retain. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=255.5s)]
*  It's this very serious problem for America in its national security apparatus. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=256.62s)]
*  So I'm very concerned about that. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=262.65999999999997s)]
*  And I know other national security folks are. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=264.46s)]
*  And we can't kid Americans about this. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=267.46s)]
*  We need to start telling them the truth, which we haven't been doing in a very long time, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=269.21999999999997s)]
*  because nobody really wants to hear the truth. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=273.34s)]
*  You know, we'd rather hear lies and be, you know, coddled than be told the truth about [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=274.97999999999996s)]
*  the stark realities of the world today and what it takes to secure a nation and what [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=280.58s)]
*  it takes to secure freedom and liberty. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=285.54s)]
*  And right now, America has given up the moral ground on that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=287.98s)]
*  America doesn't understand what right and wrong is. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=290.82s)]
*  And they're playing checkers when we should be playing chess. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=293.74s)]
*  And it's just really an unfortunate situation that we find ourselves in right now. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=298.58s)]
*  And so this is very important to contain this. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=303.94s)]
*  And we contain it by enforcing the Abraham Accords. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=307.38s)]
*  We contain it by putting more sanctions on Iran. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=310.58s)]
*  Stop them from giving oil to China. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=314.82s)]
*  Stop them from giving drones and missiles to Russia. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=317.18s)]
*  This is what we need to do. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=320.21999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=321.7s)]
*  Well, General Don Bolduc, thank you for your time this morning. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=322.7s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfnsBc36z0E&t=325.26s)]
