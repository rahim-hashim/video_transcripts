# America is indirectly 'funding' Russian war machine through China relationship
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 19, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k)
*  Here now is Mike Pompeo, former secretary of state, Fox News contributor. Mr. Secretary, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=0.0s)]
*  great to see you tonight. We said from the beginning, and I know you did as well, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=4.8s)]
*  that if this administration was really serious about crippling the Russian war effort, [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=8.4s)]
*  they wouldn't be funding it through the back door by continuing to do huge business with China. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  Laura, thanks for having me on. That's exactly right. Not only are we funding it, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=21.04s)]
*  they've stolen the intellectual property that's the basis for those very semiconductors and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=25.84s)]
*  microelectronics that you described. They stole them from places like South Dakota and North Dakota. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=30.0s)]
*  The woman you were just speaking to transferred it, dumped it back here in the United States, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=34.16s)]
*  and are now selling it to Vladimir Putin so his war machine can continue to expand. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=38.24s)]
*  These are hard problems, but this administration has no plan, no strategy. They're not willing to [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=43.519999999999996s)]
*  confront the hard truth that the partnership that Xi Jinping in China calls unlimited. He says, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=47.760000000000005s)]
*  we're unlimited friends. They're unwilling to confront the challenge that that presents. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=53.6s)]
*  Be serious about this. I promise you, if an American company was trying to buy an agricultural [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=58.16s)]
*  piece of property near a Chinese military base in Beijing, it wouldn't happen. Yet we're naive. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=62.96s)]
*  We are silly about the way we think about protecting the American people. We have to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=68.24s)]
*  understand that the Chinese Communist Party didn't come here for a good, benign, noble purpose. They [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=72.8s)]
*  came here to conduct espionage and reduce the capacity for the United States to stand on its [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=78.08s)]
*  own two feet. Mr. Secretary, there is bipartisan support, as Beth just said. There is bipartisan [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=82.64s)]
*  support for stopping this. So if Republicans take back the House, we don't know what's going to [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=89.2s)]
*  happen in the Senate. We're going to talk to Dr. Oz in a moment from Pennsylvania. But if they take [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=94.4s)]
*  back the House, they have to stop this. They have to stop talking about it and stop it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=99.2s)]
*  Absolutely, Laura. And they have the ability to do it. There's legislation now, which we're going [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=106.56s)]
*  to try and bring some semiconductors back from China, back from Taiwan, back to manufacture here [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=110.16s)]
*  inside the United States. They can put language in that very piece of legislation that would [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=115.11999999999999s)]
*  prevent precisely the kind of transaction that's taking place in North Dakota. And Laura, you should [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=119.44s)]
*  know this isn't a one-off. They are free to move about the cabinet. They did the same thing with [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=123.52s)]
*  a company called Smithfield in Kansas that was making pork. The Chinese are doing this all across [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  the country. We have to stop it, and Congress has the capacity to do that. One to ten, rating ten, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=132.88s)]
*  ten being the best performance of Biden in the Middle East. How do you rate Biden's performance, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=139.2s)]
*  Mr. Secretary? Oh, you know, Laura, I do my best to be generous. Did you say one was best? It's a, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=143.92s)]
*  if one is best, this is a nine and a half. Now, one is worse. This is a bad performance. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=150.0s)]
*  Yeah, one is worse. Ten is the best. Yeah, well, you're being very generous. This is the worst [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  performance by an American president in the Middle East in decades and decades. It was truly [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=160.64s)]
*  unfortunate. Makes us less safe. No, that's the most important thing. It's not like that it's [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=164.32s)]
*  funny or the fist bump. It makes us less safe. Mr. Secretary, thank you. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUE9btJU33k&t=169.2s)]
