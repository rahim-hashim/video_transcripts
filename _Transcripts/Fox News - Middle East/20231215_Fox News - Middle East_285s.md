# Michael Waltz warns Biden's 'feckless Iran policy' could lead to this
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs)
*  In case you're counting about 92 attacks on U.S. soldiers, the latest seem to be coming [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=0.0s)]
*  from Iran-sponsored Hootie Rebels launching drone attacks on forces. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=5.96s)]
*  Congressman Michael Walz of Florida joins us right now. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=11.44s)]
*  His take on all of this. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=14.24s)]
*  As you heard, Congressman, they're saying, don't even think about forming this task force [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=15.4s)]
*  in the Red Sea. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=19.42s)]
*  What would you do? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=21.06s)]
*  Well, Neil, as a commander-in-chief, as a leader of the free world, the president needs [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=22.8s)]
*  to look at the camera, look at the American people, look at the world and say, Iran, we [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=29.7s)]
*  are going to hold you directly responsible. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=36.42s)]
*  You will pay a price. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=39.74s)]
*  There will be a cost for what the Hooties do and for what your proxies in Iraq are doing [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=41.46s)]
*  in attacking American soldiers. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=49.06s)]
*  And they have to believe it. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=51.6s)]
*  Neil, that's the problem. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=52.86s)]
*  We have multiple aircraft carriers. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=54.06s)]
*  We have destroyers, frigates, submarines, soldiers, bombers. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=55.82s)]
*  You can have the most capable military in the world, but if your adversaries don't [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=59.64s)]
*  believe you have the political will to impose costs on them directly, then they're going [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=63.96s)]
*  to keep doing what they're doing, which is attacking U.S. interests and U.S. sailors [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=69.06s)]
*  in the Red Sea and our allies. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=75.16s)]
*  And oh, by the way, the Hootie spokesperson just effectively announced a blockade on Israel [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=76.88s)]
*  by attacking international shipping, and they're doing it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=83.24000000000001s)]
*  And what are we doing in response? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=86.76s)]
*  Well, we've allowed our military to defend themselves by shooting down the missiles, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=88.6s)]
*  but they're not allowed to shoot the shooters, which are the Hootie missile launchers, much [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=94.2s)]
*  less do anything to Iran itself. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=98.98s)]
*  And until we punch the bully in the nose, just continuing to offer it more and more [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=102.62s)]
*  lunch money is only going to make the bully more aggressive. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=107.56s)]
*  And that's what we're seeing. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=111.72s)]
*  And my fear, Neil, and I can't say this more clearly, is that some poor sailor or some [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=113.16s)]
*  poor soldier is going to die before this administration reverses course on its feckless Iran policy. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=119.47999999999999s)]
*  Are you saying that we cannot go after these Hootie encampments themselves, the rebels [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  themselves? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=133.8s)]
*  I mean, they are a proxy group for Iran. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=134.8s)]
*  I can understand the skepticism and fear of going after Iran on Iranian territory, but [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=136.64s)]
*  holding back even when we go after these Hootie rebels because we have shot down some of their [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=141.88000000000002s)]
*  drones or does it end there? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=147.96s)]
*  Yeah, but shooting down there, if someone's shooting at you, you don't shoot the bullets. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=150.20000000000002s)]
*  You shoot the shooter to defend yourself. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=155.34s)]
*  Right, in the Navy, they call it the archer and the arrow. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=158.0s)]
*  Right now, they're authorized to shoot the arrow, not the archer. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=161.86s)]
*  So if we're not even taking action on the proxies doing the shooting, look, Iran will [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=167.4s)]
*  trade Hootie lives for the lives of American sailors all day long. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=173.08s)]
*  You've got to do what Ronald Reagan did, which is take action on Iran. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=178.74s)]
*  In 1988, when the Iranians mined the Gulf, not only was it hitting international shipping, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=182.4s)]
*  it hit one of our ships. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=190.04000000000002s)]
*  What did we do in response? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=191.56s)]
*  We didn't take out the mines. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=192.82s)]
*  We sank five Iranian ships, and then it stopped. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=195.48s)]
*  Under President Trump, we took out the Iranian field general, not their proxies, Soleimani, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=198.35999999999999s)]
*  the Iranian field general, and then it stopped. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=204.51999999999998s)]
*  You have to restore peace. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=207.88s)]
*  Sometimes you have to escalate to de-escalate. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=210.39999999999998s)]
*  And for reasons that are unclear to me, except for an appeasement strategy, this administration [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  has been deterred by Iran, and they're afraid to do it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=218.6s)]
*  What are the Arab nations doing, though, for whom this Red Sea International Water Passageway [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=222.0s)]
*  is crucial as well? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=227.39999999999998s)]
*  Are they just sitting idly by and waiting for us, or what? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=229.2s)]
*  Well, I don't think the—I don't know that the Arabs are going to necessarily step in. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=232.88s)]
*  Remember, both the Saudis and the UAE were in a very difficult military conflict down [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  in Yemen, where the Hooties are. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=244.82s)]
*  That's one. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=246.32s)]
*  I don't know that they're going to step in to protect shipping going to Israel, but I'll [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=247.32s)]
*  remind everyone, 15 to 20 percent of global shipping flows through the Red Sea and through [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=251.44s)]
*  the Suez Canal. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=257.68s)]
*  So really, this is an attack on the global economy. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=258.68s)]
*  Including some of theirs. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=261.68s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=262.68s)]
*  It's in their vested interest to do that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=263.68s)]
*  We've got to take more aggressive action. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=264.68s)]
*  We have to, before someone truly gets hurt. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=265.76s)]
*  All right, Congressman, thank you. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=269.68s)]
*  Very good catching up with you. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PrpQmWYGSFs&t=271.36s)]
