# Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters descend on DC
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg)
*  Israel can go to hell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=0.0s)]
*  There you go. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=7.0s)]
*  The world is upside down. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=19.88s)]
*  The big weekend show begins with a Fox News alert. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=21.16s)]
*  Hello everyone. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=24.16s)]
*  We're live in Washington D.C. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=25.32s)]
*  with Joe Kennedy along with Raymond Arroyo, Alicia Cunha and Joe Concha. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=26.32s)]
*  The big story tonight, tens of thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters flooding the streets [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=29.32s)]
*  of our nation's capital. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=36.44s)]
*  Many of them spewing anti-Semitic tropes and hate as they make calls for the total destruction [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=38.16s)]
*  and annihilation of Israel. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=44.400000000000006s)]
*  Mike Emanuel live in the center of it all in Washington D.C. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=46.8s)]
*  Mike. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=50.96s)]
*  Hi, Kennedy. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=51.96s)]
*  A massive protest here in our nation's capital calling for a ceasefire in the Middle East, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=53.76s)]
*  also calling for the United States to stop sending aid to Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=58.76s)]
*  Earlier, I caught up with a protester from Toledo, Ohio. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=62.56s)]
*  They're killing kids, women. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=66.36s)]
*  I mean, they're pretty much bombing everything. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=69.36s)]
*  This is not a war. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=73.36s)]
*  War is a military against military, but this is against humanity, period. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=75.36s)]
*  And we know we were just hoping that the aid will completely stop. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=80.76s)]
*  Many of these people have been out here yelling and marching all afternoon now into the evening, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=88.76s)]
*  people bussed in by pro-Palestinian groups and some anti-war organizations from places [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=94.68s)]
*  like Chicago and across the Midwest. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=100.44s)]
*  We've heard chanting of free, free Palestine, ceasefire now. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=103.0s)]
*  And even some references to the president calling him Genocide Joe. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=107.44000000000001s)]
*  One protester told us she doesn't believe Biden administration calls for humanitarian [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=113.72s)]
*  pauses in the Israeli military operation. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  It's little more than lip service, in my opinion. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=122.4s)]
*  They're getting lots of calls, lots of emails, lots of realization that a lot of people probably [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=125.12s)]
*  aren't going to vote for him next year and he wants to do something to save his campaign. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=130.4s)]
*  People aren't going to be appeased by that. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=137.44s)]
*  This certainly appears to be the largest expression of pro-Palestinian support since the conflict [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=140.44s)]
*  began last month. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=145.88s)]
*  We haven't heard official crowd numbers, but it is a doozy. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=147.88s)]
*  Kennedy? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=151.88s)]
*  Mike, thank you so much. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=153.88s)]
*  Great reporting. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=155.88s)]
*  And it is wild what is happening in D.C. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=156.88s)]
*  Raymond, so let me ask you this, because one of the things that comes to mind, of course, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=160.88s)]
*  is the January 6th, you know, the rally that turned into the crush in the capital. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=166.44s)]
*  Are there comparisons here? [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=172.44s)]
*  We're seeing a very similar map, people visiting the capital from all across the country. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=174.44s)]
*  Well, a lot of these people were bussed in. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=179.44s)]
*  There are pro-Palestinian groups from around the country that concentrated folks here to [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=181.44s)]
*  build up their numbers and make a show of force. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=187.44s)]
*  Here's the problem with this. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=190.44s)]
*  Joe and I, all of us were talking about this earlier. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=192.44s)]
*  The pressures you're seeing here, I have never seen people this close to the White House gates. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=196.2s)]
*  That's verboten, particularly since the Trump administration, we saw, you know, the crowds [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=201.2s)]
*  coming out of the George Floyd protests. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=206.2s)]
*  They have a perimeter around the White House. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=209.2s)]
*  So how this is happening now, I don't understand. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=211.2s)]
*  But what you're seeing is an expression of rage, anti-Palestinian and anti-Jew hate at [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=214.2s)]
*  a level that I've never seen before, never thought I'd see. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=222.2s)]
*  I just want to quickly read this. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=225.95999999999998s)]
*  President Obama, former President Obama, gave an interview to Pod Save America. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=227.95999999999998s)]
*  Here's what he said. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=232.95999999999998s)]
*  This is today. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=233.95999999999998s)]
*  What Hamas did was horrific and there's no justification for it. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=234.95999999999998s)]
*  And what is also true is the occupation and what's happening to Palestine and Palestinians [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=237.95999999999998s)]
*  is unbearable. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=245.95999999999998s)]
*  This moral equivalency coming out of the White House and the former president is justifying [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  what you're seeing on the street. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=254.72s)]
*  There is no moral equivalency here. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=255.72s)]
*  You have a land dispute, settle it in the diplomatic quarters. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=256.72s)]
*  You don't get to behead people and kill innocent civilians to make your point. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=260.72s)]
*  So I'm sorry. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=265.72s)]
*  These protests are off base. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=266.72s)]
*  They should be protesting for peace, not for the Palestinians, i.e. Hamas, who started [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=268.72s)]
*  this entire rage and hatred and bloodshed that we're now seeing in the Middle East. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=275.72s)]
*  But there's also a normalization and a justification of it. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=280.72s)]
*  I want to take a look at something Joe Rogan said. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=283.48s)]
*  I know you and I both have teenagers and college age kids, so maybe it's starting there and [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=285.48s)]
*  bleeding onto the streets. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=291.48s)]
*  Let's take a look. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=292.48s)]
*  It's very strange to see massive protests on the streets that are yelling out in support [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=293.48s)]
*  of the people that did that on October 7th. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=301.48s)]
*  The fact that there's people that are so f***ing detached from reality and they have this very [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=304.48s)]
*  strange, leftist, Marxist philosophy that is so untenable with the reality of the world [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=313.48s)]
*  and yet they're teaching kids this. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=320.98s)]
*  And then they're talking about this openly. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=323.48s)]
*  It's so dangerous. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=326.48s)]
*  And for young people that admire those people or that are being taught by those people and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=328.48s)]
*  don't know any better, I never thought things would deteriorate this rapidly. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=331.8s)]
*  Do you agree, Alicia? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=335.28000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it's really frightening. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=337.28000000000003s)]
*  Earlier today on Fox News Live, I was talking to Sabrina Soffer. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=339.84s)]
*  She's a student there. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=342.84s)]
*  She's Jewish. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=345.84s)]
*  She's a junior at George Washington University. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=346.84s)]
*  Her mother, who lives in California, has asked her not to go to class because of the protests, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=349.84s)]
*  because of the anti-Semitic messages that have been blasted up on the library that we've [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=355.11999999999995s)]
*  seen there. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=358.91999999999996s)]
*  And what's so scary is that you have everyday Americans not allowed to live their everyday [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=360.03999999999996s)]
*  lives anymore because they don't feel safe. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=365.67999999999995s)]
*  Your parents don't feel safe. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=368.92s)]
*  And I don't blame the mom for telling her you can't go to school, but that really interrupts [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=369.92s)]
*  her freedom as an American. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=375.04s)]
*  Yes, you don't have freedom of association. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=377.04s)]
*  You don't have freedom of expression. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=379.48s)]
*  You don't have freedom to exercise your religion if you've got a massive section of the population [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=381.24s)]
*  that's essentially siding with terrorists. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=390.12s)]
*  I'm blown away by that story. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=392.72s)]
*  Remember back in college, UCLA, NYU, Maryland? [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=394.56s)]
*  Northern Arizona University. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=399.0s)]
*  Northern Arizona, very cool place. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=402.0s)]
*  So cool I can't remember. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=404.2s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=405.2s)]
*  But that's supposed to be idyllic. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=406.2s)]
*  You're the happiest time of your life. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=408.2s)]
*  The last thing you're thinking about is that you shouldn't go to class because it may be [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=409.2s)]
*  dangerous for you. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=412.91999999999996s)]
*  That's something that blows me away. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=414.59999999999997s)]
*  Joe Rogan said something that was very profound, where he said that this is what they're teaching [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=416.15999999999997s)]
*  kids now. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=420.24s)]
*  And then you look at polls. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=421.36s)]
*  Is that true? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=422.68s)]
*  Well, Harvard-Harris. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=424.28000000000003s)]
*  Those between the ages of 18 and 24. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=425.28000000000003s)]
*  Who do you side with more in this conflict? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=426.92s)]
*  52% Israel, 48% Hamas. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  It's basically a clean split. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=433.6s)]
*  When you ask those between 25 and 54, support for Israel goes up to 82%, where it should [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=435.52s)]
*  be, or 95%. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=440.88s)]
*  This anti-Israel slant is something that we're seeing in American universities. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=443.48s)]
*  We're still seeing it in the media, by the way. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=446.44s)]
*  Associated Press, Reuters, all these major news organizations keep citing debt tolls [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=448.48s)]
*  from the Gaza Health Ministry, which is H-A-M-A-S. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=452.48s)]
*  It's Hamas, and they trust the numbers, and that only pushes the propaganda. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=457.8s)]
*  So it seems to become from all sides, Gannady. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=461.52s)]
*  It is coming from all sides. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=463.56s)]
*  And the anti-Semitism, and if you're in New York, and we all are, you see this with your [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=465.12s)]
*  own eyes. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=470.84s)]
*  You bet. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=471.84s)]
*  I was walking down the street, and there was a guy walking down the street yelling, F the [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=472.84s)]
*  Jews, kill the Jews. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=475.76s)]
*  And I was like, what did you just say? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=477.42s)]
*  Because he was a little like, I could have taken him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=478.96s)]
*  We didn't get an aphesified, but it wouldn't have ended well for him. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  I would have paid for that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=484.76s)]
*  I don't believe in violence, but he got me really riled up. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=485.76s)]
*  And then a good friend of mine was almost run over in a crosswalk by one of those trucks [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=488.96s)]
*  displaying very anti-Semitic tropes, calling for the death of Jews, like on his truck, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=493.88s)]
*  just driving around. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=501.08s)]
*  Who would have imagined we would see this in New York City, a city so rich in its Jewish [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=502.08s)]
*  heritage, so many Jews here who live here and are part of building this great city. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=506.44s)]
*  But I have to tell you, what we're seeing at these universities, this is not a mistake. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=511.76s)]
*  What we are seeing is people say, well, this is their free speech. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=516.24s)]
*  You keep hearing that from all of these university heads. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=519.12s)]
*  No, it is not free speech. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=521.72s)]
*  This is program speech. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=523.7s)]
*  The school chose, selected these individuals to be part of their community. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=525.18s)]
*  The application process is what got us here, because they gave preference to whom? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=530.24s)]
*  People from certain regions and with certain beliefs, and they weren't necessarily Jewish [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=536.2s)]
*  beliefs or Judeo-Christian beliefs. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=540.36s)]
*  That is why you see a preponderance of this hate, this one-sided bias coming out of the [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=543.08s)]
*  university setting, because it was programmed that way. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=549.36s)]
*  So it's not a surprise. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=553.08s)]
*  It shouldn't be a surprise, but it needs real reform. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=554.1600000000001s)]
*  And I do think a lot of this is rooted in communism, if not democratic socialism. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=556.8000000000001s)]
*  And they're calling for the annihilation of Zionism. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=562.52s)]
*  It's like, well, that actually includes Christianity. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=566.52s)]
*  So let's take a look at the map, because as you can see, it's people from not just around [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=569.52s)]
*  DC, not just the Eastern seaboard, but across the country. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=576.32s)]
*  You've got New Mexico. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=582.4799999999999s)]
*  You've got Minnesota and Missouri, all representing Indiana, some of my fellow Hoosiers, traveling [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=585.04s)]
*  to DC for this rally. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=596.04s)]
*  What are they trying to accomplish? [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=599.88s)]
*  Because it's interesting, Lisa, they're calling our president Genocide Joe, but they're also [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  calling for the destruction of Israel. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=605.62s)]
*  I don't think that they want Israel to be set up somewhere else, like a pop-up shop [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=608.72s)]
*  in another part of the world. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=614.88s)]
*  They want the extermination of the people who live in Israel who happen to be Jewish. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=616.84s)]
*  Yes, and actually, when we're watching those protests in Mike Emanuel, they're in DC. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=620.84s)]
*  Which is genocide. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=625.84s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=626.84s)]
*  And he's there, and he's asking questions and trying to press them. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=627.84s)]
*  It's really difficult to get a specific answer to see if they specifically know what they're [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=630.5600000000001s)]
*  talking about. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=634.32s)]
*  And they start to refer to history. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=635.32s)]
*  The question is, well, at what point in history does your idea begin? [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=637.2s)]
*  Because there's something else that comes before that. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  And I don't think folks are paying attention to the details because it's not convenient. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=644.0s)]
*  Yes, and there are many people who are protesting in this country, and if they actually went [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=648.6s)]
*  to Gaza and unfurled their flags, they would meet a swift end, sadly. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=654.0s)]
*  Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=659.72s)]
*  I feel like we're going through that right now. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=661.8800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, we certainly are. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=663.6800000000001s)]
*  The world truly is, to Joe Rogan's point, it's upside down. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=665.24s)]
*  You are watching people espouse things, and these were formally rational people not long [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=668.76s)]
*  ago. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=675.12s)]
*  And the things that they are saying, the things that they are calling for, it is unconscionable. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZy5I7qYuGg&t=676.12s)]
