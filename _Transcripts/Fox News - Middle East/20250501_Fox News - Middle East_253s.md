# Hegseth sends BOLD warning to Iran over Houthis: 'You were warned'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc)
*  Defense Secretary Pete Hegsath sending a very strong warning to Iran over its backing of the Houthi terrorists in Yemen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=0.0s)]
*  The Defense Secretary posting on X, we see your lethal support to the Houthis. We know exactly what you're doing. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=8.0s)]
*  You know very well what the U.S. military is capable of and you were warned. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=15.0s)]
*  You will pay the consequence at the time and place of our choosing. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=20.0s)]
*  Managing Director of Beacon Global Strategies, Michael Allen joins me now. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=24.0s)]
*  Michael, good morning to you. So what a tightrope walk. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=28.0s)]
*  Diplomatic talks with Iran on one hand and then this warning from the Defense Secretary on the other. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=31.0s)]
*  But when it comes to a social media post like this, does Iran take a message like that lightly or will they actually change their behavior as a result of what the Defense Secretary just said? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=35.0s)]
*  So I'm not so sure they're going to change their behavior yet. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=47.0s)]
*  If the Secretary, however, is signaling that we might try and hit some Iranian assets or ships or trainers in the region, I don't think they're going to hit inside of Iran. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=52.0s)]
*  But if they were to try and hit someone around Yemen, then I think that might get the Iranians attention. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=64.0s)]
*  I think it might benefit us in the longer run on diplomatic efforts, not only with Iran nuclear, but trying to get some sort of handle on what's going on with the Houthis. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=71.0s)]
*  Yeah, and when it comes to the Houthis, the U.K. just carried out its first joint operation with the United States against the Houthis since President Trump reentered office and reports are that that mission was successful. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=83.0s)]
*  So that's good news there. But there was other big news that took place yesterday, Michael, when it comes to the minerals deal. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=94.0s)]
*  The United States and Ukraine finally signed that rare earths minerals deal. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=100.0s)]
*  And this is coming at a time when President Trump is becoming increasingly frustrated with Vladimir Putin for prolonging this war. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=104.0s)]
*  So when it comes to the substance of the minerals deal, tell us a little bit more about that, what the United States gets out of it and how Ukraine benefits as a result of this as well. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=112.0s)]
*  You bet. I think for new efforts at production of critical minerals and even hydrocarbons, we will jointly invest or there will be in the dollars that will invest into the country. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=123.0s)]
*  And eventually the proceeds will go to helping fund Ukraine's effort to have military assistance, which ultimately is absolutely necessary to deter an eventual Russian reinvasion. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=136.0s)]
*  And over time, as these new projects yield honestly a return, the United States will benefit from those particular financial comebacks. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=150.0s)]
*  So that's good for us. This is sort of delivers on what Donald Trump said about putting America first. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=160.0s)]
*  It helps us get paid back for the support that we give the Ukrainians. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=166.0s)]
*  And it gives us an economic state in critical minerals that we absolutely need for the military, for batteries here in the United States and other advanced manufacturing capabilities. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=170.0s)]
*  So I do agree with the president. I think it's a win win situation and it's something he should be proud of. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=182.0s)]
*  And I think it ultimately helps with deterrence and security in Europe, which is something that we're looking for. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=189.0s)]
*  Yeah, we now have a vested economic interest in Ukraine, which is great for the Ukrainians. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=195.0s)]
*  And when it comes to the United States, we're talking about rare earths, minerals. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=200.0s)]
*  So I'm sure that this news and signing this deal with something that China, when they learned of this, was none too pleased. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=204.0s)]
*  I think you're right. We're too dependent upon the Chinese for these types of rare earth minerals. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=212.0s)]
*  And I think it's great that President Trump has put this at the top of his agenda. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=218.0s)]
*  He's trying to make sure we can get these minerals here in the United States if we can. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=222.0s)]
*  He wants to make sure we could get it even from Greenland. You hear him talk about that. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=226.0s)]
*  But going with Ukraine in this particular instance is a smart move strategically for the United States. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=231.0s)]
*  Yeah, it certainly has good news all around. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=237.0s)]
*  Michael, thank you so much for waking up early with us this morning. We appreciate your insight, as always. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q1JQdJzelhc&t=239.0s)]
