# Houthi's designations are 'meaningless,' says former CENTCOM spox
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM)
*  The Gaza war now expanding across the region. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=0.0s)]
*  The U.S. just struck down another Houthi anti-ship missile in the seventh round of strikes against [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  the terrorist group since last Thursday. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=7.68s)]
*  Defense officials at both the State Department and the Pentagon have been quick to emphasize [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=9.84s)]
*  in recent days that these are all defensive strikes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=13.56s)]
*  For more on this, let's bring in retired Colonel Joe Buccino. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=16.96s)]
*  He joins me now, a former spokesperson for CENTCOM. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=19.28s)]
*  Colonel, first off, what do you make of this sort of late-in-the-game military response [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=22.96s)]
*  by the DOD to Houthi rebels in Yemen who have been firing strikes on U.S. forces across [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=29.8s)]
*  the Middle East now for the better part of two months? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=37.28s)]
*  What I make of it, Jillian, is that it's not working. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=41.28s)]
*  These strikes, the Houthi strikes continue. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=43.6s)]
*  The Houthi strikes on commercial shipping continue. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=46.22s)]
*  And if you think about it this way, Jillian, this is a motorcycle gang in one of the poorest [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=49.24s)]
*  countries on earth, a failed state in Yemen that's run out of water, and they are holding [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=53.88s)]
*  global commerce at risk. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=58.4s)]
*  In fact, they're contributing to global inflation. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=60.36s)]
*  So these strikes are not working. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=64.02s)]
*  Iran can continue to replenish the stocks there in Yemen, as they did, as they have [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=66.48s)]
*  been for almost a decade when the Saudis were bombing the Houthis. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=70.28s)]
*  And so this tit-for-tat back and forth is going to continue. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=73.96000000000001s)]
*  To that point, take a listen to National Security Council spokesman John Kirby yesterday in [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=78.08s)]
*  the White House briefing. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=84.08s)]
*  This morning, U.S. forces conducted three successful self-defense strikes against Houthi [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=86.96000000000001s)]
*  targets in Yemen. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=91.0s)]
*  This is the fourth preemptive action that the U.S. military has taken in the past week [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=92.66s)]
*  against Houthi missile launchers that were ready to launch attacks, in this case anti-ship [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=98.36s)]
*  missiles. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=104.48s)]
*  CENTCOM, Central Command, will have more details on this a little bit later, but as you know, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=105.48s)]
*  there are U.S. Navy ships in the Red Sea as well as international shipping. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  These actions were, I want to stress again, done in self-defense. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=115.04s)]
*  Now, when it comes to strikes on Houthi operatives, the common refrain out of the White House [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=117.96000000000001s)]
*  the last couple of weeks have been, these are defensive moves, going to great lengths [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=124.16000000000001s)]
*  to emphasize that in press briefings. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=130.20000000000002s)]
*  But then they also describe these strikes on Houthi targets as preemptive. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  How can both, can you square that? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=137.16s)]
*  I cannot. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=139.88s)]
*  And you know, John Kirby's a great friend of mine, a great patriot and a great mentor [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=140.88s)]
*  for me, but these strikes are all defensive in nature. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=144.4s)]
*  In other words, we're knocking their missiles out of the sky and then hitting their missile [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=148.35999999999999s)]
*  sites, their radar sites on the coast of Yemen. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=152.84s)]
*  So in short, they're not preemptive. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=155.04s)]
*  They're not preemptive. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=156.72s)]
*  And they're also a little bit meaningless because the more we strike these coastal battery [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=158.4s)]
*  sites, the more we hit their missiles, the more we hit their radars, the more Iran flushes [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=164.24s)]
*  those things back in, pushes that stuff back in. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=168.36s)]
*  And so it's not really having the effect that we would like. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=171.62s)]
*  You know, the administration does not want to raise up, does not want to escalate this [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=175.14000000000001s)]
*  thing and doesn't want to widen the war. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=178.70000000000002s)]
*  The problem is we've got to do something about the Red Sea to get commercial shipping through [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=180.58s)]
*  there. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=185.02s)]
*  So the Houthis may have started out, as you mentioned, to go as a gang, but they're now [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=186.02s)]
*  very well financed by Iran, the Iranian government. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=188.8s)]
*  The Trump administration had designated these people a foreign terrorist organization. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=194.46s)]
*  It's a designation that President Biden removed when he came to office three years ago. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=200.38s)]
*  This week, interestingly, the administration redesignated them with a sort of lesser label, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=206.18s)]
*  SGDT. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=213.70000000000002s)]
*  It's a sort of, it's been described by experts as like a watered down version of a terrorist [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=215.5s)]
*  designation. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=220.38s)]
*  What do you make, if anything, of that decision? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=221.62s)]
*  Does it make sense to you? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=224.3s)]
*  To be fair, the Trump administration labeled them as a terrorist group only at the very [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=226.06s)]
*  end. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=229.94s)]
*  For most of Trump's time in office, they were not labeled, the Houthis were not labeled [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=230.94s)]
*  as a terrorist group. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=234.38s)]
*  These things are basically meaningless. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=235.82000000000002s)]
*  Both of these labels are basically meaningless. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=237.88s)]
*  You're talking about economic sanctions and economic holds, and it's not as though the [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=239.82000000000002s)]
*  Houthis own stock in the New York Stock Exchange. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=245.02s)]
*  OK? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=247.54000000000002s)]
*  So these things don't really have some great deal of power over the Houthis. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  We're kind of with a half measure here. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=253.22s)]
*  OK. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=256.26s)]
*  We went, as you identified, they were not identified as an FTO, Foreign Terrorist Organization, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=257.26s)]
*  so people can't be prosecuted all over the world for contributing to the Houthis. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=263.22s)]
*  Nonetheless, these things really are, it's more of a political label and a messaging [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=268.3s)]
*  aspect to this. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=272.9s)]
*  Now, there is reporting out there this week that under the new designation, Houthi terrorists [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=273.9s)]
*  could still potentially apply for U.S. visas and travel to the United States. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=279.18s)]
*  I asked the State Department spokesman about that two days ago. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=283.74s)]
*  Take a listen to what he said. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=286.74s)]
*  I don't think you should expect that any Houthi operative who applies for a visa to travel [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=289.06s)]
*  into the United States is going to see that visa approved any time in the near future, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=292.98s)]
*  to say the least. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=296.54s)]
*  I asked him by what mechanism they could guarantee that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=299.18s)]
*  He said he'd have to get back to us. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=302.54s)]
*  Do you feel confident that Houthi operatives won't be able to make their way to the United [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=305.34s)]
*  States? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=310.78s)]
*  I do not, just because we don't know who in Yemen is part of the Houthis, who in Yemen [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=311.78s)]
*  is not part of the Houthis, who's supporting them, who is part of their large group, who's [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=316.82s)]
*  part of their financing network. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=321.32s)]
*  The Houthis have kind of spread out all aspects of life in Yemen. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=323.05999999999995s)]
*  They're the garbage man. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=327.62s)]
*  They keep the water running. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=329.7s)]
*  They teach kids in school. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=331.47999999999996s)]
*  It's not just the military component in Yemen that's part of the Houthis. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=334.1s)]
*  So it's hard to know in Yemen who is contributing to the Houthis, who's supporting the Houthis, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=336.62s)]
*  and who is an actual Houthi operative. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=341.14000000000004s)]
*  Under this half measure that you identified, the half measure, not the full FTO, Foreign [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=343.58000000000004s)]
*  Terrorist Organization, there really is no full mechanism to identify who's a Houthi [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=347.78000000000003s)]
*  and to stop them from coming into this country. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=352.82000000000005s)]
*  Well, that's alarming. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=354.98s)]
*  Colonel Baccino, thanks so much for coming in today, joining us live on set. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=355.98s)]
*  Great to see you. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VqGJcwrsgM&t=359.78000000000003s)]
