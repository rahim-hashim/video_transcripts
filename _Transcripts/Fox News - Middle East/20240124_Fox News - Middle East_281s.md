# Gen. Keane: Israel facing a difficult, new reality
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q)
*  So the US carrying out these strikes against Hezbollah targets. These are running proxies in Iraq. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Stirring up new fears, the hostilities may spread. If anything else, they're not damping down. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=4.88s)]
*  And General Jack Keene's here on that. General, nice to see you and good morning to you. We had [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=10.4s)]
*  to do something, right? We had our own people hit in this latest round, but you could argue [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=13.6s)]
*  right now that we're hitting Hezbollah and the Houthi rebels at the same time. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=20.96s)]
*  Where do you see this going? How do you see it now? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, well, certainly responding in kind was the right thing to do. We have to recognize that [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=26.4s)]
*  Khatib Hezbollah, which is the Iranian-backed militia group inside of Iraq, they are armed, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  trained and funded by the Iranians. And obviously, shooting advanced weapon systems in terms of [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=43.2s)]
*  ballistic missiles is something Iran has provided to them, has also provided to the Hezbollah in [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=50.88s)]
*  Lebanon and also to the Houthis in Yemen. So I applaud the administration for doing something [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  about it, certainly, and trying to take out the capabilities that Khatib Hezbollah has, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=65.60000000000001s)]
*  much as we're doing the same thing with the Houthis. But until we go to the center of gravity [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=70.4s)]
*  and deal with Iran, change the strategic framework that we have with them, recognize that [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=75.68s)]
*  diplomatic appeasement and negotiation has not worked. We need to isolate Iran internationally, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=82.32000000000001s)]
*  economically. We really got to go back to the full-throttle sanctions and come forward to the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  Congress and the American people and tell us what the comprehensive sanctions are that the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  administration says they're imposing, because the evidence does not support it. Iran is flush [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=99.76s)]
*  with oil money. And the third thing is we have to deal with Iran militarily. Limited, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=105.68s)]
*  measured attacks, certainly, against the IRGC training centers, bases, leaders. And also, [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  I think, with the Israelis, we need to continue the espionage and sabotage programs that were [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=119.84s)]
*  so successful in the summer of 2020, when they took down the Natanz facility in terms of its [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=126.64000000000001s)]
*  advanced centrifuges and set the program back nine months to a year. We need to reset comprehensively [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=133.52s)]
*  to deal with Iran and recognize that the expansion of the war, Bill, is being driven by Iran [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=141.12s)]
*  in directing their proxies to do that very same thing. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=149.12s)]
*  – Yeah. One of the many things on the list during this election cycle, when you think about it, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=152.64000000000001s)]
*  how many things can this administration straighten out in the next 10 months? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  And do they have the right team to do it? It's a fair question to be asked going forward. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=161.6s)]
*  Now, quickly, in southern Gaza, with 24 Israeli soldiers dead, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  do you believe they were getting close to the Amas leader? [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=170.56s)]
*  – I'm not sure. Where we are, really, is in northern Gaza, the troops there, a number of [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=173.12s)]
*  brigades have left. The troops that are there are in a hold position, making certain that they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=184.16s)]
*  maintain the territory that they've taken, and they're also beginning to establish the buffer [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=189.28s)]
*  zone there like they are in other places. In the south, the clearing operation systematically [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  is still going on. The air bombing campaign has dramatically been reduced. In the central part, [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=200.0s)]
*  the Israelis seem to be surrounding the major city there and Hamas' locations. They haven't [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=206.0s)]
*  really begun the clearing. Down in the south, where all the people are focused, and I think [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=213.2s)]
*  the leaders are there, as well as the hostages, I'm not convinced the Israelis have made up their [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=217.52s)]
*  mind whether they're going to go into Rafa or not, given the civilian population there. They [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=223.28s)]
*  have to be reassessing their strategy, Bill, in terms of, is it still realistic to be able to [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=228.4s)]
*  destroy Hamas, given the subterranean challenges they have, given the presence of the hostages [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=234.88s)]
*  that are still likely in the hands of Hamas? And listen, look, they're not going to give these [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=242.72s)]
*  hostages up. They're their ticket for freedom for the leaders themselves, and that's the reality of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=249.68s)]
*  what we're dealing with. This is a much more difficult challenge, I think, than what IDF [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=256.16s)]
*  initially thought it was going to be. General, thank you. Important topics all around. We'll [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=261.68s)]
*  bring you back real soon. Thank you for your time, Jack Keene. I'm Steve Ducey. I'm Brian [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e3uaMWudK_Q&t=267.36s)]
