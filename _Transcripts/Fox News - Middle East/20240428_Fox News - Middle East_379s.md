# 'Inmates are in charge of the asylum' as universities face anti-Israel protests: Rep. Virginia Foxx
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg)
*  I am here today joining my colleagues and calling on President Shafik to resign if she cannot immediately bring order to this chaos. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=0.0s)]
*  That's House Speaker Mike Johnson joining the chorus of Republicans calling for Columbia's president to resign due to the out of control anti-Israel protests on her campus. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=11.0s)]
*  For more on the surge in what looks like campus anti-Semitism in America, let's bring in North Carolina Republican Congresswoman Virginia Foxx who serves as chair of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=23.0s)]
*  Big picture, Congresswoman Foxx. When you look at what's going on in these college campuses across America, what crosses your mind? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=37.0s)]
*  Well, what crosses my mind is what I said at Columbia. The inmates are in charge of the asylum. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=45.0s)]
*  John, this is totally unacceptable what's happening on these campuses. These presidents, these boards of trustees need to get control of the campuses. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=52.0s)]
*  This is ridiculous that Jewish students feel unsafe and I don't blame them. When we were there at Columbia, it was chaos. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=64.0s)]
*  And from everything that we've seen from Fox News, we know that this is the way it is on other campuses. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=73.0s)]
*  So they have to get control of their campuses. You cannot, again, let the inmates run the asylum. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=82.0s)]
*  Having these students threaten the Jewish students, make them feel unsafe, stop them from being able to be in a safe learning environment or even go to class. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=90.0s)]
*  It's unacceptable. Well, you met with your committee, met with President Shafik and the board of trustees at Columbia, right? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=102.0s)]
*  Any any results from that? Not really. Their words, they say words, but they don't back them up with action. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=110.0s)]
*  And what we want to see is action on the part of the board of trustees and the president. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=119.0s)]
*  Talk is cheap. That's what I told her privately. That's what we told her at the meeting. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=125.0s)]
*  We want them to get control of the campus. The Jewish students, all students should feel safe. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=132.0s)]
*  And to say in that email that they sent out, oh, that you're not supposed to say these things, we'll take action about these students. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=138.0s)]
*  We've been told this one student has been barred from campus. What does that mean? Is he taking classes remotely? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=150.0s)]
*  I mean, saying that you want to kill Zionists, that you want to kill Jews, unacceptable. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=158.0s)]
*  The the committee has well, let me put up, first of all, a some of the pictures of your fellow Republican House members who have called on President Shafik to resign. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=168.0s)]
*  There there they are. Ten altogether New York Republicans calling for Columbia to either dismiss her or calling on her to resign. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=183.0s)]
*  Is that possible? Do you get any sense that she would consider resigning over all this? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=196.0s)]
*  Well, whether she resigns or whether the trustees ask her to resign or let her go is up to Columbia. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=201.0s)]
*  What we want is action on the part of the trustees and the president. We want them to stop the threatening behavior toward Jewish students. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=211.0s)]
*  And, you know, John, if the if they replace her with somebody who doesn't do any better than what she's doing, then it doesn't matter. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=221.0s)]
*  It's the actions that the trustees need to be taking and others on that campus. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=230.0s)]
*  They need to make the students feel safe. They need to stop the bad behavior. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=236.0s)]
*  The actions of the students need consequences as long as they just keep talking and they don't do anything to the students. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=242.0s)]
*  They're not going to get anywhere. That's unacceptable. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=251.0s)]
*  I want to show you what's going on right now in Washington, D.C. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=255.0s)]
*  The White House Correspondents Dinner is scheduled for tonight. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=258.0s)]
*  That's a big deal, you know, for newspaper, magazines, TV and radio people. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=260.0s)]
*  The president makes an appearance and there are protesters out there in the street outside the hotel where the dinner is to be held. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=265.0s)]
*  And you can see many of them are lying down in the street blocking traffic, of course, just causing a headache for people who, you know, want to get by and get about their Saturday evening. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=275.0s)]
*  What is it going to take to stop this, Congresswoman? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=287.0s)]
*  You need to have consequences. People need to be put in jail. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=292.0s)]
*  They need to have severe fines, but you cannot continue to block traffic. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=296.0s)]
*  You can't disrupt the campuses without some kinds of consequences. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=303.0s)]
*  That's part of the problem. These people see no consequences. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=309.0s)]
*  We've seen reports that they're being paid to do this. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=313.0s)]
*  I believe that there are paid agitators that go around to different events and all they want to do is disrupt other people's lives. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=317.0s)]
*  They need to get a life of their own. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=327.0s)]
*  They need not to be being paid to do this or being given government subsidies and not having to work a real job. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=329.0s)]
*  It would be good to see your committee follow the money trail and see where some of this money is coming from. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=339.0s)]
*  We will be doing that, John. Our investigation will be wide ranging and deep. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=344.0s)]
*  That is welcome news to a lot of Americans, I think. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=352.0s)]
*  North Carolina Republican Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, Congresswoman. Thank you. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=354.0s)]
*  Thank you, John. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=359.0s)]
*  You can get it all here on YouTube. So subscribe right now. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vxFsMVS-KPg&t=374.0s)]
