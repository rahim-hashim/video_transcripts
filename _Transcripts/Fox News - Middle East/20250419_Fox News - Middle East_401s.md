# Iran must end its enrichment program: Foreign policy expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [April 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I)
*  All right, for more on these key Trump foreign policy developments, let's bring in U.S.-Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=0.0s)]
*  Education Association Director of Policy and Foreign Policy Consultant E.J. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=9.96s)]
*  Kimball and former Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary under President Biden, Sabrina Singh. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=14.4s)]
*  Guys, thank you for joining us this afternoon. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=19.240000000000002s)]
*  E.J., all this discussion, can Iran have any nuclear program as long as they don't build [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=21.72s)]
*  a bomb or does it all have to be ripped out? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=27.44s)]
*  Look, the Iranians need to get rid of this enrichment program completely. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=30.16s)]
*  I was just in Israel a couple weeks ago and everyone that I met with there was very clear [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=36.56s)]
*  that there will be no Iranian nuclear program there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=42.24s)]
*  Finished. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  And the Israelis, even though we've heard the leaks that came out with the New York [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Times article about the president, President Trump, waving off an Israeli strike, the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=51.2s)]
*  Israelis are going to get rid of this threat if they feel that it threatens their existence. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=57.08s)]
*  And we saw that today in Lebanon with a strike on a suspected Hezbollah house. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=63.28s)]
*  The Israelis are not going back to an October 6th mindset. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=68.52s)]
*  And for the U.S. here, it has to be very clear to the Iranians that they will not be allowed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=72.4s)]
*  to continue with this nuclear enrichment program. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=77.6s)]
*  And the only way to actually get that across is to have a credible military threat. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=79.68s)]
*  The moving of a second aircraft carrier into the region, the attacks on their proxies in [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=84.6s)]
*  Yemen have sent a message to the Iranians that something needs to change or you will [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=89.8s)]
*  not be here anymore. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=95.28s)]
*  Sabrina, you guys went through this months, years with the Iranians, trying to restart [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=96.28s)]
*  some type of nuclear agreement. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=102.44s)]
*  Why did that fail and can it succeed now? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=104.44s)]
*  Well, it failed because under the first Trump administration, you know, Donald Trump withdrew [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=106.72s)]
*  the United States from that agreement. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=110.84s)]
*  You're looking at why we are here today. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  It is because of that collapse that the administration originally pulled the sound of that. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=114.88s)]
*  Getting them back in, getting them a new deal, that attempt failed. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=118.16s)]
*  I think right now, you know, Iran is economically, financially and militarily isolated. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=120.72s)]
*  And because of, you know, what the United States did with Israel and some of the responses [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=125.72s)]
*  to Iran's attack on Israel, Iran is severely weakened. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=129.88s)]
*  So it is a good moment for the Trump administration to take advantage and continue these talks. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=133.64s)]
*  And I think it's good to see, I think another third round of talks are going to happen, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=138.2s)]
*  possibly next weekend. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=142.12s)]
*  This is a good thing. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=143.36s)]
*  We never want to see Iran get to the point where they can reach a nuclear weapon. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=144.76000000000002s)]
*  But again, I know we're at this moment and we want to put into context, but context is [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=147.96s)]
*  important that we're basically negotiating the deal that Donald Trump pulled the United [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=151.64000000000001s)]
*  States out of now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=156.12s)]
*  Can Donald Trump, the Trump administration, President Trump, get a better deal than the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=157.4s)]
*  deal that the Obama administration reached in 2015? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=161.84s)]
*  I think it's possible to get a better deal, but it also depends on what the Iranians are [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=165.32000000000002s)]
*  willing to do. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=171.08s)]
*  You know, any negotiation cannot succeed if the sides don't have any overlap in their [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=172.28s)]
*  red lines. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=177.44s)]
*  So right now, the Iranians' red lines are contradicting our red lines. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=178.44s)]
*  And if that's the case, there will be no deal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=184.0s)]
*  There is no way to make a deal there. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=186.04s)]
*  But President Trump looks at dealmaking and foreign policy in general, holistically, he's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=187.76s)]
*  looking at it not just diplomatically, but the military posturing, economics and trade. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=193.68s)]
*  All of that comes together and that's where this maximum pressure campaign on the Iranians, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=199.0s)]
*  it's still ramping up. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=203.68s)]
*  They're still being hit. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=205.04000000000002s)]
*  I mean, he's been in less than 100 days. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  This is still impacting and it is growing and getting more challenging for the Iranian [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=208.24s)]
*  regime to keep control in the country and keep the people satisfied with where things [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=213.72s)]
*  are going. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=218.76000000000002s)]
*  So they can make a better deal. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=219.76000000000002s)]
*  The Iranians want a guarantee that the deal won't be changed in the future. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=221.44s)]
*  The only way to do that is to have it as a treaty in the Senate. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=226.16s)]
*  And there's no way that the United States Senate is going to approve a deal that allows [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=229.2s)]
*  Iran to still be able to enrich uranium. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=234.68s)]
*  It's a high bar. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=236.92s)]
*  And you have Steve Wittkopf, who's negotiating this, also dealing with Russia negotiations. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=237.92s)]
*  So Secretary of State Marco Rubio, here's what he had to say about the patience that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=241.88s)]
*  the United States has in those discussions. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=245.76s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=248.32s)]
*  The president has spent 87 days at the highest level of his government, repeatedly taking [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=250.2s)]
*  efforts to bring this war to an end. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=255.32s)]
*  We need to determine very quickly now, and I'm talking about a matter of days, whether [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=257.24s)]
*  or not this is doable in the over the next few weeks. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=260.92s)]
*  If it is, we're in. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=264.71999999999997s)]
*  If it's not, then we'll have to we have other priorities to focus on as well. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  So if the United States is out, Sabrina, what's the next step? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=271.0s)]
*  Well, I think also important here is that, you know, as president-elect, Donald Trump [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=273.92s)]
*  said he would end this war on day one. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=277.76s)]
*  And what you're seeing is diplomacy is very difficult. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=279.92s)]
*  And you have an actor in Vladimir Putin who's really not serious about these negotiations. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=282.88s)]
*  I mean, you have to also remember that very early on in the administration, Donald Trump, [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=287.28s)]
*  Marco Rubio, others put a clean ceasefire on the table, and Ukraine accepted that. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=292.32s)]
*  And Russia did not. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=297.44s)]
*  So I think the important question here is, if the United States walks away from these, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=298.5s)]
*  you know, talks that they've been overseeing, what does that mean for military support? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  Does Ukraine not get any military support anymore from the United States? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=306.28s)]
*  Is intelligence sharing turned off? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=310.08s)]
*  And then I think broader, what kind of message does that send to our allies and partners? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=312.0s)]
*  Because the message it sends to Russia, to China, to Iran, it's very clear that we're [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=317.3s)]
*  willing to walk away from a partner in Europe. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=322.84s)]
*  And I think that is going to send a huge ripple effect throughout the geopolitical system. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=326.72s)]
*  E.J., does President Trump come back if these negotiations fail and put sanctions on Russia, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=331.0s)]
*  pressure Russia, or, you know, where does the U.S. go from there? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=337.48s)]
*  There's already sanctions on Russia, and Russia's been isolated to a large extent for [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=341.78s)]
*  the past few years. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=346.78s)]
*  I think this is why it is so important and critical to secure a minerals deal with Ukraine, [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=348.26s)]
*  because it invests the United States directly in their future. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=353.7s)]
*  And the discussions are that this will get signed this week, this upcoming week. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=357.34s)]
*  But that is vitally important to put some additional levers against Russia, because [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=363.2s)]
*  right now that is the big challenge. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=369.17999999999995s)]
*  What does the U.S. have outside of a military strike, which the U.S. is not prepared to [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=371.1s)]
*  do or engage? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=376.1s)]
*  What other levers can we use with the Russians to bring them to the table? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=377.44s)]
*  E.J. Kimball, Sabrina Singh, thank you so much for joining us this afternoon. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=381.06s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=383.98s)]
*  Really appreciate it. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tPRUtVO3R6I&t=384.98s)]
