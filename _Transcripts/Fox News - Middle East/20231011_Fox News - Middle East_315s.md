# First shipment of U.S. ammo arrives in Israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA)
*  Let us bring in Virginia congressional candidate and Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=0.0s)]
*  Sir, thanks for being here. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=4.24s)]
*  Walk us through exactly what the IDF is doing right now in training up its soldiers for [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=5.76s)]
*  the conflict that is about to, you know, become a ground invasion. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, good morning. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=14.88s)]
*  Thank you for having me. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=16.580000000000002s)]
*  Right now, we have a couple different scenarios unfolding. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=18.0s)]
*  We've got the recalling of a lot of these troops, these reserve units. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=21.44s)]
*  And likely they'll put them through a condensed training program so as to make sure that they're [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=24.44s)]
*  properly outfitted. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=28.36s)]
*  They can integrate well with existing forces. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=29.88s)]
*  And then you've got the troops that are already in uniform, that are prepared. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=32.68s)]
*  They've gone through war gaming. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=36.36s)]
*  They've gone through various different training mechanisms and programs for scenarios such [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=38.0s)]
*  as this. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=42.66s)]
*  When it becomes more complicated is when we start talking about multi-front warfare. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=44.08s)]
*  This is a very, very specific endeavor that is challenging for any nation to unfold. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=48.92s)]
*  So what we see coming out of Lebanon, what we see coming out of Syria will only add to [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=54.56s)]
*  the confusion and the fog of war with what we see nations that are being attacked. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=59.08s)]
*  So Israel, fortunately, has been in this situation for quite a while and has developed some common [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=63.48s)]
*  techniques and strategies on how to properly mitigate that. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=69.2s)]
*  So essentially train up reserve units and then prepare for what might be a long and [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=72.52s)]
*  grueling haul in Gaza, as well as a multi-front conflict. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=77.72s)]
*  Yeah, and it seems like Israel really has to walk a fine line here because the status [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=80.48s)]
*  quo of Hamas controlling Gaza is no longer acceptable given the terror attack that took [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=84.68s)]
*  place on Saturday. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=90.52000000000001s)]
*  But at the same time, if they go in forcefully, it could aggravate and encourage Syria and [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=91.96000000000001s)]
*  Lebanon, as Trey was just talking about, to engage. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=98.28s)]
*  So how do you, you know, what is the ultimate end goal here? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=101.08000000000001s)]
*  And how do you prevent a multi-front conflict from actually taking place? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=106.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's an impossible scenario that Israel's facing. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=110.24000000000001s)]
*  Again, I have to stress the importance of the fact that it's not a scenario that Israel [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=113.72s)]
*  has chosen. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=117.16s)]
*  Israel has been attacked time and time again in many different characteristics and fashions [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=118.16s)]
*  than they've responded appropriately. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=122.67999999999999s)]
*  I think the best thing that they can do is rely upon some of their training and some [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=124.96s)]
*  of their techniques to minimize and reduce casualties to civilians, which they take great [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=128.95999999999998s)]
*  pains to do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=133.88s)]
*  I was, my time in the military, I got to train with soldiers and sailors of the IDF on multiple [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=135.68s)]
*  different iterations, and I was astonished at both the bravery as well as the great attention [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=141.16s)]
*  and focus on minimizing civilian casualties, even at the expense of the well-being of their [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=146.08s)]
*  own troops. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=151.28s)]
*  So these are techniques that they employ when it comes to areas like Gaza or times where [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=152.48000000000002s)]
*  they put boots on the ground. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=157.08s)]
*  Again, they value human life so highly there that they're willing to put their own service [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=158.64000000000001s)]
*  members in harm's way and then to reduce and to mitigate some of the risk to other [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=163.64000000000001s)]
*  civilian populations. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=168.24s)]
*  But again, we have to make sure to put the blame here for this conflict on Hamas. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=170.0s)]
*  We find that this kind of rhetoric and these actions, which are atrocious, and we're [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=174.16s)]
*  learning more and more by the day, these actions have one intent and purpose, to further embolden [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  this kind of radical behavior against Israel and to ultimately placate towards the sentiments [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=185.88s)]
*  and sympathies of the international community to then perpetuate more actions such as this. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=191.04000000000002s)]
*  So the Palestinians, unfortunately, have an endgame and a strategy in mind that is [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=196.72s)]
*  focused on slowly eroding some of the standing of Israel in the international community's [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=201.16s)]
*  eyes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=206.04000000000002s)]
*  And it's just an impossible scenario that Israel has time and time again had to face [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  where the standards are not always fair. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=211.64000000000001s)]
*  Cameron, let's talk about the realities of the fight, because I spoke with one of our [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=213.64000000000001s)]
*  Fox military colleagues who said, don't fool yourself. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=218.36s)]
*  These soldiers know that based upon the expected urban house-to-house combat that they are [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=221.72s)]
*  about to engage in, that this is somewhat of a suicide mission, and these individuals, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=228.36s)]
*  these brave men and women, know that that is what they are about to undertake. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=235.48s)]
*  Do you share that grim reality? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=239.32s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=241.72s)]
*  Obviously, there's quite a bit of factors that I'm not personally aware of that they're [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=242.72s)]
*  planning for at the present moment. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=247.48s)]
*  Israel has a very robust intelligence network, as well as kind of military operations planning [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=249.68s)]
*  cells. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=254.48s)]
*  So likely they're strategizing down to the granular level about key neighborhoods, key [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=255.48s)]
*  districts, roads, alleyways, key and known points of area where they're staging, where [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=259.92s)]
*  they have munitions, depots and things of that nature. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=265.71999999999997s)]
*  So how they unfold block to block will be something unique that they'll have to use [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=268.12s)]
*  their best kept tools and their infrastructure to provide support with. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=273.68s)]
*  With that being said, the troops that the IDF employs and that sends into those regions, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=278.44s)]
*  they are exactly that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=283.71999999999997s)]
*  They know this is a war of annihilation. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  They understand very well that if they don't put up a fight and that if they're not willing [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=287.56s)]
*  to stand and act as bastions to defend freedom and democracy in Israel, it would mean the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=291.44s)]
*  destruction of that peaceful land. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=296.88s)]
*  So it's one of the, they're some of the bravest and most noble people that I've ever had the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=298.64s)]
*  of serving with because they very much understand the complexities of what happens when they [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=303.56s)]
*  don't fight. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=309.71999999999997s)]
*  Cameron Hamilton, thank you so much for your insight this morning. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=311.68s)]
*  We appreciate it. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8xRFr7cxeA&t=314.5s)]
