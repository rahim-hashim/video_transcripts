# Mark Levin: This is 'full story' on the infiltration of America
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs)
*  You're seeing all these protesters, even in the Capitol building. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=0.0s)]
*  And you know what's interesting? [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=3.44s)]
*  We know who they are. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=4.6000000000000005s)]
*  Our government knows who they are. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=6.44s)]
*  The Biden administration knows who they are. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=8.16s)]
*  I know who they are. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=10.52s)]
*  I provided the information with various media outlets and various reporters, and [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=12.16s)]
*  they have utterly ignored it. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=16.04s)]
*  So I'm going to spend my opening talking about who these people are. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=17.92s)]
*  Are they just happening? [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=21.72s)]
*  Is this just wokeism? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=22.68s)]
*  No. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=24.16s)]
*  It's much worse. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=25.6s)]
*  Believe it or not, we've been infiltrated. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=26.92s)]
*  We've been infiltrated the Hamas Network in America and over at George Washington [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=29.72s)]
*  University, they've written all about it. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=35.0s)]
*  They put a paper out this month, their program on extremism at George Washington [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=36.6s)]
*  University, the Hamas Network in America. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=41.44s)]
*  The media aren't even looking at this. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=45.36s)]
*  It's available to everybody, but I want to tell you about it because that way [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=48.0s)]
*  you'll know about it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=52.76s)]
*  In the months following the 1987 formation of Hamas, Muslim Brotherhood branches and [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=53.68s)]
*  offshoots throughout the world activated themselves to assist the newly formed [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=60.28s)]
*  organization that is Hamas. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=64.28s)]
*  According to international documents released in federal court in 1988, the [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=67.24s)]
*  head of the Palestine section of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Middle East [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=71.08s)]
*  traveled to the United States where he met with fellow Muslim Brothers to seek [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=75.6s)]
*  their support. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=79.92s)]
*  The result of the meeting was the formation of the Palestine Committee of [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=80.64s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood in America, of course. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=84.28s)]
*  In October 1992, internal memorandum of the Palestine Committee clearly explained [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=86.91999999999999s)]
*  the Muslim Brotherhood's vision of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=91.64s)]
*  I quote, [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  Palestine is the one for which Muslim Brotherhood prepared armies made up from [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=96.88s)]
*  the children of Islam and the Arab and Islamic nations to liberate its land from [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=102.28s)]
*  the abomination and the defilement of the children of the Jews. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  And they watered its pure soil with their honorable blood, which sprouted into a [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=113.72s)]
*  jihad that is continuing until the day of resurrection and provided a zeal [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=118.44s)]
*  without relenting, making the slogan of its children, it is a jihad for victory [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=122.84s)]
*  or martyrdom. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=127.2s)]
*  The document also called on the committee to work to, quote, increase the [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=128.88s)]
*  financial and moral support for Hamas to fight surrendering solutions, in other [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=132.12s)]
*  words, no peace, and to publicize and focus on the savagery of the Jews. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=137.76000000000002s)]
*  Reflecting the traditional pyramidal structure of Brotherhood organizations, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=143.12s)]
*  stick with me, they're very important, the committee was composed of the heads of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=148.16000000000003s)]
*  three U.S.-based organizations that had been set up to aid Hamas in Palestine. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=151.96s)]
*  The General Purpose Islamic Association of Palestine, the financial arm [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=158.24s)]
*  represented by the Occupied Land Fund, which later became the Holy Land [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=163.48000000000002s)]
*  Foundation, and the United Association for Studies and Research, a think tank. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=167.84s)]
*  These three organizations, each operating in its field, but all deeply [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=172.76000000000002s)]
*  interconnected, constituted the public face here in the United States of the [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=176.76000000000002s)]
*  secret structure of the Muslim Brotherhood Hamas in America. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  They've infiltrated our country, and this is not being discussed in the media at [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=186.68s)]
*  all, even with people I've shared these documents with, these scholarly [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=190.56s)]
*  documents, this one from George Washington University. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=193.28s)]
*  Now, there was a meeting in Philadelphia. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  The members of this committee decided to convene an extraordinary three-day [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=200.04000000000002s)]
*  meeting in Philadelphia held at the Marriott Hotel near the city's airport. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=203.60000000000002s)]
*  The closed-door meeting was attended by some 20 top leaders of Hamas support [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=208.12s)]
*  network in the United States. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Unbeknownst to the participants, the FBI placed wiretaps into the hotel, taping [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=214.48s)]
*  most of the conversations that took place behind the doors of the hotel's [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=219.44s)]
*  conference room. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=223.07999999999998s)]
*  The transcripts of most conversations were introduced as evidence during [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=224.51999999999998s)]
*  the Holy Land Foundation in 1993. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=228.84s)]
*  Attending the meeting were representatives of the three groups making up the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=232.35999999999999s)]
*  Palestine committee. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Following a common pattern, most of them were united by blood ties and lived in [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=238.0s)]
*  tight-knit communities such as in Washington and Chicago and Dallas. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=242.39999999999998s)]
*  So here is part of what they were discussing. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=247.04s)]
*  Faced with two conflicting needs, the participants opted for a two-pronged [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=249.48s)]
*  approach that differentiated between its internal and external strategy. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=254.12s)]
*  Within the Muslim community agreed the participants the committee should [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=259.03999999999996s)]
*  maintain its support for Hamas undeterred, engaging in various activities [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=262.84s)]
*  to aid the organization. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=267.04s)]
*  In the coming stage, they said, the most important thing we can provide is to [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=269.08000000000004s)]
*  support jihad in Palestine. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=273.32s)]
*  I believe it is the only way if we want to bring the goals of the Oslo Peace [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=275.0s)]
*  Accords, in other words, to destroy them. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=279.68s)]
*  Fundraising among local Muslim communities was immediately identified as [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=282.28000000000003s)]
*  one of the key activities the group should have engaged in. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=286.20000000000005s)]
*  The newly created Holy Land Foundation, in fact, was to collect funds for Hamas [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=289.20000000000005s)]
*  while giving the impression that it was destinating them to orphans and needy [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=294.0s)]
*  children. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=298.04s)]
*  Well, of course. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=298.48s)]
*  At the same time, argued meeting participants, the committee should have [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=300.08000000000004s)]
*  engaged in an extensive effort to educate the American Muslim community, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=303.20000000000005s)]
*  convincing them that the peace accords harmed the Palestinians and that Hamas [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=307.68s)]
*  was the only force worth supporting. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=312.12s)]
*  Several participants argued that the committee should have been particularly [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=314.68s)]
*  active in spreading this message among the youth. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=318.04s)]
*  They said, we don't want the children of the American Muslim community who are [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=321.04s)]
*  raised here in schools and in Islamic schools and non-Islamic schools to grow [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=324.92s)]
*  up surrendering to the issue of peace with the Jews. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=329.08s)]
*  I mean, we don't see in 10 years the growing generation in America surrendering [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=332.48s)]
*  to peace with the Jews. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=336.76s)]
*  Therefore, there must be curricula and teaching materials which spread in [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=337.72s)]
*  Islamic schools and in weekend schools. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=341.16s)]
*  Another speaker argued that the committee should have used the annual [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=343.48s)]
*  conference and the network of Islamic schools run by affiliated organizations [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=346.48s)]
*  to disseminate books and introduce speakers who could raise awareness over [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=350.76s)]
*  the need to support Hamas happening right in our country right now. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=354.48s)]
*  Has been happening for decades. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=358.88s)]
*  If the internal strategy, the committee aimed at mobilizing the American Muslim [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=361.48s)]
*  community to support Hamas, meeting participants understood that they could [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=364.96s)]
*  also play an important role in aiding the group by influencing American public [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=368.88s)]
*  opinion and policymakers, and that would include the press. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=374.04s)]
*  Ahmed, in particular, stressed the need to increase the committee's influence [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=377.12s)]
*  with Congress. This can be achieved by infiltrating the American media outlets, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=381.6s)]
*  universities, research centers, he said. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=386.16s)]
*  It's also achieved by working with Islamic political organizations and the [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=388.68s)]
*  sympathetic ones such as the American Muslim Alliance, such as the United [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=392.24s)]
*  Muslims of America, such as Muslim Public Affairs Council. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=397.16s)]
*  If Muslims engage in political activism in America and started to be concerned [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=401.04s)]
*  with Congress and public relations, we will have an entry point to use them to [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=405.56s)]
*  pressure Congress and the decision makers in America. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=409.44s)]
*  You see that happening all over. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=412.16s)]
*  You see what Tlaib and the squad, you see it with soft support for American [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=413.48s)]
*  policy. And by the way, all these groups hate America, want to take America down. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=417.64s)]
*  And I have no doubt we're involved in the 2020 riots. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=422.12s)]
*  The development of a carefully crafted media strategy defending Hamas without [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=424.84s)]
*  giving the impression of supporting violence was deemed to be one of the most [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=428.6s)]
*  important aspects of the committee's public relations campaign. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=432.2s)]
*  Ahmed spoke of the need of broadcasting the Islamic point of view in U.S. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=435.68s)]
*  media, adding that when Nihad appeared on CNN and talked in the way that he [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWtf33czGUs&t=439.36s)]
