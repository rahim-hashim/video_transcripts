# IDF spokesperson: Hamas preventing release of American hostages 'not known to us'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 25, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU)
*  Let's bring in the Israel Defense Forces spokesperson, Major Doron Spielman, who also [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=0.0s)]
*  serves in the IDF Reserves. Tell us about this prisoner release, 17 released, we understand. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=5.68s)]
*  Is that the extent of it for today? Thank you for having me, John. We are certainly on the [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=14.72s)]
*  verge of celebration as those tasajis, the 17, you are correct, 13 Israelis, many of them, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=22.56s)]
*  young, young children who were snatched for their bed, and four Thailandese civilians are [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=30.479999999999997s)]
*  being returned into Israel as we speak. They're crossing over the border. They're going to be [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=36.48s)]
*  heading into having medical checks and then brought to hospitals where they are going to [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=40.480000000000004s)]
*  be reunited with their families. And this is really a mixed emotion because on one hand, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=46.959999999999994s)]
*  they're going to be embraced by their families, by the state of Israel. And on the other hand, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  a number of these children, their family members have been killed and they actually don't have [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  that information. So there is a tragedy that is really locked in with this joy. And it's just [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=65.03999999999999s)]
*  the symbol of the tragedy that Hamas inflicted upon Israel, but we're happy to begin getting [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=70.8s)]
*  our people home. It is my understanding that the convoy of the former hostages is now on Israeli [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=76.32s)]
*  territory. So that is very, very good news. But we are still talking about relatively small numbers [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=84.47999999999999s)]
*  compared to the roughly 230 hostages that were originally taken. Only about a little over 10% [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=91.11999999999999s)]
*  have been released now. Absolutely. The vast majority of our people are still inside those [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=98.24s)]
*  tunnels, deep inside the belly of the earth. We don't know if they are alive. We don't know [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=104.72s)]
*  if they're dead. Hamas has refused to allow the Red Cross to check them. Again, this is a heinous. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=110.16s)]
*  Imagine what these people are going through. They haven't seen the light of day. We don't know their [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=116.64s)]
*  health. And just being kept there is inhumane. It's a violation of human rights. It's a war crime. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=121.2s)]
*  And we have said, and we're very, very clear, we're committed to this framework to bring home [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=128.48s)]
*  as many hostages as we can. As it allows, we will do whatever we need to do to bring home [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=133.28s)]
*  all of our hostages. For us, this is a pause. Our military objectives to destroy Hamas are not only [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=138.8s)]
*  on the table. We're committed to this because all of our people have to come home. And we have to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=145.36s)]
*  make sure, John, that this can never, ever happen again, not to us and not to anyone else. We haven't [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=149.44s)]
*  really spoken about this, but Palestinian prisoners were released from Israeli custody [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=155.44s)]
*  as part of this deal, correct? Can you tell us about who they are? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  Absolutely. There's a vast difference here. We are talking about Israeli hostages [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=166.96s)]
*  that were snatched from their beds in the middle of the night. The prisoners that we are releasing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=171.68s)]
*  are all, have associations with either terrorism or very security-based criminal activity. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=176.96s)]
*  We are releasing people who you wouldn't want your children playing with. These are [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=185.36s)]
*  people who have thrown Molotov cocktails, have stabbed people, have attempted murder, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=189.36s)]
*  and have associations with Hamas and other terror-related groups. It's a painful [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=195.60000000000002s)]
*  thing for us to be able to allow them to go back into society because we're afraid that they'll [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  carry this out again. But it's a price that we're willing to pay. We hope that they are going to [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=206.8s)]
*  try to live a life of hope, but it's what we're willing to pay in order to bring our people home. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=210.88000000000002s)]
*  Do you know anything about the status of future hostage negotiations, future releases? [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=215.2s)]
*  We do. We are committed to the agreement, the framework that is being ushered by Egypt, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=222.16s)]
*  by Qatar, of course, with the involvement of the United States, says that over the next two days, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=227.76s)]
*  there's going to be a continual round of the release of Israelis, of Israeli hostages that [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=232.64s)]
*  are being held. We're expecting 13 more tomorrow, hopefully 13 more the following day, and we're [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=237.51999999999998s)]
*  just waiting for our people to come home. And each of these waves, John, is a journey unto itself. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=244.08s)]
*  These people, their journey has just begun. Just the mental, the therapy, the psychological process [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=249.84s)]
*  that they're going to need to go through, not only dealing with family members who've been killed, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=256.64s)]
*  they actually don't know about October 7th. They don't understand what has happened. They don't [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=260.8s)]
*  understand the gravity and the scale of this attack. This is going to take months, if not years, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=265.2s)]
*  for these people to reintegrate into society and hopefully live positive lives. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=271.04s)]
*  Obviously, the Israeli, the number of Israeli hostages is huge in far out ways, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=275.44s)]
*  those of any other country. But obviously, I'm reporting for an American-based news channel. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  So far, American hostages continue to be held, no releases yet. Do you have any idea why that is? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=290.0s)]
*  You know, we have, of course, wondered the same thing on the Israeli side. We want the release of [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=298.96000000000004s)]
*  all of these hostages completely. Why we have not seen these American hostages come home [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=303.92s)]
*  is not known to us. What we do know is everything Hamas does. We have to understand, if there is a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=309.76000000000005s)]
*  opportunity for Hamas to inflict emotional pain, they will do so. One example is, we're eight hours [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=316.08000000000004s)]
*  behind schedule right now, John. The families that were notified that their family, their loved ones [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=324.71999999999997s)]
*  are coming home, have been waiting for eight hours. All of a sudden, we heard the agreement was off, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=329.92s)]
*  and then it's back on. These delaying tactics are part of the psychological warfare Hamas is waging. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=334.88s)]
*  They are exploiting us. They're exploiting you and the Americans. The taking of these hostages [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=340.64s)]
*  is just part of what they do. And therefore, we can assume that whatever is going on here is in [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=346.15999999999997s)]
*  order to inflict emotional pain. We are going to do everything. We're committed to bring all [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=352.08s)]
*  those hostages home, Israeli, American, and all those foreign nationals. Hamas also blamed [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=356.4s)]
*  your side, the Israeli side, for some kind of a holdup in the release earlier today. They said [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=361.76s)]
*  they were putting it on pause because the Israelis were not living up to their agreements. Can you [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=367.84s)]
*  explain? That is simply not true. We have committed to this agreement. It's being moderated by Egypt [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=374.24s)]
*  and Qatar. We have adhered to it. We have kept our word. We've honored all elements of that [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=382.48s)]
*  agreement. In fact, we have stopped firing on Hamas, meaning we have the noose around Hamas' neck, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=386.72s)]
*  and we're closing in on them. And they were feeling that, and in order to allow our hostages [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=396.16s)]
*  to come, we've held back our fire. We've adhered to it. Qatar and Egypt are working tirelessly [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=402.08s)]
*  to try to ensure that Hamas will adhere to this as well. They've broken many agreements in the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=407.68s)]
*  past. We're hoping this one time they will be able to keep to their word so we can see these innocent [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=412.88s)]
*  people who have been living this life of terror come home. We as a nation, their families and the [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=418.08s)]
*  Israeli people, and I know people around the world, are all waiting for them just to come back to [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=423.68s)]
*  safety. And it's in Hamas' hands to keep their word. Now, speaking of people around the world, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=428.4s)]
*  there have been huge pro-Palestinian and even pro-Hamas demonstrations in places like New York [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=432.96s)]
*  and London and Germany. What do you say to the people who are out there protesting on [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=440.32s)]
*  behalf of the Palestinians and, frankly, against Israel? What we've seen is really just, I think, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=446.96s)]
*  something that is almost grotesque in how either misinformed or misdirected they are. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=456.4s)]
*  We're talking about people who some understand but some may not. They are supporting an organization [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=463.91999999999996s)]
*  that if those people had been on the Israeli border cities inside Israel at that time, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=469.67999999999995s)]
*  they would have been killed, cut down, massacred, and taken hostage. It's just simply naiveté to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=475.28s)]
*  support an organization that is, their main objective calls for the destruction of Israel [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=482.32s)]
*  and the death of a Jewish person anywhere around the world. They need to be ashamed. They need to [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=487.84s)]
*  mend their ways, and they need to come and apologize because it's like standing with Hitler [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=492.56s)]
*  as he walks into Berlin. They may not understand what they're doing, but this is what we're talking [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=498.0s)]
*  about. True evil. True evil. How much of those protests do you think are being fomented by the [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=502.8s)]
*  Iranians? I'm sure that they are behind a lot of what's going on. John, the Iranian access is [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=508.0s)]
*  everywhere around the world. The largest sponsor of state terrorism. I wouldn't be surprised if we [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=515.04s)]
*  didn't find direct links to this in the future. And I think this is really a question. I say that [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=521.52s)]
*  as an American as well as an Israeli. When I see this in my own family lives in America, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=526.32s)]
*  in various places, I'm worried for their safety because Iran, their terror doesn't stop at Israel's [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=531.6s)]
*  doorstep. We just happen to be first. Their goals are world terrorism. Just the same reason why [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=537.12s)]
*  our war with Hamas is not just a war with Israel. Hamas has its sights around the world. And I think [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=543.68s)]
*  many people in the world understand this. We have to be dedicated to wiping out this evil because [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=549.84s)]
*  it's against freedom. It's against good. It is evil against good. And that's what we're facing. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=554.4s)]
*  We just happen to be on the front line. Well, again, there is a bit of good news this evening. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=559.92s)]
*  The banner is on our screen right now. Seven children and six women released from Hamas [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=565.92s)]
*  captivity in Gaza. Four of those we believe to be Thai nationals. The others are Israelis, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=572.8s)]
*  and they are all now, we understand, on Israeli soil. Your final thoughts as we wrap this up, Major. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=580.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, it's a ray of light in a very dark period, John. It's prayers that have been answered, [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=588.9599999999999s)]
*  and it gives all of us hope to keep praying, to keep working hard, to keep up with our military [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=594.96s)]
*  activity. And we are thankful for the American people for standing behind us. Ultimately speaking, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=599.52s)]
*  good will defend, will defeat evil. And we're going to see that play out in Israel and getting [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=605.2800000000001s)]
*  home the rest of our people. All right. Major Doron Spielman of the Israeli Defense Forces. Again, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=609.84s)]
*  it's good news tonight, and that's been in very short supply in your corner of the world. Thanks [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=617.52s)]
*  very much for coming on with us tonight. Thank you, sir. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWBCZvQPtvU&t=623.6s)]
