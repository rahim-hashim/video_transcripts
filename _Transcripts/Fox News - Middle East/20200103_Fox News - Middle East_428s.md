# Rand Paul makes dire prediction on Baghdad airstrike fallout
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM)
*  to bernie sanders a big critic of the the move on the part of the president [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=0.0s)]
*  today but so was republican kentucky senator ran paul saying he's concerned [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=2.96s)]
*  that this will lead to an escalation in this conflict he joins us now by phone [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=8.02s)]
*  senator you are saying that u.s. soldiers deserve better than an [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=12.38s)]
*  undeclared war with a ran do you think that's what we're looking at here [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=15.84s)]
*  i think the problem is is that there is an open question whether or not attacks [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=20.52s)]
*  from a ran or more or less likely [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=24.92s)]
*  you can say that solamani was plotting to attack the u.s. they will be true [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=27.12s)]
*  with his death you think it's more or less likely that a ran and their [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=32.4s)]
*  malicious and their proxies will attack the u.s. i would argue that it's much [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=35.68s)]
*  more likely [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=39.120000000000005s)]
*  and i think as you have an escalation that they were to kill u.s. soldiers [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=40.44s)]
*  there will be another response from us which will be a further escalation [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=44.28s)]
*  i think without a declaration of war without congress and the american people [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=48.56s)]
*  behind it [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=52.2s)]
*  what you get is a messy mission you get a mission of escalating [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=53.18000000000001s)]
*  intermittent violence [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=56.74s)]
*  but it really has no purpose or plan [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=58.400000000000006s)]
*  and the country doesn't hasn't been told to be united [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=60.86s)]
*  the president said he didn't want perpetual war in the middle east but he's [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=64.4s)]
*  adding more and more troops if you don't want perpetual war you don't keep [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=67.38s)]
*  sending more targets over there [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=70.82000000000001s)]
*  that does sound a lot like senator bernie sanders also presidential candidate [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=72.98s)]
*  tulsi gabbard senators said [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=77.26s)]
*  that the president violated the constitution by declaring an act of war [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=79.18s)]
*  against a ran do you agree with that [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=83.36s)]
*  here's the question if you can say that assassination which is an act of violence [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=86.72000000000001s)]
*  is not an act of war [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=90.88000000000001s)]
*  what happens when uh... ran [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  unfortunately [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=95.12s)]
*  respond and kill some of our soldiers [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=96.26s)]
*  will that be an act of war and will a state of war exist [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=98.52000000000001s)]
*  you know in the past when president sent uh... misses to the congress saying that [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=101.76s)]
*  war exists [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=106.02000000000001s)]
*  they don't have to declare war that they usually typically write a letter to [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=107.14000000000001s)]
*  congress saying a state of war exists [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=110.30000000000001s)]
*  so i think that that may be what happened you know if there is a response [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  to this is that it is an excessive [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=115.96000000000001s)]
*  an unfortunate attack on u.s. soldiers [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=118.18s)]
*  i think a state of war will exist and so i don't think you can do an [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  assassination with it like this [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=124.34s)]
*  think or at least believe that one of the unintended consequences will be war [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=127.4s)]
*  with the ran [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=131.12s)]
*  so that's why we we in the constitution didn't allow one person to make these [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=132.2s)]
*  decisions [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=136.32s)]
*  uh... assassination or however you get involved in war [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=137.3s)]
*  uh... any of these things were to be done only with the will of congress as [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=140.56s)]
*  the will of people [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=143.76s)]
*  and so this was something we adhere to [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=145.0s)]
*  fairly strictly for a hundred fifty or more years and then the last fifty to [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=147.58s)]
*  a hundred years we haven't done so well [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=151.08s)]
*  you know your colleague senator marco rubio of florida's serbs said that [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=153.44s)]
*  some of any was [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=156.86s)]
*  indeed plotting a coup in iraq but this is not an assassination [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=157.96s)]
*  that he was in iraq in violation of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=161.76s)]
*  u.n. security council travel ban [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=164.18s)]
*  uh... and that his plot was to kill american soldiers [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=166.64s)]
*  so we had to take about [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=170.26s)]
*  what do you think [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=171.48s)]
*  you know i think that uh... [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=173.46s)]
*  there is evidence that uh... i'd these were planted during the iraq war that [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=175.66s)]
*  did kill americans that they came from iran [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=179.8s)]
*  uh... the sole money bear responsibility for that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=182.44s)]
*  i'd i would say that there is evidence of that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=185.12s)]
*  his planning of attacks now they've been talking about this for years he's [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=187.78s)]
*  he's the one that orchestrates [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=191.46s)]
*  and does direct the different militias and all the different proxy works out [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=193.04000000000002s)]
*  the middle east but i don't doubt that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=196.10000000000002s)]
*  but the question is will there be more or less of these attacks [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=198.18s)]
*  to what happens with his death is worth ending thousands of more troops which [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=201.7s)]
*  are thousands of more targets for them to shoot at [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=205.06s)]
*  and i think that [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=208.01999999999998s)]
*  it's hard to imagine that the iranians are going to shrink now and say [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=209.17999999999998s)]
*  all you killed on are beating general who's been a leader in our country for [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=212.88s)]
*  twenty years [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=216.29999999999998s)]
*  we're going to do nothing [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=217.14s)]
*  i also think with the death of solamani you have the death of diplomacy i don't [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=219.22s)]
*  think there's any chance that or and will speak to us again on diplomacy [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=222.78s)]
*  this is a long way away from where we were at the iraq the nuclear deal [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=226.51999999999998s)]
*  signed under president obama [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=230.06s)]
*  i wasn't a fan of uh... details of the deal [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=231.9s)]
*  but i was a fan of diplomacy the same way i've been a fan of the president [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=234.42s)]
*  talking [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=238.22s)]
*  uh... to the government of north korea even though we have been successful yet [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=239.24s)]
*  i do think that [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=243.14s)]
*  all talk is gone now you can't kill a general of a major uh... [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=244.26s)]
*  a major general of another country and expect that they're going to sit down at [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=248.14s)]
*  the table and discuss with you [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=251.94s)]
*  uh... there's just no scenario that i see that happening now and so that even [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=253.62s)]
*  since the signing of that deal senator i mean the solamani was uh... [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=256.82s)]
*  instrumental in in attacks on american soldiers post even the signing [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=261.65999999999997s)]
*  so it what what would we have saved it if we didn't take him out what is really [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=266.18s)]
*  changed is that your view that this just heightens the possibility of another [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=272.64s)]
*  attack and escalation of soldiers in the region what what's your biggest fear now [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=277.64s)]
*  i think that uh... there will be an escalation that there will be a war [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=283.26s)]
*  with iran i think that as we look at this very hard to see diplomacy going [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=286.53999999999996s)]
*  forward in anything [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=290.38s)]
*  any form of action [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=291.5s)]
*  and uh... really there had been correct fighting between the uh... [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=293.14s)]
*  arraignian militias and uh... for the most part it's a very messy situation [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=297.21999999999997s)]
*  over there but [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=301.14s)]
*  people tend to want to ignore that actually the arraignian militias [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=301.98s)]
*  for all their harm and they have attacked americans during the iraq war [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=305.44s)]
*  in the recent year so they've actually been concerned with the same concern we [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=309.3s)]
*  have and that's been ice is soon the extreme and you talk to the president [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=312.92s)]
*  about this senator uh... any conversations post this attack [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=316.44s)]
*  i have a i haven't talked to the president recently about it but i think [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  he's getting unfortunate counsel from people who've been advocating for [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=323.8s)]
*  regime change in iraq for years i mean [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=327.64000000000004s)]
*  uh... lindsey graham said wanting to topple the government in iran for a year [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=330.88s)]
*  they toppled the government iraq and i think the president realizes that [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=335.24s)]
*  toppling the government iraq [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=338.44s)]
*  actually made iran stronger [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=340.24s)]
*  in fact i think one of the [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=341.8s)]
*  ironic things here is that i think the iraqi parliament will probably now vote [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=343.24s)]
*  for our forces to leave [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=347.04s)]
*  and so there is some irony to the fact that the hawkish passion that wanted [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=348.76000000000005s)]
*  this to happen [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=352.88000000000005s)]
*  they're the ones who want truth to stay forever in iraq [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=354.04s)]
*  uh... they actually may be asked to leave because i think anti-american [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  sentiment among the shia population [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=360.16s)]
*  is on the rise now [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=362.92s)]
*  and look there's no point in the morning [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=364.68s)]
*  do you think we should abandon them as a altogether that sounds like you are [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=367.24s)]
*  walking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=370.6s)]
*  away [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=371.72s)]
*  no i think that uh... there's no one here mourning for the death of solomani [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=373.5s)]
*  including myself i think that he is a person who has been involved in the [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=377.44s)]
*  death of america [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=381.0s)]
*  i'm also not advocating that we'd leave the embassy [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=382.58s)]
*  but i would say that having five thousand troops over there is not having an [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=385.8s)]
*  embassy that's having a significant military force that is a significant [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=389.12s)]

*  iranians are going to escalate this [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=397.2s)]
*  and uh... the president has shown prudence in the past and i think [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=400.12s)]
*  uh... really will keep in the option of diplomacy open [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=404.44s)]
*  but i think that the door has completely shut down diplomacy because i do not see [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fGQio71NtcM&t=408.12s)]
