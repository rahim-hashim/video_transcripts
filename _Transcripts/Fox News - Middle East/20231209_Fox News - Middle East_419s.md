# Mark Levin: Biden and Blinken are 'drenched in blood'
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw)
*  I want to make the point, as clearly as I can, that Joe Biden and Anthony Blinken have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=0.0s)]
*  blood on their hands. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=6.96s)]
*  I mean, they are drenched in blood. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=9.24s)]
*  Now, what am I talking about? [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=11.8s)]
*  Can anybody tell me of any other president in American history who gives aid and support, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=14.56s)]
*  billions of dollars, to our enemy, to our enemy who has killed American soldiers in [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Iraq, to our enemy that has created all kinds of mayhem in the Middle East, to our enemy [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=28.0s)]
*  who is now attacking our armed forces in the Middle East and attacking our allies, that's [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=36.68s)]
*  trying to build an Islamic caliphate throughout the Middle East? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=41.28s)]
*  What kind of a commander-in-chief of the United States of America waves economic sanctions, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=45.72s)]
*  whether it's oil, commerce, finance, banking, you name it, against a regime that sought [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=53.16s)]
*  to assassinate our former secretary of state and our former national security adviser? [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=59.879999999999995s)]
*  Who the hell does that? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=64.84s)]
*  Can you name a single president in American history, a single secretary of state, since [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=66.28s)]
*  we've had secretary of states? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=71.67999999999999s)]
*  Go back to Jefferson. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=74.19999999999999s)]
*  Can you name one who would ever arm our enemy? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=75.19999999999999s)]
*  I have another question. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=79.52s)]
*  What kind of president, what kind of a secretary of state would appoint an individual who is [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=81.84s)]
*  pro-Iran, who is a Marxist, who is a special pleader for Iran, to negotiate a nuclear deal [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=86.76s)]
*  on our behalf against that regime, and then in turn would hire three staffers, one of [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=94.88000000000001s)]
*  whom is a potential spy for that regime, and that envoy had his classification yanked and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=101.84s)]
*  is under investigation and the information is being kept from the United States Congress? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=108.92s)]
*  What kind of a president of the United States and secretary of state appoints such a reprobate [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=114.08s)]
*  to represent the United States? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=120.64s)]
*  What kind of a president of the United States and secretary of state refuses to trigger [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=123.39999999999999s)]
*  what's called snapback a few weeks ago to prevent Iran from being able to make, buy, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=130.48s)]
*  and sell missiles? [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=139.39999999999998s)]
*  That's happened too. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=143.44s)]
*  What kind of a president of the United States and secretary of state arm our terrorist enemies? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=145.79999999999998s)]
*  Arm Hamas. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=150.2s)]
*  Donald Trump said no more money through the UN, UNRWA, to Hamas, which the UN won't even [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=151.35999999999999s)]
*  call a terrorist state, won't even call a terrorist group, so they continue to get money. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=156.68s)]
*  Trump cut it off, Biden in blinking, the money's pouring in again. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=163.56s)]
*  What kind of a president of the United States and secretary of state fund Arafat's PLO [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=167.52s)]
*  with hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars with no conditions whatsoever and [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=173.0s)]
*  refuse to enforce the Taylor Force Act, which tells the Palestinians you don't get any [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=177.5s)]
*  money from the United States unless you stop killing Israelis, killing Americans for which [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=183.12s)]
*  you give pensions, it's called slay for pay, to the terrorist families. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=188.68s)]
*  So what do we have here in Biden and Blinken? [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=195.1s)]
*  Then what do they do in turn? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=199.08s)]
*  They tell the Israelis, look, we want the hostages out. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=201.32s)]
*  They take no responsibility for the hostages. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=206.56s)]
*  They just paid that regime, the Iranian regime, $6 billion for hostages. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=208.76s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, we don't really want you to win the war. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=214.07999999999998s)]
*  We prefer a stalemate, maybe a ceasefire here and there, maybe a permanent ceasefire. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=219.0s)]
*  Hamas isn't going to honor a ceasefire. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=223.12s)]
*  They're a terrorist organization. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=225.79999999999998s)]
*  They don't honor anything. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=226.79999999999998s)]
*  And they even said, this is a dry run, October 7th. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=229.2s)]
*  We're going to keep at this until we get what we want, the obliteration of the Jews in the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  Jewish state. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=236.16s)]
*  So a ceasefire is a surrender. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=237.24s)]
*  Oh, and what else? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=239.68s)]
*  Keep sending fuel and medicine and food in there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=241.96s)]
*  We now actually have Palestinian citizens telling Al Jazeera, Hamas is stealing everything. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=244.8s)]
*  They're taking everything. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=250.92000000000002s)]
*  Well, who's the referee in Gaza to make sure they don't? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=251.92000000000002s)]
*  There aren't any. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=255.16000000000003s)]
*  And this administration keeps putting the pressure on Israel to capitulate, to be nice [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=257.8s)]
*  about the war, to make sure you don't really defeat the enemy, just kind of box them in. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=264.44s)]
*  In other words, Blinken and Biden take no responsibility for what they unleashed in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=270.64s)]
*  the Middle East, where we had the Abraham Accords, where we had peace breaking out between [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  Arab and Muslim countries and the Israelis, where the Iranians were in a box. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=282.03999999999996s)]
*  In fact, they were collapsing. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=286.23999999999995s)]
*  The people were rising up. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=287.91999999999996s)]
*  Where Hamas was in a box, where Hezbollah was in a box. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=289.15999999999997s)]
*  They were on a box. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=291.84s)]
*  Until Biden and Blinken come in and unleash the whole damn thing. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  And now it's Israel's fault. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=299.64s)]
*  Israel's attacked on October 7 in horrendous ways that we don't need to keep describing. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=302.23999999999995s)]
*  And now Israel's considered the aggressor. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=307.03999999999996s)]
*  You have this Marxist fraud, Bernie Sanders in the Senate saying, well, they should not [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=310.64s)]
*  get any funds or we need the condition of funds. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=314.64s)]
*  Israel must do that. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=317.2s)]
*  And then finally, a two-state solution. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=318.36s)]
*  While this war is going on, this two-state solution that's pushed by Thomas Friedman [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=322.44s)]
*  at the New York Times, another Israel hater, that's pushed by the Democrat Party, that [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=329.6s)]
*  was pushed by Obama, is pushed by everybody. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=334.56s)]
*  There was a two-state solution. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=338.12s)]
*  It was called Gaza. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=339.2s)]
*  Look what happened. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=340.32s)]
*  But as I've said here before, the two-state solution for Israel is the final solution. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=342.32s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=346.84000000000003s)]
*  Because you need to understand what the Islamists want. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=347.92s)]
*  It's a caliphate. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=351.6s)]
*  It's not a two-state solution. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=353.68s)]
*  Iran has a state. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=356.04s)]
*  Are they satisfied with their state? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  They've all but taken over Lebanon. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=360.92s)]
*  They've all but taken over Yemen. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  They're in the middle of taking over Iraq. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=363.8s)]
*  They've all but taken over the Gaza Strip. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=365.48s)]
*  They want a caliphate. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=368.40000000000003s)]
*  And not just in the Middle East. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  They're building nuclear weapons. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=372.20000000000005s)]
*  Are they the effort to build nuclear weapons? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=373.44s)]
*  That's not for their neighborhood. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=376.12s)]
*  That's for our neighborhood. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=377.97999999999996s)]
*  And what are we doing to stop them right now? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=380.53999999999996s)]
*  What is the plan? [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=382.78s)]
*  What is the strategy to stop Iran from getting a nuclear weapon right now? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=384.06s)]
*  On Biden and Blinken's watch, there's nothing to stop them, which is why they're racing [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=388.29999999999995s)]
*  to the finish line, because they know they have friends in the United States State Department. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=393.02s)]
*  And they know that it is in the 1930s and 40s, the Israelis have many anti-Semites in [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=398.71999999999997s)]
*  the State Department, and many of them are still there. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9f3o8uS_xFw&t=404.38s)]
