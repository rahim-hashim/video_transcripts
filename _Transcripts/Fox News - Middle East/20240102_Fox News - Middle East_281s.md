# Iranian warship reportedly enters Red Sea, putting global trade at risk
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 02, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns)
*  And an Iranian warship has reportedly entered the Red Sea, putting global trade in that [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=0.0s)]
*  region at risk. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=5.08s)]
*  The move comes just after the U.S. sank three Houthi boats that were attacking merchant [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=6.44s)]
*  ships over the weekend. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  We've got significant national security interest in the region just on our own, the United [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=13.36s)]
*  States. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=17.6s)]
*  And we're going to put the kind of forces we need in the region to protect those interests, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=18.6s)]
*  and we're going to act in self-defense going forward. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=22.28s)]
*  Again, I'm not ruling anything in or out, but we have made it clear publicly to the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=24.28s)]
*  Houthis. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=28.560000000000002s)]
*  We've made it clear privately to our allies and partners in the region that we take these [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=29.919999999999998s)]
*  threats seriously, and we're going to make the right decisions going forward. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=32.36s)]
*  A former Assistant Secretary of State for George W. Bush and former Naval Intel officer [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=35.92s)]
*  Robert Charles joins me now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=40.6s)]
*  Bobby, the Iranians say, oh, we're there to protect trade as well. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=42.68s)]
*  If you believe that, I have a bridge to sell you. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=46.76s)]
*  What do you make of this latest provocation by the Iranians? [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=49.28s)]
*  Look, I think this is not unexpected. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=52.36s)]
*  Iran has been escalating things in this region for a matter of weeks, actually a couple of [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=56.16s)]
*  months. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=60.32s)]
*  And I think we just have to be, as your spokesman or as the Biden spokesman just said, you have [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=61.32s)]
*  to be on really alert. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=66.32s)]
*  I think what Iran is doing is they're very opportunistic. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=67.96s)]
*  I mean, they support all the terrorist groups in the region. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=71.72s)]
*  They historically in the 80s were a force for no good in the Persian Gulf. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=74.6s)]
*  They mined the Persian Gulf and they created a havoc where Reagan ended up having to take [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=80.4s)]
*  out half their Navy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  But right now in the Red Sea, you've got a lot of a lot of terror. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  I mean, you've got you've got basically the Houthi rebels that are entirely supported by [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=90.96s)]
*  Iran having launched 15 attacks on commercial vessels there. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=95.28s)]
*  So this doesn't help. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=99.6s)]
*  Having said that, the real reason I think they did it is that the Gerald Ford carrier [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=100.84s)]
*  strike group is headed back for Norfolk right now. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=104.72s)]
*  Having said that, the Eisenhower carrier strike group is right there in the Med and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=107.91999999999999s)]
*  they have nine fighter squadrons. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=112.96s)]
*  And I think Iran would be foolhardy to do anything right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=115.27999999999999s)]
*  I mean, honestly, they may think I mean, they're playing right up to the line, but they may [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=118.91999999999999s)]
*  think they could do something and get away with it. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=123.28s)]
*  I think they would lose half their Navy again. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=125.0s)]
*  And it could be worse than that. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=126.75999999999999s)]
*  United Kingdom defense secretary also considering strikes against Houthi groups saying we are [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  willing to take direct action and we won't hesitate to take further action to deter threats [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=132.79999999999998s)]
*  to freedom of navigation in the Red Sea. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=138.0s)]
*  Robert, where is a statement like that from our leaders? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=141.20000000000002s)]
*  You have very, very good question, Todd. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=145.76000000000002s)]
*  Look, we should be deterring, deterring, deterring. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  And what that means is you get as specific as you can without giving away the store. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=152.52s)]
*  So you don't tell them exactly what you're going to do, but you make it crystal clear [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=157.48000000000002s)]
*  that if there is any aggressive act taken by Iran in the Red Sea, not only the United [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=161.28s)]
*  States, but all of our allies will come down like a ton of bricks on whoever the provocateur [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=166.0s)]
*  is. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=171.2s)]
*  And that means potentially taking out the Houthi rebels completely. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=172.2s)]
*  It also means taking out any Iranian warship that acts in an aggressive manner against [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=175.55999999999997s)]
*  international trade or commercial shipping, never mind against one of our ships or allies [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=180.16s)]
*  ships in the region, period. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=184.32s)]
*  Meantime, North Korea's Kim Jong-un and China's president Xi Jinping declare 2024 the year [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=186.2s)]
*  of friendship, presumably referring to their own friendship, not ours, Bobby. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=191.83999999999997s)]
*  North Korea's news agency reporting the two parties in two countries will further exchange [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=196.11999999999998s)]
*  and promote visits in all fields, including politics, economy and culture. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  Further deepen the ties of friendship and unity, intensify the cooperation in the joint [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=204.39999999999998s)]
*  struggle to safeguard regional and global peace and stability. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=209.39999999999998s)]
*  That is code word for we're testing you West, specifically the United States. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=213.72s)]
*  What do you make of that? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=218.67999999999998s)]
*  Well, I would say there's both news and non-news here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=221.12s)]
*  I mean, at the end of the day, these two countries have been locked up in their alliance for [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=224.32s)]
*  decades. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=228.28s)]
*  They're communist dictatorships and they see the world the same way, which is essentially [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=228.92000000000002s)]
*  against the interests of the average individual. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=234.20000000000002s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think people have to be aware that North Korea feels isolated [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=236.52s)]
*  right now. They look isolated. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=240.08s)]
*  China is has an economic kind of a problem on their doorstep. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=242.52s)]
*  It's beginning to mushroom. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=246.52s)]
*  And of course, China has aspirations for Taiwan. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=247.96s)]
*  So anytime you see a statement like that, you need to be at least aware that they are [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=250.60000000000002s)]
*  trying to make a statement, even if, in fact, it doesn't telegraph anything specific. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=255.16s)]
*  And just because the ball just because the ball drop doesn't mean the problems of 2023 [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=259.04s)]
*  went away anytime soon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=263.72s)]
*  In fact, they are only magnified. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=265.08s)]
*  Bobby, thanks so much. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=266.72s)]
*  Now, you're right. You're right. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=267.92s)]
*  Happy New Year to you, sir. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BPcU6L58ns&t=269.84000000000003s)]
