# ‘JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL’: IDF vows to keep pressure on Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho)
*  Right now, America's greatest ally in the Middle East, Israel, making the world a safer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=0.0s)]
*  place as brand new video shows Israeli forces striking more than 150 targets. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=5.24s)]
*  And this morning we've got new details about how Israel took down Iran with killing 30 [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=11.72s)]
*  commanders by essentially tricking them into meeting and keeping them there, into a meeting [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=18.92s)]
*  and keeping them there until the attacks. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=23.86s)]
*  Brigadier General Effie Daffran is a spokesman for the Israeli Defense Forces. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=26.52s)]
*  He joins us now from Israel with an update. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=32.16s)]
*  Welcome to Fox and Friends. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=36.56s)]
*  Tell us what's the latest that you're seeing, what we can expect maybe over the next 72 hours. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=38.04s)]
*  Well, good morning and thank you for having me. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  Thank you for this question. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=50.2s)]
*  Let me first at the outset describe to you what Iran means for us in Israel. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=51.32s)]
*  Iran is an existential threat to Israel. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=57.56s)]
*  They are for years they are developing their nuclear program, they are developing a missile [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=60.64s)]
*  program aimed to destroy Israel, and they are spreading terror all over the region. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=64.46000000000001s)]
*  Iran is now becoming a nuclear power. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=69.92s)]
*  It's only a matter of days and from the moment they will decide and they will reach their [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=72.72s)]
*  nuclear capability. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=75.82000000000001s)]
*  This is a very serious existential threat to Israel. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=76.82000000000001s)]
*  They actually, you know, they declare it out loud, all their leaders repeatedly, and we [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=80.44s)]
*  cannot afford having this threat on our necks, on our necks when they will have this nuclear [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=85.0s)]
*  power. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=90.63999999999999s)]
*  And the amount of missiles they are producing, this is an existential threat in addition [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=91.63999999999999s)]
*  to the nuclear problem. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  So this is what Iran is. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  Now in the last almost, I would say more than 24 hours, we launched an attack on Iran. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=98.91999999999999s)]
*  The aim of this attack is to dismantle Iran's nuclear, some of its elements or its nuclear [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=106.16s)]
*  component, some component in its nuclear program, which is aimed to destroy Israel, also their [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=113.67999999999999s)]
*  missile capabilities. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=120.16s)]
*  We have launched, as you described before, we have launched this attack. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=122.44s)]
*  We killed their military leadership. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=125.84s)]
*  Just to give you an example, one of those who died at the meeting you just described [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=128.96s)]
*  is Mr. Ali Khajizadeh. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=134.94s)]
*  He was the so-called Air Force commander of the IRGC, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=137.18s)]
*  This guy is an arque-terrorist. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=144.14000000000001s)]
*  He is responsible for spreading terror all over the world. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=145.82s)]
*  He's responsible for killing American soldiers on American bases all over the Middle East. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=149.22s)]
*  He is the one who ordered the attack on the Aramco petroleum facility in Saudi Arabia. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=154.42000000000002s)]
*  Above all, he is the guy who is responsible for what they call the plan for the destruction [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=162.46s)]
*  of Israel. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=169.54s)]
*  He is the guy who planned this plan. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=170.54s)]
*  He shared it with their proxies all over the region. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=172.82s)]
*  So for us, killing him and 30 more, about 30 of people like him means removing a serious [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=176.42000000000002s)]
*  threat on Israel. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=183.42000000000002s)]
*  Now moving on with your question, I would say we opened, we paved the way in the last [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=185.18s)]
*  few hours. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=192.42000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force has paved the way to Tehran, the capital of Iran. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=193.74s)]
*  Now we can act freely from West Iran all the way to Tehran. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=198.98000000000002s)]
*  The Israeli Air Force is acting now above Tehran and West Iran itself. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  So over the past 36, 48 hours, has there been anything that has happened either in terms [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=208.38s)]
*  of you all's initial attack or Iran's response that has surprised you? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=216.74s)]
*  Well, we made our assessments. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=224.78s)]
*  We are fully aware of Iran's capability. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=228.18s)]
*  I've described before their ballistic missiles capability. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=230.42s)]
*  They have much more than what they have launched so far. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=234.26s)]
*  Last night they have launched four barrages of missiles to Israel. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=239.01999999999998s)]
*  The difference between us and them, we are hitting, we are aiming at military targets [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=245.06s)]
*  and they are aiming at our civilian, you know, a center of civilian populated areas like [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=249.14s)]
*  the center of Tel Aviv. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=253.66s)]
*  So we are not surprised. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=255.78s)]
*  This is Iran. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=257.7s)]
*  Our air defense systems are the best in the world, as you know, Iron Dome, Arrow and so [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=258.7s)]
*  on and so forth. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=263.66s)]
*  But it's not perfect, you know, and some of those missiles hit the Tel Aviv and its outskirts. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=264.98s)]
*  We are ready for any other threat coming from post from Iran. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=271.90000000000003s)]
*  We are ready for more barrages like this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=275.66s)]
*  General Deferran, thank you for joining us. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=281.06s)]
*  I know this is a tumultuous time for your country. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=282.46000000000004s)]
*  Thank you for taking the time to join us today and speak to the American people because they're [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=284.54s)]
*  very concerned. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=287.5s)]
*  They want to know not just those in this country that support Israel, but those that have family [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=288.94s)]
*  and our own military. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=293.26s)]
*  So let's hope that this resolution comes quick. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=294.9s)]
*  Thank you for joining us. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=297.34s)]
*  Thank you for having me and we will prevail. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=299.82s)]
*  Justice will prevail. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=302.3s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=303.3s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=306.3s)]
*  All right, we'll be right back. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r34PhyCY_Ho&t=307.3s)]
