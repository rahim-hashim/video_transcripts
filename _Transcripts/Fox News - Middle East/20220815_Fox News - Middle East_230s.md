# Afghanistan one year later: Taliban at its strongest in over 20 years
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 15, 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0)
*  bring a retired US Army Lieutenant Colonel Bob McGinnis to discuss. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, watching that and then listening to all of the rights that have been taken [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=4.0s)]
*  back, one million children under five malnourished women covered when they go out, teenage girls [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=9.48s)]
*  can't have a public education. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=14.4s)]
*  There are a lot of families watching this and saying, gosh, you know, why do we do it? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=15.6s)]
*  Why do we lose so many people? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=20.32s)]
*  What do we do it for? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=22.0s)]
*  Yeah, Charles, no doubt we're worse off because of what happened a year ago today and for [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=24.6s)]
*  subsequent two weeks. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=30.840000000000003s)]
*  It was a strategic error, in my estimation. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=33.0s)]
*  The Taliban is back where it was 21 years ago. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=36.2s)]
*  And in fact, I would argue we've thrown an accelerant on our adversaries, Russia, China, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=39.88s)]
*  Iran, and others. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=47.16s)]
*  Yes, the optics are bad, not only from that day a year ago, but also for what you just [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=49.24s)]
*  laid out. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=55.96s)]
*  You know, they've, you know, they're starving to death. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=56.96s)]
*  And the Taliban has clamped down on women and clamped down on any dissent. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=59.480000000000004s)]
*  I mean, it's a very tragic situation that we didn't have to leave as we did. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=64.48s)]
*  We could have left a token for us, and they would have been far better off today than [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=72.32s)]
*  they were than they are today. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=77.48s)]
*  Yeah, instead, we just left a lot of weapons without the force. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=79.84s)]
*  Colonel, Colonel, again, as the Biden administration pointing to the drone strike that killed Top [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=84.0s)]
*  Al Qaeda leader, Zaruhari, as proof that the U.S. can keep terrorism in check from [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=88.64s)]
*  afar. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=93.12s)]
*  But what about the fact that he was actually living and hiding in plain sight in Afghanistan [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=94.44s)]
*  in the first place at the time of the strike? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, with the interior minister, at least a house that was associated with him, you [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=103.75999999999999s)]
*  know, that demonstrates clearly that the Taliban is back in bed with Al Qaeda. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=108.84s)]
*  Now, it's good that Zaruhari is dead, but the idea that we can conduct an over-the-horizon [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=113.39999999999999s)]
*  strategy against terrorists that are in Kabul and elsewhere is ludicrous. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=120.36s)]
*  The fact is that you have to have people on the ground that can identify the target and [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=126.0s)]
*  the exact location so that we can go after them. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=131.56s)]
*  And we don't have nearly the capability today because of abandoning that particular place. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=135.24s)]
*  And keep in mind also that Al Qaeda is not dead. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=141.52s)]
*  It is still prospering in Pakistan and elsewhere, and perhaps some have even come in our open [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=146.56s)]
*  southern border. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=153.12s)]
*  Before I let you go, we're going to run that now iconic video of the Afghanis chasing that [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=154.24s)]
*  US transport plane, some clinging, even falling to their deaths. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=161.36s)]
*  In addition to all the Americans, young treasures that we lost lives, did we also let down these [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=167.20000000000002s)]
*  people who bought into the notion that there could be an American-style democracy if we [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=173.32000000000002s)]
*  had stayed longer? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=177.88000000000002s)]
*  No, no doubt. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=178.88000000000002s)]
*  You know, we had been working for 20 years on nation-building there and, you know, fueled [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  that economy. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=186.20000000000002s)]
*  75% of the economy of Afghanistan was basically foreign grants, and a lot of that came from [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=188.04s)]
*  the United States. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=192.67999999999998s)]
*  That's all gone. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=193.67999999999998s)]
*  And the hope is gone in most of those people. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=195.2s)]
*  You know, fortunately, we were able to get out over 100,000 people, but those left behind [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=197.56s)]
*  have little hope of a prosperous future. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=202.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  Colonel McGinnis, always appreciate our conversations. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=206.67999999999998s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=208.92s)]
*  Thanks, Charles. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y1ibp1N1wR0&t=209.92s)]
