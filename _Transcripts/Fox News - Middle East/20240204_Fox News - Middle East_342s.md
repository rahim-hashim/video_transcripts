# The only thing Iran understands is pressure and force: Brian Hook
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU)
*  What is Iran's endgame? How does it benefit that country to provoke the U.S. to attack and kill [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=0.0s)]
*  U.S. soldiers? Iran is a closed country and the outside world rarely gets a glimpse inside. We [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  don't know much about the religious zealots who run the country or even the Iranian people. But [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=11.92s)]
*  our next guest is an exception to that. Brian Hook is a former State Department Special Envoy [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=17.28s)]
*  for Iran and he joins us now. Welcome Mr. Hook. What is Iran up to attacking U.S. soldiers and [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=22.96s)]
*  assets? And is it likely U.S. intelligence can directly link Iran or is there room for Iranian [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=29.68s)]
*  deniability in these most recent attacks? Trey, what Iran is up to is they are trying to get the [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=36.800000000000004s)]
*  United States out of the Middle East and that has been the objective of this theocratic regime [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=45.52s)]
*  for 41 years, ever since the Ayatollah Khomeini came into power. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=51.92s)]
*  Um, that has been their objective. They're a revolutionary regime and they are committing all [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=55.92s)]
*  of these, um, acts, attacks against American forces in the region in order to get our troops [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=62.0s)]
*  out. President Biden right now is conducting a failed foreign policy that is putting our troops [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=68.4s)]
*  in danger. There have been, our troops have been attacked over 200 times in Iraq and Syria [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=75.84s)]
*  during the Biden administration and the five American troops who have recently died is tragic [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=82.8s)]
*  and the president has got to reverse a failed foreign policy if for nothing else than to [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=90.24s)]
*  protect the 30,000 troops we have in the Middle East. It's hard for many, if not most of us, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  to grasp sitting down at the negotiating table with a country like Iran, but you've done it. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=104.56s)]
*  You did it on nuclear weapons and you've done it on hostages. So what does work as far as deterring [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=110.08s)]
*  Iran? The only language that Iran understands is pressure and force and President Trump put in place [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=116.56s)]
*  a campaign of maximum economic pressure. The president of Iran, while we were in office, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=125.12s)]
*  said that our sanctions cost the regime over $200 billion. Now the regime, if they had $200 [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=132.0s)]
*  billion, would have spent it on terrorism. They would have spent it on Hamas and Hezbollah [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=140.24s)]
*  and their proxies in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. But we denied the regime hundreds of billions of dollars [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=145.76s)]
*  and that was very effective at constraining their sphere of action in the region. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=154.24s)]
*  And unfortunately, the Biden administration has taken the exact opposite approach where they have [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=160.4s)]
*  given the regime $6 billion and the regime uses that money to then support Hezbollah [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=165.84s)]
*  and other proxies to attack American troops, Israel and our allies around the region. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=173.36s)]
*  So we were very successful at deterring Iran. There were no major attacks by Hamas or Hezbollah [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=180.8s)]
*  while we were in office. President Trump put in place a foreign policy that was very effective [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=188.56s)]
*  in the Middle East. He defeated ISIS. We took a number of terrorists off the battlefield, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  including Qasem Soleimani. But now the Middle East has gone back to the sort of the old Middle East [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=199.04s)]
*  of terrorism on an almost daily basis. All right, the Biden administration is calling for a two-state [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=205.6s)]
*  solution with respect to Palestine. You served in more than one Republican administration, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=214.8s)]
*  if my memory serves me correctly. So what is the answer to the conflict [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=219.60000000000002s)]
*  more broadly in the Middle East and in particular with respect to a Palestinian state? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=224.56s)]
*  Yeah, when I saw that the State Department was considering unilaterally recognizing [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=230.24s)]
*  Palestine, I didn't quite know what that means. I mean, right now, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=236.08s)]
*  72 percent of Palestinians supported the terrorist attacks of October 7th on Israel. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=241.36s)]
*  And so if the Biden administration were to recognize the state of Palestine, what are [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=247.28s)]
*  they recognizing? And what would they be emboldening? I mean, right now, the territories [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  of Palestine, half of it's controlled by Hamas, which is an organization we recognized as a [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=257.92s)]
*  terrorist organization. And then in the West Bank, you have something like over 80 percent [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=263.68s)]
*  of Palestinians supported the attacks on October 7th. And so I think the Biden administration is [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=269.76s)]
*  getting dangerously close to endorsing terrorism at this point. I mean, in this context, coming [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=276.32s)]
*  very, very shortly after the October attacks. I think this is the last thing that they should be [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=285.76s)]
*  talking about. If there is going to be an independent Palestinian state, it is only [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=291.52s)]
*  going to come through direct negotiations between Israel and Palestine. And right now, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=297.2s)]
*  the Palestinians do not want a two-state solution. They want to destroy Israel. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=302.79999999999995s)]
*  Brian Hook, thank you for joining us. The message is somber, but thank you for joining us on a Sunday [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=310.08s)]
*  night. And thank you for your service and multiple administrations. We'll see you next time. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=316.0s)]
*  Great. Good to be with you, Trey. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nn-tCc2-dPU&t=322.08s)]
