# More hostages released, share tearful reunion with families
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M)
*  Ukraine isn't the only war-torn country looking for peace. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=0.0s)]
*  In Israel, we have six remaining hostages have been released by Hamas as part of the [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=4.4s)]
*  phase one of the ceasefire deal. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=9.28s)]
*  The hostages were met by their families and friends, and they had a tearful reunion with [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=11.66s)]
*  their loved ones. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=16.68s)]
*  Reports say Israel is holding off on releasing more than 600 Palestinian prisoners, as Prime [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=18.36s)]
*  Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is set to hold security assessment tonight before deciding [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=24.28s)]
*  if the prisoners should be exchanged. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=30.36s)]
*  Now, Trump is supporting Mr. Netanyahu and called out the horrors of the hostage situation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=32.44s)]
*  Even though the hostages are coming back, I saw it this morning where we got six more [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=38.68s)]
*  back. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=42.84s)]
*  Biden got none back, by the way, just so you understand, none, zero. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=43.84s)]
*  He would have never gotten any of them back. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  But they're coming back in pretty bad shape. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=49.34s)]
*  It's a horrible thing, and many are dead. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=51.24s)]
*  I mean, it really is a horrible thing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=53.36s)]
*  And Tom, I'm going to start with you again. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=56.36s)]
*  I mean, it's certainly hard for anybody sitting at this desk to decide how this should be [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=57.8s)]
*  handled. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=62.2s)]
*  But for the sake of discussion, what do you think? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=63.36s)]
*  Again, you see the way he did it. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=65.56s)]
*  He's giving a speech. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=67.16s)]
*  He's the president of the United States. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=68.2s)]
*  But he's talking about the war in the way that you hear people talk about it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=69.84s)]
*  You know, people everywhere around the world, never mind in the Middle East, people in the [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=75.08s)]
*  United States, they're weary of this and they see this coming back. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=79.44s)]
*  You know, the terrible attack that happened. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=83.92s)]
*  And we've been seeing the response from Israel. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=87.4s)]
*  And now we're seeing maybe a glimmer of hope for peace. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=91.28s)]
*  But at the same time, we're seeing these terrible images coming back. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=95.26s)]
*  So President Trump, he's not really saying anything there other than saying this is a [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=97.72s)]
*  terrible situation and, you know, we're going to make it stop. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=101.44s)]
*  And President Trump is good for, you know, coming across as very unpredictable. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=105.32000000000001s)]
*  It has worked for him before because the enemies and unfortunately, sometimes the allies don't [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=112.67999999999999s)]
*  know what he's going to do. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=117.56s)]
*  But it makes people kind of stand up and pay attention. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=118.67999999999999s)]
*  I think his aggressivity in this situation is moving the needle. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=121.8s)]
*  But I have to be honest and say, as a Jewish person with a lot of friends and family over [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=124.8s)]
*  there, I find this whole topic so difficult because they're not militants, Hamas. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=130.16s)]
*  They're a brutal terrorist group. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=134.84s)]
*  They're going to continue to be a group that cannot be negotiated with. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=137.12s)]
*  Look how they parade people out. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=140.04s)]
*  They have people sitting in cars watching other other hostages be released while those [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=141.64s)]
*  people are not released and people applauding all of this. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  I can't imagine a solution here where Hamas remains in any kind of power or participation. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=149.76s)]
*  And I want to applaud you for bringing that particular aspect up, which is the human aspect. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=156.72s)]
*  We have people whose loved ones were horribly, horribly massacred and killed and tortured [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=162.44s)]
*  and continue to be tortured. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=168.92s)]
*  And so while we can sit here and talk about negotiations, we have to remember that people [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=170.44s)]
*  have suffered and even those who are back with their loved ones, they continue to suffer. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=174.83999999999997s)]
*  And this is a horrible situation and it needs to stop. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=178.67999999999998s)]
*  And you have to imagine that all of that is part of the conversations going on right now [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=182.39999999999998s)]
*  during the security assessment that they're having right now in Israel. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=186.28s)]
*  And also one other thing to keep in mind, and I'm sure this is part of the conversation as well, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=190.76s)]
*  Hamas is actually behaving in a more desperate way lately. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=195.56s)]
*  The savagery, the depravity is even worse, especially when you consider that they are [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=200.04s)]
*  now, they know that they are dealing with and partnered with a weakened Iran, a weakened [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=205.23999999999998s)]
*  Hezbollah, which is like practically non-existent right now because of what Israel has done. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=211.07999999999998s)]
*  So Israel is trying to figure out exactly where to move forward, but it's got to be so difficult [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=214.84s)]
*  when you see that they don't send the correct hostage back, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=219.39999999999998s)]
*  They do that. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=223.88s)]
*  And then they have other hostages sit there and watch other hostages being released. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=224.6s)]
*  It's just the list goes on. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=228.51999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's, you know, and again, we'll wrap with this and that is people over politics [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=229.72s)]
*  across the board in this horrible situation. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOt1zEq4c0M&t=235.16s)]
