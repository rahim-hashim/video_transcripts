# Ret. Brig. Gen. Teichert analyzes Biden's response to Iranian threats
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54)
*  So Iranian-backed militia groups fired multiple rockets at the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad Thursday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=0.0s)]
*  night. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=6.32s)]
*  It is only adding to concerns that the U.S. will be dragged deeper into the conflict in [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=7.32s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=11.8s)]
*  In just the last few weeks, there have been at least 85 attacks against U.S. bases, as [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=13.02s)]
*  well as new threats to international shipping. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=18.28s)]
*  Let's bring in John Tykert, retired U.S. Air Force Brigadier General and former Assistant [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=21.64s)]
*  Deputy Undersecretary of the Air Force. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  This attack on the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, that had to be greenlit by Iran, wouldn't [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=29.98s)]
*  you think? [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=36.26s)]
*  John, all of this that's gone on in the last two months has been greenlit by Iran. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=37.620000000000005s)]
*  Fortunately, there at the Embassy in Baghdad, there's an air defense system to help protect [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=42.86s)]
*  them. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=47.42s)]
*  My team brought that in when I was the senior defense official there in summer of 2020. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=48.42s)]
*  But all of these malign activities that are going on, including the 85 attacks and 70 [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=52.58s)]
*  Americans injured and one American killed, have all been prompted by an Iran that has [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=58.78s)]
*  not been deterred and frankly has been emboldened by a weakness of the Biden administration [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=63.74s)]
*  for the last three years. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=68.54s)]
*  So you don't think that the responses that we have made thus far, hitting ammo dumps [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=69.94s)]
*  and that sort of thing, not adequate in your book? [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  John, clearly not adequate because Iranian interests continue to attack American positions. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=78.14s)]
*  Those pinprick attacks, six or so, late, they've been weak and they've been accompanied by [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=85.42s)]
*  an apologetic tone by the Secretary of Defense. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=90.62s)]
*  And Iran is only convinced and deterred by strength capability, will and resolve. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=93.98s)]
*  And they've seen none of that by the United States in the last three years. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=99.5s)]
*  So what happens when finally Iran has nuclear weapons? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=102.34s)]
*  I mean, that's what they're working toward. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  It is, John. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=109.18s)]
*  They're only a few days away from a nuclear breakout, in part bankrolled by $150 billion [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=110.22000000000001s)]
*  of sanction relief by the Obama administration during the original nuclear deal. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=116.22000000000001s)]
*  And now they're using that $150 billion to sow seeds of malign activity and terrorism [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=121.54s)]
*  around the world and in the Middle East and to create a nuclear program that's on the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=127.26s)]
*  verge of a breakout. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=131.46s)]
*  The only way that we can stop them, number one, is to clamp down on sanctions and number [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=132.94s)]
*  two, to regain a deterrent posture that demonstrates American capability and will and resolve so [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=137.7s)]
*  that whatever capability the Iranians have, that it will be kept in check because they [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=143.73999999999998s)]
*  know that America will rightfully respond. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=147.98s)]
*  You heard the Israeli military leadership there saying that they think that Hamas is [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=150.26s)]
*  starting to weaken. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=154.78s)]
*  Do you believe it's possible to utterly destroy Hamas, which Israel says is its goal? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=155.78s)]
*  John, destroy and defeat are different terms. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=161.62s)]
*  We, as an example, have defeated ISIS, but we haven't destroyed them. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=165.7s)]
*  That means that they can't take or gain territory, that they can't mount a large scale attack. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=169.79999999999998s)]
*  But the idea that you can completely eliminate or eradicate an idea or an ideology is tough [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=175.88s)]
*  to consider or tough to conceptualize. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=182.54s)]
*  Ultimately, Israel's best interest is to defeat them so that they no longer can control Gaza. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=184.89999999999998s)]
*  They can no longer mount an attack like they did on the 7th of October. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  And ultimately, there will continue to be remnants of Hamas like there continue to be [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=194.22s)]
*  remnants of ISIS during the foreseeable future. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=197.48s)]
*  Retired Air Force Brigadier General John Tigert, thanks for your expertise. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kObVuUODf54&t=200.82s)]
