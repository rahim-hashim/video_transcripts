# Ted Cruz: This is evil and there is no moral equivalence
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc)
*  Senator, great to have you, my friend. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=0.0s)]
*  CHEERING AND APPLAUSE [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=2.0s)]
*  Everyone said before the show that if you were in their state, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=5.64s)]
*  they'd all vote for you, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=9.08s)]
*  So you got a lot of fans. Wow. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=11.08s)]
*  Well, God bless the great Americans in your audience. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=13.32s)]
*  They're fighting to save America. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=15.76s)]
*  Listen, they're almost like Texans. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=17.56s)]
*  They're the only normal people in New York, so, um... [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=19.36s)]
*  Well, come down, buy a ranch, get a horse, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=22.8s)]
*  live life in freedom. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=25.6s)]
*  And a new pair of cowboy boots and a hat, and I'm ready to go. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=27.64s)]
*  Great to have you. Amen. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=31.240000000000002s)]
*  Let's get your thoughts overall on what we see unfolding here [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=33.0s)]
*  and what needs to be done and what role the US should play here. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=36.88s)]
*  Well, what is unfolding in Israel is utterly horrific. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=40.52s)]
*  This is the most serious attack facing the state of Israel in 50 years. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=43.52s)]
*  This is... [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Saturday, October 7th, was the single biggest mass murder [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=49.44s)]
*  in a day of Jews since the Holocaust. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=53.6s)]
*  We have seen Palestinian terrorists committing horrific acts of murder, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=57.24s)]
*  going from home to home, targeting civilians, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=61.68000000000001s)]
*  murdering the elderly, murdering women, murdering children, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=64.12s)]
*  deliberately executing every member of a family, [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=67.44s)]
*  raping women, raping little girls, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=71.0s)]
*  burning and beheading infants. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=73.76s)]
*  It is evil. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=75.92s)]
*  There is no moral equivalence. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=77.36s)]
*  Everyone in the media, every Democrat who is saying [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=79.08s)]
*  Hamas and Israel are the same, they're not remotely the same. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=81.64s)]
*  And it is critical right now that we stand together, [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=85.24000000000001s)]
*  that every American says, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=88.28s)]
*  America stands with Israel 100% period, full stop, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=89.68s)]
*  for as long as it takes to utterly and completely defeat Hamas. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=95.12s)]
*  That's what it's going to take. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=100.68s)]
*  I know you've been to Israel many times. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=103.12s)]
*  I've been there. I was there during a flare-up, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=104.92s)]
*  and I've been to border towns with Gaza, and I've seen the carnage. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=107.44s)]
*  Kids in a sarot is what they call a little small town. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=111.04s)]
*  10,000 rockets were fired into that one little city in 10 years. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=115.88s)]
*  Little children, because it only takes 13 seconds [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=120.52s)]
*  for a rocket fired in Gaza to hit this watering town. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=123.12s)]
*  And so the kids have to play in underground playgrounds that are bunkers. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=127.48s)]
*  They can't play outside. They don't get vitamin D. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=132.76s)]
*  Very necessary for good health, right? [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=135.84s)]
*  I don't think people realize that any outcome, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=138.48s)]
*  doesn't it have to end any possible opportunity [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=141.51999999999998s)]
*  for the terrorists in Gaza to be firing there, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=145.16s)]
*  having a launching pad from there? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=149.48s)]
*  Look, absolutely yes. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=152.0s)]
*  You and I both know Prime Minister Netanyahu very well. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=153.72s)]
*  He has pledged to eradicate Hamas. That is the right thing. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=156.44s)]
*  And there are three things that are critical for us to do. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=160.0s)]
*  Number one, we need to cut off the money to Iran. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=162.68s)]
*  The Biden administration has flowed nearly $100 billion to Iran. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=166.84s)]
*  Joe Biden and his administration is in a very real sense funding this attack. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=173.08s)]
*  We need to cut it all off. We need to cut the $6 billion off. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=177.84s)]
*  That was a ransom for American hostages that basically set a bounty [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=180.84s)]
*  for Iran to go take more American hostages. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=184.88s)]
*  They said they had a secret deal. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=186.96s)]
*  How do you have a secret deal that you trust if it's not ratified by the Senate? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=188.56s)]
*  Well, look, they've been engaged in secret deals from the beginning. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=194.12s)]
*  Biden's number one foreign policy priority was to enter into another Iran nuclear deal. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=197.32000000000002s)]
*  But their answer is funnel billions of dollars into Iran. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=202.88s)]
*  The Ayatollah is a theocratic, homicidal, genocidal maniac [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=206.84s)]
*  who leads mobs and chanting death to America and death to Israel. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=212.08s)]
*  And if you look at the four pots of money that have gone to Hamas, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=216.12s)]
*  you've got the $6 billion to Iran. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=219.64000000000001s)]
*  You've got three weeks before that, $10 billion to Iran, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=221.79999999999998s)]
*  again, from the Biden administration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=225.0s)]
*  The biggest pot is $80 billion because Biden will not enforce the oil sanctions. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=227.04s)]
*  So Joe Biden and the Democrats are allowing Iran today to sell two million barrels of oil a day, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=234.2s)]
*  primarily to communist China. That is funding these Hamas terrorists. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=241.28s)]
*  And then the fourth pot of money is the Biden administration sent hundreds of millions of dollars [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=245.28s)]
*  into Gaza after the Biden administration had concluded there was a high likelihood [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=250.48s)]
*  that money would go to Hamas to fund terrorism against Israel. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=255.44s)]
*  We need to cut off all that money, no money for Gaza, no money for Iran. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=259.52s)]
*  Shut off their oil sales, starve them of cash. That's step number one. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=264.96s)]
*  Step number two, we need to fund Israel's defensive weaponry, the Iron Dome missile defense, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=268.71999999999997s)]
*  give them the weapons they need. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=275.36s)]
*  And then step number three, Israel is going to be demonized by Democrats and the corrupt corporate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=277.28s)]
*  media. We need to make clear that Hamas is using human shields and Israel has a right to defend [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=282.88s)]
*  itself. We need to stand up and speak the truth. I'm doing that every week on my podcast, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=289.84s)]
*  Verdict with Ted Cruz. You're doing that. Thank you, Sean, for speaking the truth. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=294.96s)]
*  Thank you, Senator Ted Cruz, for what you're doing and having more clarity. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ92vpeMOc&t=299.2s)]
