# Trump ‘very optimistic’ about Hamas ceasefire, State Department spokesperson says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8)
*  For more on other areas of Trump administration diplomacy, let's bring in State Department [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=0.0s)]
*  spokesperson Tammy Bruce. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=4.16s)]
*  Unless, Tammy, of course, you want to comment on that. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=5.16s)]
*  It sounded more like door advice, and he was clearly being very generous. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=7.44s)]
*  He obviously knows them, and yes, it was unfortunate. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=11.92s)]
*  I think it would be unfortunate for anyone in that situation, but as he said, I'm sure [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=16.12s)]
*  they're fine. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=19.64s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like at the end of the year, it'll be part of our year-end in video review. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=20.64s)]
*  We have just gotten, on the foreign policy front, we have just gotten a response to the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=25.32s)]
*  from Hamas, 10 living prisoners from Hamas, 18 bodies in exchange for an agreed-upon number [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=29.32s)]
*  of Palestinian prisoners. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=36.32s)]
*  They also say that their proposal, the Hamas proposal, they want a permanent ceasefire. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=37.56s)]
*  What updates can you give us about U.S. reaction to what Hamas has been saying? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=41.68s)]
*  Well, I can't talk about the details of something like this, obviously, regarding any diplomatic [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=45.36s)]
*  issues and negotiations that are going on. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=50.04s)]
*  We do know that Special Envoy Steve Woodcoff has been there. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=53.08s)]
*  That has been his focus. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=56.4s)]
*  The Trump administration's focus is to stop the carnage in that area, but there's only [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=57.519999999999996s)]
*  one reason why it continues, which is because Hamas will not lay down its arms, will not [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=61.68s)]
*  stop killing people, and will not release hostages, which is what any kind of normal [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=66.75999999999999s)]
*  civilized framework would allow. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=71.08s)]
*  So they are continuing this fight. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=73.64s)]
*  It would stop immediately if they simply agreed to being normal human beings, but they have [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=76.38s)]
*  not done it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=81.92s)]
*  The president's position and Secretary of State Marco Rubio's position is Hamas cannot [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=83.16s)]
*  continue to exist for obvious reasons, that this kind of fighting has to end after generations [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=87.75999999999999s)]
*  of wash, rinse, and repeat. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=93.32s)]
*  The president has called for new ideas, and it's because we've got to end the dynamic [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=96.52s)]
*  here. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=101.47999999999999s)]
*  But as we think about what Israel is doing, what it has to respond to, and even I would [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=102.47999999999999s)]
*  caution, you know, we are judging entities like Russia or Hamas, anyone who's in a position [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=106.6s)]
*  where we have to watch what they're doing is not, you know, it's not take them at their [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=112.5s)]
*  word. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=117.05999999999999s)]
*  We have to look at their actions. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=118.05999999999999s)]
*  So I would say we should watch, see what occurs here. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=119.05999999999999s)]
*  Obviously, also the president has demanded that all hostages are to be released. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=123.38s)]
*  So I think the world is watching and understands how fluid the situation is. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=128.1s)]
*  The president was very optimistic yesterday about a ceasefire, and that is when we can [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=133.66s)]
*  get more done. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=138.5s)]
*  But we need more aid and food to go into that region for the Gazan people, who are the first [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=140.94s)]
*  victims of Hamas, and why the world is demanding this end and why President Trump is determined [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=145.26s)]
*  to be a part of the ending of this carnage. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=150.3s)]
*  Turning now to the State Department vetting of people going to Harvard, international [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=153.22s)]
*  students and staff going to Harvard. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=156.7s)]
*  Why start with Harvard? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=159.7s)]
*  Well, you know, this is not just Harvard, right? [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=160.7s)]
*  This is about visa dynamics of how we're vetting people. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=163.57999999999998s)]
*  So this is going to be more schools? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=166.98s)]
*  Well, right now it's everyone who gets a visa, right? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=168.9s)]
*  I mean, if you're a student visa, or if you're coming in, if you need a tourist visa, if [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=171.7s)]
*  you're coming in to work, it's really been a hallmark of Secretary Rubio to make sure [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=177.14s)]
*  that the elements that we use to be able to vet people who want to come into this country [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=183.1s)]
*  for whatever reason, that we know who they are. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=187.45999999999998s)]
*  Every sovereign nation is allowed to determine who's in their country, who gets to stay, [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=189.85999999999999s)]
*  who doesn't, if they're not a citizen. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=196.06s)]
*  And in this case, the visa process, it's never really been talked about much, but it [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=198.02s)]
*  is our first front on the issue of national security. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=201.82000000000002s)]
*  Every visa is a national security action, and we vet people. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=205.26000000000002s)]
*  And while they're here, it's important to know, and this is a good reminder, that you're [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=209.70000000000002s)]
*  vetted when you get the visa, but when you're here, it doesn't mean we just kind of look [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=213.5s)]
*  away and forget. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=217.08s)]
*  It's not like you put somebody up in the guest room and then leave them alone. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=218.08s)]
*  You're always aware of what's happening here. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=221.0s)]
*  We're always watching to see if a circumstance has changed. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=223.5s)]
*  But primarily, it's knowing, especially with what we saw after October 7th, speaking of [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=226.94s)]
*  Israel, the nature of what emerged out of universities in this country, the Ivy League [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=231.9s)]
*  in particular, the Jew hatred, the anti-Semitism, the vandalism, the taking over of buildings, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=236.54s)]
*  the interrupting of education. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=244.02s)]
*  That is not what you are allowed to do if you are here as a guest. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=246.46s)]
*  Being here is not a right, it's a privilege, and visas are that first line of national [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=250.98s)]
*  security. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=255.86s)]
*  So if you're here now, if you want to come, it's worldwide, it is about student visas, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=257.78000000000003s)]
*  but everyone who wants to come here is vetted, and this is an important thing for visitors [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=263.54s)]
*  to realize, because everybody wants a peaceful, terrific experience in this country. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=268.62s)]
*  Is that a change though? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=274.18s)]
*  I mean, we've always vetted for visas. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=275.18s)]
*  I mean, the Harvard component is different. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=277.22s)]
*  It seems as though you are vetting those who want to come to Harvard more so than was done [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=279.42s)]
*  in the previous administration. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=284.76s)]
*  Are you saying that the administration is now vetting all visas to a higher standard? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, again, Harvard's in the news. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=290.58000000000004s)]
*  It's a big story. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=293.86s)]
*  It's perhaps an easy story to cover, but it's not just Harvard. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=294.86s)]
*  It is the nature of our ability to, again, know who's coming in, and perhaps when it [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=299.3s)]
*  comes to vetting, there are many tools in our tool chest. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=305.5s)]
*  We do know that it's worth checking visas as visas expire. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=309.70000000000005s)]
*  We've seen historically people don't necessarily leave when their visas expire. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=315.26s)]
*  We also are looking at the nature of what's been happening on campuses, but also when [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=318.54s)]
*  it comes to illegal immigration in general, but the nature of the actions we take to make [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=323.58s)]
*  sure that the people who are here know what's expected of them, that's the first thing, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=328.88s)]
*  and also for the American people. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=333.42s)]
*  They want to be able to live a life as citizens, knowing that people who should not be here [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=335.86s)]
*  or who are breaking our rules do not get to stay. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=340.58s)]
*  It's a very basic standard, so it's not just one school. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=344.22s)]
*  It's not just one category of people. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=347.86s)]
*  This is overall. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=350.1s)]
*  It's global, and it's America taking seriously what matters to us in our national security. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=351.22s)]
*  Were other administrations doing it this way? [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=357.38000000000005s)]
*  I can't speak to that. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=359.3s)]
*  I can speak to the Trump administration and to Secretary Marco Rubio and the SiriusNOW [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=360.5s)]
*  of what exists as the law, that we are simply doing what every sovereign nation has the [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=365.5s)]
*  right to do, and other nations do, and we're being vocal about it and we're demonstrating [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=371.16s)]
*  to people that this is the way we're operating. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=376.6s)]
*  That's what people have to think about. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=379.56s)]
*  Not what was done in the past, what we are doing right now. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=381.12s)]
*  I want to turn very quickly to Russia and Ukraine and a couple of soundbites. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=383.6s)]
*  One from Secretary Rubio. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=387.88s)]
*  On a trip that you and I were on in NATO when he said, in a few weeks we'll know, and then [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=388.88s)]
*  President Trump yesterday, what he had to say. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=393.52000000000004s)]
*  Here's that soundbite. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=395.52000000000004s)]
*  Sure. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=396.52000000000004s)]
*  We'll know soon enough, in a matter of weeks, not months, whether Russia is serious about [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=397.52s)]
*  peace or not. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=412.59999999999997s)]
*  It seems like we've been saying for months, weeks, when is this two-week timeline that [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=413.59999999999997s)]
*  keeps moving going to actually happen? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=419.0s)]
*  Well, it doesn't keep moving. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=420.91999999999996s)]
*  I think that what we have is a statement by both certainly the president recently and [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=422.35999999999996s)]
*  the secretary noting that this is not a long-term thing. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=426.52s)]
*  This is not simply standard operating procedure. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=430.32s)]
*  It's not going to go on for months or years that we had standards and benchmarks about [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=433.15999999999997s)]
*  what needed to occur. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=438.03999999999996s)]
*  Remember, President Trump's a businessman. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=439.44s)]
*  You go in with a goal in mind, and there's a point where you need to achieve that goal, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=441.47999999999996s)]
*  especially when every day matters. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=445.24s)]
*  Someone could be alive today and be dead the next day. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=447.84s)]
*  That is something obviously very serious, and they take it seriously. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=450.84s)]
*  What also happens in negotiations is progress is made. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=454.68s)]
*  You want to be able to, and you have negotiations 24-7, you want to be able to move forward. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  Things can change. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  In the meantime... [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=465.88s)]
*  Has there been progress? [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=466.88s)]
*  Well, I can tell you that obviously the president is hopeful. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=467.88s)]
*  He's an optimistic man, but we did see last week some very aggressive truth social posts [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=471.12s)]
*  about his disappointment with President Putin, that he knows that man. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=477.8s)]
*  He felt he had changed. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=481.8s)]
*  We are seeing, of course, actions from Russia, sending missiles and rockets in that are killing [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=483.56s)]
*  civilians during supposedly negotiations. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=488.1s)]
*  So that, of course, when we judge people by their actions, not by their words, it is disconcerting. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=491.32s)]
*  But now clearly in negotiations, which I can't remark on certainly or any diplomatic approaches, [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=497.2s)]
*  is that the president is being very public, that he feels that there's this new framework, [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=502.64s)]
*  this new timeline about when we would know if they are serious, and they'll make decisions [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=507.96s)]
*  accordingly. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=513.0s)]
*  But this is already, this has to be between the parties, between Ukraine and Russia, that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=514.0s)]
*  we are, gotten people to the table, and that they know what we are requiring, but it's [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=519.0s)]
*  really going to be up to them. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FZkQ6fZvRh8&t=523.9200000000001s)]
