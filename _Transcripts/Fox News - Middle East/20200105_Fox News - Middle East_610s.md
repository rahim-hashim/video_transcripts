# Has Iran become more aggressive during the Trump administration?
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU)
*  The secretary of state Mike Pompeo, welcome back to Fox News Sunday, sir. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=0.0s)]
*  Chris, it's great to be with you. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=4.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me on this morning. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=5.0s)]
*  You know that the Iraqi parliament is holding an emergency session today to discuss the [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  question as to whether U.S. troops, the 5,000 troops we have there, should remain in country. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=11.94s)]
*  It has just come across the wires. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=17.0s)]
*  The Iraqi prime minister says it is in the interest of both Iraq and the U.S. to end [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=18.56s)]
*  foreign troop presence in Iraq. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=24.36s)]
*  And he also says that the killing of General Soleimani and also a top militia leader who [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=27.04s)]
*  was backed by Iran, Mohandas, were political assassinations. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=34.76s)]
*  Your reaction, sir? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=38.879999999999995s)]
*  Well, Chris, American people should know that President Trump will never shy away from protecting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=40.36s)]
*  and defending America. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=44.379999999999995s)]
*  It's what we've done over these past weeks and days. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  It's what we've done over our entire three years with our Middle East strategy. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=48.36s)]
*  The activity that you're seeing today is fully consistent with that. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=51.96s)]
*  The American people should know we will continue. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=55.08s)]
*  The president tweeted it again last night. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=56.52s)]
*  We will take the actions necessary to keep Americans safe. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=58.52s)]
*  As for the activity today with respect to Iraq, we've been in their country, we've [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=62.160000000000004s)]
*  been supporting Iraqi sovereignty, we've been continuing to take down the terrorist [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=65.32s)]
*  threat against the Iraqi people. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  The prime minister is the resigned prime minister. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=71.16s)]
*  He's the acting prime minister. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=74.12s)]
*  He's under enormous threats from the very Iranian leadership that it is that we are [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=75.76s)]
*  pushing back against. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=79.48s)]
*  We are confident that the Iraqi people want the United States to continue to be there [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=81.32s)]
*  to fight the counterterror campaign and we'll continue to do all the things we need to do [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=84.88s)]
*  to keep America safe. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=89.32s)]
*  But if Iraq, it is a sovereign country, if they demand that we leave, one, will we leave? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=90.6s)]
*  And if we do, won't that dramatically hurt the fight against ISIS and stability in the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  region? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=100.19999999999999s)]
*  So we'll have to take a look at what we do when the Iraqi leadership and government makes [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=101.19999999999999s)]
*  a decision. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=105.16s)]
*  But the American people should know we'll make the right decision. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=106.16s)]
*  We will take actions that frankly the previous administration refused to take to do just [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=109.22s)]
*  that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=113.62s)]
*  President Trump says that General Soleimani was planning a quote, imminent attack against [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=115.02s)]
*  Americans. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=120.46s)]
*  You have said it was a quote, big action that could potentially kill hundreds of American [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=121.46s)]
*  diplomats and soldiers. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=126.74s)]
*  What was the plan? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=129.26s)]
*  Who were the targets and how soon? [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=130.57999999999998s)]
*  Yes, President Trump was right and what he said so was I. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=132.42s)]
*  We'll share all the intelligence that we can. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=136.26s)]
*  I was the C.I. director for a little while, Chris. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=137.94s)]
*  There's things we simply cannot make public about what it is we knew at the time and what [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=140.1s)]
*  in fact we know today about the continuing activity. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=143.82s)]
*  I think General Milley got it right when he said we would have been culpably negligent [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=146.38s)]
*  had we not gone after Soleimani when we had the opportunity. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=150.34s)]
*  He was actively engaged in plotting against American interest. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=153.42s)]
*  We need to look no further than what he had personally done over the days before that [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=156.94s)]
*  when an American was killed on December 27th. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=160.14s)]
*  There's no surprise. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=163.3s)]
*  I just want to press to this degree. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=164.3s)]
*  He had been targeting Americans and other people around the region for decades. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=173.46s)]
*  The blood of 600 Americans was on his hands during the Iraq war. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=179.14000000000001s)]
*  The question is that there are some intelligence agents who are talking to media outlets who [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=184.58s)]
*  Yes, he was doing bad things, but it was another day in the Middle East. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=191.18s)]
*  Some congressional leaders who have been briefed now say that the intelligence was not of an [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=195.66s)]
*  imminent attack that was bigger, more worrisome. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=201.82s)]
*  Don't the American people have the right to some understanding of what it was, why it [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=205.1s)]
*  was so urgent to take out Soleimani now? [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=209.82s)]
*  I haven't heard any of the congressional leaders who have seen the full set of intelligence [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=211.9s)]
*  make the comments that you just described. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=216.28s)]
*  I think any reasonable person who saw the intelligence that the senior American leaders [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=217.94s)]
*  had in their possession would have come to the same conclusion that President Trump and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=222.57999999999998s)]
*  our leadership team did about the fact that there would have been more risk to America, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=226.38s)]
*  more risk in action than there was through the action that we took. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=230.98s)]
*  I think it's very clear, I think it's very plain. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=233.62s)]
*  We'll do everything we can to share this information with the American people, but I think the [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=235.9s)]
*  American people understand too there are certain things you just can't put out in public. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=239.82s)]
*  You've got to protect Americans who are out collecting the intelligence. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=243.7s)]
*  The intelligence we will need in the days and weeks ahead to continue to defend and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=246.14s)]
*  protect them. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=249.77999999999997s)]
*  Iran's leaders are vowing a crushing response, using words like a hard revenge. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=250.77999999999997s)]
*  What do we do if they strike back, if they retaliate? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=258.34s)]
*  Is there a plan? [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=262.12s)]
*  And is there, because of the fact that we went after Soleimani, has there been a change [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=263.9s)]
*  in U.S. response where we're no longer going to go after the enemy in the field, we're [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=267.38s)]
*  now going to go after Iran's command and control? [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=271.46s)]
*  The American people know that there's a strategy, a strategy that has been several years in [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=274.78000000000003s)]
*  the making now, that we've been working on. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=278.18s)]
*  It's been a diplomatic strategy, it's been an economic strategy, you're now seeing elements [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=280.22s)]
*  of the military strategy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=283.96s)]
*  And with respect to targets, President Trump talked about 52 targets last night. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=285.96s)]
*  That's not new in the following sense. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=289.82s)]
*  We've made clear to the theocrats and kleptocrats that are running Iran today, running it into [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=291.38s)]
*  the ground against the will of their own people, we made clear to them that we would not respond [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=296.78000000000003s)]
*  just against these proxy forces that they run in Yemen and in Syria and in Iraq and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=301.2s)]
*  in Lebanon. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=306.12s)]
*  We made clear that this cost would be brought home to them, to the leadership regime in [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=307.12s)]
*  Iran and that we would raise costs. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=311.03999999999996s)]
*  We wouldn't just attack their asymmetric efforts, we would respond in a way that imposed costs [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=312.92s)]
*  on the decision makers who are putting American lives at risk. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=317.44s)]
*  So you're saying to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, you're saying to President Rouhani, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=320.44s)]
*  you're saying to leaders of the Revolutionary Guard, don't think that you're off limits? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=325.08s)]
*  What I'm saying is exactly what President Trump has said. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=330.08000000000004s)]
*  We will take responses that are appropriate and commensurate with actions that threaten [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=332.74s)]
*  American lives. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=336.34000000000003s)]
*  That's what we've done so far, Chris. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=337.34000000000003s)]
*  There's no reason that the American people or the Iranian regime should ever expect we'll [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=338.88s)]
*  do anything different. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=342.84000000000003s)]
*  You talk about the strategy. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=344.34000000000003s)]
*  The president has been pushing what he calls the maximum pressure strategy since he took [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=346.6s)]
*  office. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=351.92s)]
*  He pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=352.92s)]
*  He imposed tough economic sanctions. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=356.20000000000005s)]
*  This summer, he suggested that the strategy was working. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=358.84000000000003s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=361.76s)]
*  Iran is a much different country than two and a half years ago. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=362.76s)]
*  When I took over, Iran was all over. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=368.12s)]
*  They had 14 to 18 different sites of confliction. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=370.28000000000003s)]
*  They were all over. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=374.8s)]
*  And now they just want to negotiate a deal so badly. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=376.84000000000003s)]
*  In 2019 alone, Iran hit six ships, shot down a US drone, launched an attack against Saudi [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=382.92s)]
*  oil facilities, a damaging attack. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=390.32s)]
*  And for all the talk of isolating Iran, they just conducted joint exercises with China [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=392.68s)]
*  and Russia. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=396.8s)]
*  So the question is, has the president's maximum pressure strategy made Iran less aggressive [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=397.8s)]
*  or more? [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=404.98s)]
*  Panic aggression. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=406.64s)]
*  Are they part of the Iranian leadership because they know that the Iranian people are demanding [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=407.64s)]
*  enormous change and they know that the Iranian people are supported by America in that demand [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=411.58s)]
*  for change. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=416.38s)]
*  We built out a huge coalition, Chris. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=417.38s)]
*  Gulf states, Israel, countries all across the world who are joining us. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=419.09999999999997s)]
*  They're joining us not only in the efforts in the straits of Hormuz but in air defense [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=422.62s)]
*  efforts all across the region. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=426.06s)]
*  The malign actor of Iran has been identified. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=428.21999999999997s)]
*  Remember where we came in, Chris. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=430.86s)]
*  Remember where we came in. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=431.86s)]
*  In 2015, the Obama-Biden administration essentially handed power to the Iranian leadership and [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=433.06s)]
*  acted as a quasi-ally of theirs by underwriting them, underwriting the very militias that [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=439.22s)]
*  killed Americans. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=443.5s)]
*  Those resources, the money that they had to build out those forces throughout the Shia [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=444.82000000000005s)]
*  Crescent was provided to them by the nuclear deal. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=448.42s)]
*  We allowed Europeans to go do business there. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=451.18s)]
*  We provided them $150 billion pallets of cash. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=453.1s)]
*  All of these things are the very challenge that the Trump administration has had to correct. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=455.70000000000005s)]
*  The strategy is working. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=459.74s)]
*  We're going to stay the course and we will protect and defend the American people at [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=460.74s)]
*  every step, Chris. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=464.18s)]
*  So you know, I will be asking Senator Van Hollen about that in the next segment. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=465.18s)]
*  President Trump also says that he is keeping his campaign promise to pull U.S. troops out [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=470.1s)]
*  of the Middle East. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=475.90000000000003s)]
*  Here's what he had to say in October. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=477.38s)]
*  The plan is to get out of endless wars, to bring our soldiers back home, to not be policing [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=480.7s)]
*  agents all over the world. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=486.9s)]
*  It was a quick hit, except they stayed for almost 10 years. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=488.14s)]
*  Let someone else fight over this long bloodstained sand. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=492.74s)]
*  But just this week, this week, the U.S. deployed 100 Marines to the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=499.06s)]
*  plus 750 to the region and now another 3,500. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=505.38s)]
*  Is the president pulling us out of endless wars in the Middle East or with his action [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=509.98s)]
*  this week, did he take a big step back in? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=514.1s)]
*  Endless wars are the direct result of weakness. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=517.72s)]
*  President Trump will never let that happen. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=521.26s)]
*  We're going to get it right, we're going to get the forced posture right, we're going [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=523.1s)]
*  to get our facilities as hardened as we can possibly get them to defend against what Iran [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=526.38s)]
*  may potentially do. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=530.78s)]
*  But make no mistake, America's mission is to have our footprint in the Middle East reduced [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=532.3s)]
*  while still keeping America safe. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=536.38s)]
*  Safe from rogue regimes like the Islamic Republic of Iran and from terrorist activity broadly [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=538.02s)]
*  throughout the region. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=543.8199999999999s)]
*  So is it fair to say that while the big strategy is to pull the U.S. out of endless wars, at [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=544.8199999999999s)]
*  least in the short term, that could be more of a commitment? [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=549.5s)]
*  The Obama administration created enormous risk to the American people in Iran. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=553.98s)]
*  This administration is working to reduce that risk. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=558.24s)]
*  Finally, some analysts suggest that the impeachment of President Trump has emboldened enemies [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=561.9s)]
*  like Iran and North Korea to think that they can confront him. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=568.88s)]
*  Do you think that as misguided as it may be that some of our enemies think that this [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=573.54s)]
*  president is more vulnerable because of the impeachment effort? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=579.9399999999999s)]
*  You should ask Mr. Soleimani. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=584.54s)]
*  I understand that, but he was going ahead before you killed him and the question is [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=588.3399999999999s)]
*  do you think that impeachment is emboldening our enemies? [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=591.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=595.78s)]
*  I think that our adversaries understand that President Trump and our administration will [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=596.78s)]
*  do the right thing to protect American people every place that we find risk. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=601.74s)]
*  Secretary Pompeo, thank you. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=605.66s)]
*  Thanks for coming out on a very busy weekend. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-obZds-_KU&t=607.7s)]
