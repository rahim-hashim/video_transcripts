# US needs to get ready before things get worse: National security expert
**Fox News - Middle East:** [July 31, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI)
*  So there is a ton going around here. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=0.0s)]
*  Let's just talk about this with Robert Greenway, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=2.2800000000000002s)]
*  director of the Center for National Defense [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=4.2s)]
*  at the Heritage Foundation. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=6.38s)]
*  Robert, I don't know where you begin, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=7.54s)]
*  but perhaps you can give us your best clue [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=9.44s)]
*  as to what happens next. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=11.38s)]
*  Go for it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=12.88s)]
*  Well, first, I think it's Israel sending a strong message [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=14.72s)]
*  to Hamas that the individuals responsible [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=17.56s)]
*  for the deadliest attack in their history, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=19.72s)]
*  the deadliest attack on Americans since 9-11, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=21.36s)]
*  is not safe anywhere, including Tehran. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=23.96s)]
*  At an IRGC guesthouse outside of Tehran, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=26.46s)]
*  the Iranian capital, and they've demonstrated [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=29.5s)]
*  the ability again to strike with precision. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=31.86s)]
*  Likewise, in Lebanon, you can see that they've sent [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=33.94s)]
*  a strong message to Hezbollah, taking out the number two, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=36.88s)]
*  and the man most responsible for the rocket [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=39.34s)]
*  and missile force, the greatest threat, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  displacing 80,000 Israeli civilians. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  And so as they wait for what happens next, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=44.92s)]
*  I think now we're looking at an Israel [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=47.019999999999996s)]
*  that is on high alert. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  I think it's gonna take days before Iran and Hezbollah [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  can organize themselves and prepare a response [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  to what they did not anticipate, [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=56.36s)]
*  and I think the region is on edge. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=58.059999999999995s)]
*  Unfortunately, the United States isn't playing the role [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  that it ought to in preventing escalation, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=62.04s)]
*  nor managing escalation. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=64.2s)]
*  I think it's time for the United States [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=65.74s)]
*  to get off the sidelines and to start to confront Iran [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=67.8s)]
*  before this gets out of hand. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=70.24s)]
*  Robert, to that point, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=71.62s)]
*  said this. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=74.68s)]
*  I don't think war is inevitable. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=77.12s)]
*  I maintain that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=79.56s)]
*  I think there's always room and opportunities for diplomacy. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=80.88s)]
*  We're gonna work hard to make sure [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=84.52s)]
*  that we're doing things to help take the temperature down [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=86.02s)]
*  and address issues through diplomatic means. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=90.54s)]
*  Just thinking back a few months ago, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=94.44s)]
*  I believe it was April when Iran sent [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=95.94s)]
*  all those missiles overnight, remember? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=98.0s)]
*  And the Iron Dome was able to deflect most of them. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=99.88s)]
*  That could happen again. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=103.48s)]
*  Is Israel replenished? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=104.58s)]
*  Are they able to take care of that situation again [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=106.32s)]
*  if it happens? [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=108.32s)]
*  Yeah, so 320 combined missiles and drones [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=110.48s)]
*  from three different vectors came into assault Israel. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=112.88s)]
*  They were successful at doing so with the US support [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=115.33999999999999s)]
*  and those of our partners and allies. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  I think it could be repeated, but not if it's sustained. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=119.11999999999999s)]
*  And the inventory from Iran was substantial, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=122.08s)]
*  but not from Lebanon. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=124.47999999999999s)]
*  Under the circumstances, it could be significant. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=126.17999999999999s)]
*  Right now, the United States has to provide [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=128.56s)]
*  the requisite support for Israel. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=130.4s)]
*  Certainly has to continue to provide the new munitions [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=132.01999999999998s)]
*  which have been delayed, [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=134.45999999999998s)]
*  and has to send a strong message to Iran. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=135.44s)]
*  We should be applauding, not questioning, not escalating, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=137.56s)]
*  not questioning Israel's actions. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=140.04s)]
*  Again, taken on behalf of ourselves, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=142.04s)]
*  again, knowing the Americans were killed on October 7th, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=144.36s)]
*  and the man killed outside of Beirut was responsible [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=146.56s)]
*  for the 1983 embassy bombing and 241 dead Marines. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=149.1s)]
*  We owe them our gratitude and our support, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=152.54s)]
*  not our questioning and not our equivocation. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=154.34s)]
*  Okay, there are more headlines coming out of Tehran, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=156.44s)]
*  and we'll get that to our viewers momentarily. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=158.48000000000002s)]
*  Here is, you know, the backdrop of all this [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=160.58s)]
*  is an American election that's some 90-some odd days away. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=163.94s)]
*  Here is Donald Trump and how he says that foreign countries [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=167.06s)]
*  will look at a Kamala Harris presidency. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=170.34s)]
*  He said this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=174.73999999999998s)]
*  I think they'll walk all over her. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=176.28s)]
*  She'll be so easy for them. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=177.64s)]
*  She'll be like a play toy. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=179.78s)]
*  They look at her and they say, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=182.01999999999998s)]
*  we can't believe we got so lucky. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=183.12s)]
*  They're gonna walk all over her. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=185.57999999999998s)]
*  And I don't wanna say as to why, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=187.32s)]
*  but a lot of people understand it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=189.32s)]
*  The contrast here, Robert, is that, you know, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=191.45999999999998s)]
*  you had a period of peace, relatively speaking, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=194.66s)]
*  three and a half years ago. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=197.54s)]
*  And I don't know what Kamala Harris does. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=199.28s)]
*  And I don't know what Joe Biden does right now, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=201.64s)]
*  but it seems that you've got this co-presidency [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  out of the White House. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=205.57999999999998s)]
*  What would you expect their lead to be now? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=206.72s)]
*  I think defensive. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=210.62s)]
*  They've been largely responsive. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=211.62s)]
*  It's hard to tell exactly who's in charge these days. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=213.06s)]
*  And what we've seen from Kamala Harris [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=215.66s)]
*  is essentially an endorsement of Biden's policies, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=217.29999999999998s)]
*  not surprisingly. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=219.56s)]
*  I do know that after the Soleimani strike, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=220.7s)]
*  that restored deterrence just four years ago, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=222.45999999999998s)]
*  she tweeted out that it was an unsupported strike, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=225.1s)]
*  that we were outside of bounds, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=227.5s)]
*  and that escalation and conflict would follow. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  So I think the region's interpreting [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=231.20000000000002s)]
*  that they've got a target of opportunity [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=232.58s)]
*  and the United States is going to constrain Israel [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=234.3s)]
*  and not confront them. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=236.54000000000002s)]
*  And so far they've been right. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=237.78s)]
*  I hope we can prove them wrong. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=238.9s)]
*  There was a push this past week for a hostage release deal. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=240.58s)]
*  Do you think this sets that back? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=244.46s)]
*  I doubt that that was actually close to conclusion [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=248.94s)]
*  at any rate, and certainly now there's gonna be very little, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=251.34s)]
*  if any, discussions about a hostage exchange. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=253.78s)]
*  And look, I think at the end of the day, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=255.9s)]
*  the conflict right now requires the hard responses [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=257.5s)]
*  that Israel has done to set their adversaries back. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=260.94s)]
*  I think now we need to support our partners and allies [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=263.46s)]
*  in the region with strong deterrence. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=265.82s)]
*  We can resume those negotiations at some point, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=267.18s)]
*  but it's not gonna be anytime soon. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=269.62s)]
*  Last question here about what we're doing on all this [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=271.5s)]
*  and the threats that we're facing around the world. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=274.46s)]
*  Lloyd Austin was in the Philippines [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=277.02s)]
*  when we heard that soundbite. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=278.58s)]
*  And the reason he goes to the Philippines [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=280.06s)]
*  because of the threat there on behalf of the Chinese. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=281.56s)]
*  And he's asked about this attack half a world away. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=283.66s)]
*  Here's the Commission on National Defense Strategy [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=286.58000000000004s)]
*  as to whether or not we are prepared for the next war. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=289.1s)]
*  The threats the United States faces are the most serious [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=292.62s)]
*  and most challenging the nation has encountered since 1945. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=294.86s)]
*  And include the potential for near-term major war. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=297.90000000000003s)]
*  The United States last fought a global conflict [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=300.82000000000005s)]
*  during World War II, which ended nearly 80 years ago. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=302.94s)]
*  The nation was last prepared for such a fight [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=306.06s)]
*  during the Cold War, which ended 35 years ago. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=308.5s)]
*  It is not prepared today. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=311.68s)]
*  How do you assure Americans watching now [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=313.86s)]
*  that we can get it together? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=316.82s)]
*  Well, it's a great question. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=321.34000000000003s)]
*  And we came to the exact same conclusions in January [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=322.42s)]
*  when we published Heritage's index of US military strength. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=324.82s)]
*  And so we agree. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=327.78000000000003s)]
*  And at the end of the day, [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=329.14s)]
*  our regional presence also doesn't disturb escalation [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=330.18s)]
*  or does it enable us to prepare for a response. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=333.22s)]
*  We've got a lot of work to take care of the negligence [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=335.38s)]
*  that has led to a decline in our military capabilities [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=337.98s)]
*  across the conventional nuclear spectrum. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=340.42s)]
*  And our job is to point out those deficiencies. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=342.46000000000004s)]
*  It'll take congressional and executive action to fix it, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=344.5s)]
*  but it needs to happen before the situation gets worse. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=347.02000000000004s)]
*  And escalation in the end of the day [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=349.42s)]
*  comes as a result of weakness. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=350.94s)]
*  We've got to be strong in the face of it [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=352.62s)]
*  if we're gonna expect a successful deterrence. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=354.22s)]
*  Amen to that. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=356.42s)]
*  Terrific, Robert. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=357.74s)]
*  Nice to have you on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=358.66s)]
*  Robert Greenway back with us today. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=359.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqsaLAJgHWI&t=372.42s)]
