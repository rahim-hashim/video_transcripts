# ‘Iran could try anything’: Experts warn US bases may be targeted
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4)
*  For more, let's bring in former ambassador to Iraq in Turkey James Jeffrey and former national security advisor to Vice President [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=0.0s)]
*  Dick Cheney and Jewish Institute of National Security of America senior fellow [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=7.2s)]
*  John Hannah gentlemen welcome to both of you. Thank you, Mike [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=11.44s)]
*  So I want to play a sound bite from Senator Roger Marshall on why Israel felt like it had to go now [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=14.84s)]
*  And I'll get you to react to it [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=20.44s)]
*  Everyone needs to realize that Iran was just one week away from having a nuclear warhead that over the past several weeks [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=22.56s)]
*  They've increased their 60 percent enriched uranium to over 600 pounds [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=29.16s)]
*  It wouldn't and they have all the equipment that necessary to get that to a nuclear warhead grade just in one week's time [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=33.68s)]
*  So I think the time was of the essence [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=40.28s)]
*  Ambassador, what's your assessment of the back-and-forth we've seen between Israel and Iran over the past couple of days [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=43.2s)]
*  Israel as the senator said was justified in doing it not only because of the capabilities Iran was showing but also the [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=49.16s)]
*  Intention ever since October 7th 2023 Israel cannot risk [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=57.080000000000005s)]
*  Assuming that countries that might want to attack [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=62.56s)]
*  Israel will not so I'm with Israel on this one [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=66.32000000000001s)]
*  Former CIA director and Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta weighing in let's play him and I'll get you to react [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=69.60000000000001s)]
*  It's very difficult to go after their enrichment facilities and their nuclear [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=75.72s)]
*  Facilities because those are really tough targets to get at so the question mark here is [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=83.2s)]
*  Yes, we're they're now hitting Iran, but are they able to truly go after their nuclear enrichment? [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=90.60000000000001s)]
*  capability [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=98.48s)]
*  John what about that question? What about the sophistication of this attack the Israelis have pulled off on strategic targets and also key [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=99.72s)]
*  members of the regime [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=108.28s)]
*  Yeah, it's been [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=109.96000000000001s)]
*  Extraordinary we knew the Israelis were incredibly a capable partner, but what they've pulled off here [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=111.68s)]
*  Similarly to what they did with Hezbollah last September an absolute [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=119.4s)]
*  Unbelievable 10-day campaign to take out the most powerful terrorist proxy in the world and now they've again [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  Taken Iran completely by surprise [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=132.96s)]
*  Decapitated a significant portion of its senior military command nine of its most important nuclear [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=135.08s)]
*  Scientists and now they've got complete controls over the skies of Western Tehran [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=143.36s)]
*  The question is can they get to those the most deeply buried? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=148.88s)]
*  Enrichment site at Fordow or does that require? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=153.4s)]
*  Somebody else to come in and finish the job which is the only country capable of doing that the United States of America [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=156.88s)]
*  Ambassador the regime in Tehran has called this in [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  Declaration of war are you bracing for the fact that this conflict may not end anytime soon [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=167.16s)]
*  It may not but this war didn't begin three days ago with Israeli strikes [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=172.88s)]
*  It began when Iran after 79 launched its march through the region [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=177.8s)]
*  pursued nuclear weapons and declared that [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=183.8s)]
*  Its goal was to wipe out Israel after again October 7th Israel has decided it'll take people at its word [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=186.76s)]
*  Iran's well known for its terrorist proxies throughout the region John [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=194.48s)]
*  Are you bracing for the possibility that American targets and Israeli targets will be hit by some of those terrorist proxies? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=198.24s)]
*  Throughout the region a lot of the proxies have been deeply weakened by Israel already [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=206.16s)]
*  I do think we need to fear that Iran Iran has already threatened that [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=211.24s)]
*  America for defending Israel against some of these ballistic missile attacks that our bases could be [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=215.84s)]
*  Targeted now by Iranian ballistic missiles and drones. I think that's a serious worry [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=222.76000000000002s)]
*  I think we're well postured to defend against it [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=227.44s)]
*  But I think Americans ought to be prepared that if in extremists if the Iranians are really worried about the fate of their regime [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=230.32000000000002s)]
*  They could try and anything [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=237.24s)]
*  including coming after our forces and trying to get get us into this fight with which I think would be a [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=239.56s)]
*  Absolutely fatal mistake for the Iranian regime. That's already in a very bad position [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=245.28s)]
*  We know there were supposed to be talks tomorrow and Oman the Trump administration says it's still committed to talks [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=250.24s)]
*  President Trump has held out the hope that maybe at some point the Iranians will come back to the table to make a deal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=255.52s)]
*  What about that? It's possible and I would like to underline [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=261.68s)]
*  President Trump put a very forward-leaning [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=266.16s)]
*  Deal on the table. We don't know the details, but it looked like at least some temporary continued enrichment [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=269.44s)]
*  Even though he denied it in other words [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=275.72s)]
*  He offered Iran an exit strategy the fact that Iran didn't take it. I think is [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=277.40000000000003s)]
*  Another reason why the Israelis decided they had to strike. What about negotiations happening anytime soon John your thoughts [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=283.40000000000003s)]
*  As I think the Iranians are in for a lot of hurt the Israelis just today have started [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=290.64s)]
*  Expanding to economic targets to going after Iran's any energy sector, which is the only thing holding up that [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=295.35999999999996s)]
*  Economy and I think there are a lot of nervous senior officials in Iran worried about regime stability [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=302.47999999999996s)]
*  I think their only exit ramp right now is the one that President Trump is offering them to get back into a [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=309.4s)]
*  Negotiation and get serious about ending that doing what's required to end that nuclear [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=317.32s)]
*  Program and have your regime survive and maybe get a little bit of sanctions relief to rebuild this economy [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=322.56s)]
*  Which is absolutely on its on its back [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=329.08s)]
*  I was covering the White House during the Obama years and I remember the Iranian people taking to the streets and there was criticism [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=331.28s)]
*  That President Obama didn't jump on that opportunity to encourage them [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=337.56s)]
*  Do you think the Iranian people may rise up? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=341.76s)]
*  Against the regime. I think you may see protests, but we've seen the ability of this regime to put down [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=345.08s)]
*  Public protests in the cities and the countryside from as you said 2009 on [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=352.88s)]
*  but again [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=358.24s)]
*  The regime worried about its survival is a good place to have it be [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=359.92s)]
*  That's where it is right now and it may as John said open the door to a compromise solution [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=364.68s)]
*  John final thought on regime change or what's next? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=371.53999999999996s)]
*  Listen, yeah [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=375.42s)]
*  Elon Musk has gone up with Starlink now to allow the Iranian people in Iran to communicate with each other [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=376.14s)]
*  That's an important move. I think we just need to be ready [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=383.34s)]
*  We need to be ready to support Iran [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=387.42s)]
*  The former Shah's son has reached out to the Iranian people saying this war was brought by the mullahs [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=389.18s)]
*  And now it's time for us to take our fate into our hands [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=396.03999999999996s)]
*  We don't know what will happen [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=399.21999999999997s)]
*  But I think the Israelis are prepared to go a long way if the Iranians are not willing to come come to heel and give [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=400.78s)]
*  Up that nuclear program if they keep firing at Israel, there's no telling where this ends for Iran [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VwmFoLjU0K4&t=406.97999999999996s)]
