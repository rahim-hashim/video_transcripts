# Hamas hostage crisis ‘not over yet,’ says father waiting for son
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA)
*  Joining me now is Adi Alexander, the father of Israeli-American hostage, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=0.0s)]
*  Edan Alexander, who is still being held by Hamas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=5.08s)]
*  Adi, thank you for your time today, and our prayers obviously continue [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=8.64s)]
*  for you and your family and for Edan as well. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=12.4s)]
*  I just want to share for the folks at home who haven't had a chance to see it, this is [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=15.76s)]
*  from the president. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=18.68s)]
*  He made a post this morning, it says Hamas has just released three hostages [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=19.72s)]
*  from Gaza, including [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=24.2s)]
*  an American citizen. He goes on to say, they seem to be [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=25.64s)]
*  in good shape. This differs from their statement last week that they would not [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=29.3s)]
*  release any hostages. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=32.9s)]
*  Israel will now have to decide what [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=34.34s)]
*  they will do about the 12 o'clock today deadline imposed on the release of all [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=37.5s)]
*  hostages. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=42.5s)]
*  The US will back the decision they make. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=43.22s)]
*  Your reaction to what the president had to say there? I say we keep going with the [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=46.260000000000005s)]
*  deal. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=51.34s)]
*  I mean, this deal, it's not perfect. As you see, every week it's [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=51.86s)]
*  it's taking too long and the hostages being released in a good shape sometimes, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=57.26s)]
*  in a bad shape the other, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=62.34s)]
*  and we can't get them any tips and grips. We have to get a bunch of them out, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=63.7s)]
*  hopefully all of them out in a shorter term. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=68.86s)]
*  You know, I'm sensitive to the sadness that you must have felt [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=72.78s)]
*  over all this time, and yet I'm also understanding that, and I'm sure Americans [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=77.3s)]
*  do, how frustrating this must be, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=82.66s)]
*  especially when you compare and contrast what's happening now [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=85.26s)]
*  compared to what happened in the last administration. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=88.62s)]
*  Yeah, it took too long. I mean, this deal was ready back in December of 2023. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=92.34s)]
*  It's very important for viewers to know that, [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=97.74000000000001s)]
*  and it took almost more than a year to nail this down, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=101.5s)]
*  thanks to President Trump and his toughness, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=106.38s)]
*  but we, I mean, it's [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=109.38s)]
*  it's not over yet. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=113.22s)]
*  We have to get everybody out. My son is still there. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=115.53999999999999s)]
*  Hopefully between now and two weeks from now, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=119.66s)]
*  we will see him out as well. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=124.41999999999999s)]
*  So many people are frustrated and yet remain hopeful, as do you, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=127.14s)]
*  that your son is safe and will be able to be released. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=130.34s)]
*  While I have you, let me just run this by you. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=133.74s)]
*  This is the president talking about running Gaza. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=135.62s)]
*  It's an interesting idea to change the paradigm in that area. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=138.62s)]
*  Let me share the sound and get your reaction quickly on the backside. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=142.58s)]
*  We're not going to buy anything. We're going to have it. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=147.46s)]
*  We're going to keep it and we're going to make sure that there's going to be peace [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=149.54000000000002s)]
*  and there's not going to be any problem and nobody's going to question it. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=152.82000000000002s)]
*  And we're going to run it very properly. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=156.9s)]
*  And eventually we'll have economic development at a very large scale, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=159.82000000000002s)]
*  maybe the largest scale on that site. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=163.70000000000002s)]
*  Listen, Addie, I've been covering this story throughout my career, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=166.54000000000002s)]
*  and it's the first time that I can remember that a major leader in this world [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=170.22s)]
*  has decided to try to float an idea that's completely different. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=175.02s)]
*  And if cooperated with leaders in the region, it just might work. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=179.06s)]
*  What's your reaction to what the president is proposing? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=184.38s)]
*  First of all, we don't doubt his sincerity. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=187.82s)]
*  I mean, we have to take the president seriously, not literally. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=190.94s)]
*  This strategy might work. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=195.9s)]
*  But again, this strategy and this idea is good for the second phase of the deal, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=198.82s)]
*  but we have to be concentrated on the first phase to extend the first phase, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=205.22s)]
*  to get everybody out and just to pass it over the finish line. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=210.18s)]
*  That's beautifully said. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=214.94s)]
*  If you had one message for the president, for the White House [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=216.54s)]
*  and for all the negotiators who are working tirelessly, Addie, at this hour, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=220.26s)]
*  in an attempt to bring home your son, what would that message be? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=224.7s)]
*  The message is really simple. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=228.34s)]
*  We have to keep this issue front and center. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=229.58s)]
*  Don't forget that it was 45 Americans killed on that day on October 7th of 2023. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=232.42000000000002s)]
*  We have to push harder, pass it over the finish line. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=239.38000000000002s)]
*  We have so many hostages to go to waiting to be out. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=242.86s)]
*  And that's a very important issue, humanitarian issue. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=248.70000000000002s)]
*  Indeed. It is such an important issue. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=252.82000000000002s)]
*  I know that we're all watching very carefully and very hopeful and prayerful [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=254.94s)]
*  for the return of Idan. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=259.26s)]
*  Addie Alexander, thank you so much for your time today. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=261.1s)]
*  Continued blessings to you and yours, and let's hope for a very good ending very soon. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=263.22s)]
*  Thank you for your time. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmUkvZznDuA&t=267.9s)]
