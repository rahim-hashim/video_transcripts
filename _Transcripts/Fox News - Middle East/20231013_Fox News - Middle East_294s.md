# Ex-Hamas official trying to entice 'lone wolves' to act: Jonathan Gilliam
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A)
*  Former Navy SEAL, former FBI special agent Jonathan, how do you take this? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=0.0s)]
*  Is this simply a call to protest or is it a call to something much, much worse? [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=5.16s)]
*  Well, Todd, you know, honestly, it doesn't really matter what how I take it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=11.88s)]
*  It's how those people who support the propaganda that's coming out of Hamas and you have to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  remember Hamas is born from Iran, basically. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=25.72s)]
*  So whatever propaganda Iran is putting out there, and I do hold them pretty much accountable [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=29.24s)]
*  for this, is what is going to be important to the people who are likely to carry out [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=34.879999999999995s)]
*  an attack. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=41.599999999999994s)]
*  And that's what we have to realize. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=42.72s)]
*  Todd, we mix all these people into different categories or different groups, al-Qaeda, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=44.68s)]
*  ISIS, the Taliban, Hamas, Iran. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=51.84s)]
*  But the reality is it's all one group. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=55.86s)]
*  It's fundamental Islamic radicals who want to get rid of Israel. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=58.44s)]
*  They either want a regional or a global domination. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  And this is just another example of one in the same. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=68.52s)]
*  It's just a different place in the world. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=73.75999999999999s)]
*  And right now what's happening with this call to arms, almost basically as you would call [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=75.88s)]
*  it, is that they're trying to instigate lone wolves. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=81.28s)]
*  And as we see here with these protests, people who truly do not understand the problem, but [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=84.96s)]
*  they're altruistic and narcissistic like most people in the world now, and they believe [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=91.0s)]
*  that this is a cause that they need to jump on when they really don't understand what's [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=95.72s)]
*  happening. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=100.24s)]
*  Well, look, protests are one thing, but I got to hop on a train at Grand Central Station [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=101.24s)]
*  a couple blocks away here in about four hours. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=104.24s)]
*  How should I and every American in a heavily populated area approach today? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  So I wrote a book in 2017 called Sheep No More, The Art of Awareness and Attack Survival. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=114.04s)]
*  And I'm not here to pump that book, but I'm here to pump what the book has to say, because [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=119.0s)]
*  I wrote it when I saw in the military and in law enforcement that there was a gap between [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=123.64s)]
*  what we know and what the people know. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=130.16s)]
*  And the biggest part of that awareness that we have in the military and law enforcement [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=132.88s)]
*  is that you, Todd, Carly, and everyone else that's watching this can look at your surroundings [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=139.38s)]
*  from the attacker's point of view. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=146.66s)]
*  And if you can understand that these people are not rocket scientists, they just exploit [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=149.04s)]
*  vulnerabilities and avenues of approach that are open to them, and they take advantage [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=156.1s)]
*  of those things. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=162.1s)]
*  If you understand that you can see your world the same exact way, then you will be able [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=163.14s)]
*  to forward think everything that they do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=167.96s)]
*  And if you don't feel safe, not just tomorrow, because if nothing happened today, if nothing [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=170.92000000000002s)]
*  happens today, what about tomorrow? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=175.18s)]
*  What about the next day? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=177.64000000000001s)]
*  It's possible for this to happen anytime. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=178.94s)]
*  So you shouldn't be paranoid, but you should be aware. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=181.46s)]
*  And the way you do that is by looking at your life and every sector from the attacker's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=183.96s)]
*  point of view. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=188.84s)]
*  Understood. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=189.84s)]
*  Alexandria Hoff listed off all the ways various cities are preparing. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=190.84s)]
*  that we're taking a proactive approach today. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=195.52s)]
*  But are we prepared as a nation to prevent a terror attack? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=198.62s)]
*  Or have we become just too complacent? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=204.02s)]
*  And again, nothing's on the radar as of now. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=205.74s)]
*  We need to be clear. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=208.24s)]
*  We don't want to be alarmist. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=209.24s)]
*  But to the underlying question, are we prepared? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=210.36s)]
*  Well, when law enforcement tells you that there's no known threat, what they're telling [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=213.4s)]
*  you is that as far as we know, nobody's going to try to attack, right? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=218.56s)]
*  So that doesn't really give me comfort in any way, shape or form, nor did it when I [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=222.22s)]
*  was in the FBI. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=225.94s)]
*  But I just got back from overseas. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=227.98s)]
*  I was in Belgium for a period of time, and all over the place, really. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=229.74s)]
*  I was all over Europe. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=233.98s)]
*  And I'm here to tell you that the United States, Israel and all of Europe, and really the world, [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=235.26s)]
*  has fallen under this illusion that because there's been an expansive time between attacks, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=240.86s)]
*  safer than we used to be, and that the government or whoever's government, whether it's United [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=248.58s)]
*  States or anywhere else, is going to be the first responders for us. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=254.38000000000002s)]
*  The reality is you are your first responder. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=258.18s)]
*  And we are in a crisis in this world because—and I am a little alarmist because I've seen [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=260.74s)]
*  it all over the place. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=267.14s)]
*  People are not aware of their surroundings. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=268.54s)]
*  They've gone back to sleep and forgotten that this enemy exists. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=270.90000000000003s)]
*  And as you pointed out earlier in the show, the red-green alliance, that's the alliance [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=275.94s)]
*  between radical or fundamental Islam and communism. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=281.02s)]
*  It still lives. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=286.06s)]
*  Jonathan, you have the expertise and the fact that you're concerned should concern every [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=287.5s)]
*  American. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=291.7s)]
*  Jonathan, thank you very much. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=292.7s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT4nm7LJW6A&t=293.7s)]
