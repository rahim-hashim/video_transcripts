# China is the ‘ultimate big winner’ here: Rep. Mike Waltz
**Fox News - Middle East:** [August 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58)
*  The aforementioned next guest is Congressman Michael Waltz of Florida, former Green Beret. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=0.0s)]
*  You do not mess with Mike. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=5.2s)]
*  Congressman, what do you think of what's going on? [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=6.96s)]
*  And whether, I don't want to get ahead of myself here, whether this delay or whatever [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=10.24s)]
*  you want to call it or hold off on the part of Iran in the response to these attacks on [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=15.36s)]
*  top Hamas and Hezbollah bigwigs is clinging to maybe a ceasefire agreement between Hamas [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=21.62s)]
*  and Israel. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  In other words, could that, if it were secured, delay or maybe not happen? [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=31.700000000000003s)]
*  Any response by Iran? [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=38.86s)]
*  Neil, I have a different theory on Iran's delay here, and I think it has everything [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=40.86s)]
*  to do with Israel and Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=46.82s)]
*  I think it's Bibi that is deterring Iran right now because just a few weeks ago they had [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=49.58s)]
*  a house in the middle of Tehran under the protective umbrella of the IRGC during a presidential [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=57.339999999999996s)]
*  inauguration go boom and take out Hamas's political leader, Haniyeh. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=64.28s)]
*  And that sent a very strong message to the Ayatollahs that if we can get him, despite [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=69.9s)]
*  all of that security, we can get any one of you. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=75.14s)]
*  If you take this too far. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=78.76s)]
*  And then what happened the last time Iran launched hundreds of drones and missiles at [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=80.32000000000001s)]
*  Israel? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=84.76s)]
*  Israel was asked and pressured to restrain itself by this administration, but they sent [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=86.60000000000001s)]
*  a missile in and took out a site right on the cusp of Iran's most secure nuclear facility [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=93.30000000000001s)]
*  at Natanz. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=100.52000000000001s)]
*  So I think it's actually been Bibi's strong action that has made Iran think twice. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=101.9s)]
*  But what is so frustrating to me and so many of us, and I know with President Trump and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=107.4s)]
*  the Trump administration, if you take a step back, just four years ago, ISIS largely defeated. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=113.06s)]
*  Iran broke their currency and economy in shambles. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=119.46000000000001s)]
*  In fact, we had reporting back then that Hezbollah, Hamas and the Houthis were complaining they [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=122.44000000000001s)]
*  weren't getting any money from Iran. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=127.56s)]
*  And you have, of course, had the Abraham Accords. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=130.42000000000002s)]
*  And look where we are today. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=133.52s)]
*  And what Lucas Tomlinson was referring to is China is the ultimate big winner here. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=134.52s)]
*  They're getting massive amounts of oil and gas on the cheap from Iran. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=140.76000000000002s)]
*  And in return, Iran has the entire Middle East in flames. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=145.08s)]
*  And once again, our military is sucked in in a huge way to another Middle East conflict, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=149.4s)]
*  to where we're pulling missiles, aircraft carriers, fighters all out of the Pacific [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=157.32s)]
*  where they should be deterring China and are sucked into this conflict in the Middle East [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=162.88s)]
*  that has no end until this administration shifts its Iran policy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=167.88s)]
*  As long as Iran is flush with cash, you will not have peace in the Middle East. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=174.04s)]
*  You will not have stability. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=178.56s)]
*  And Xi Jinping is smiling all the way to the bank. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=180.51999999999998s)]
*  Iran isn't flush with as much cash, though, Congressman. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=185.04s)]
*  Oil prices, ironically, through this, actually dating back to the October 7th Hamas attack [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  on Israel, are down substantially. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=193.23999999999998s)]
*  You would think, given the skittishness that boosted U.S. naval presence all around the [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  Middle East, that oil prices would be shooting up. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=199.92s)]
*  They're not. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=204.32s)]
*  Now, not that they're great telegraphs of activity down the road. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=205.32s)]
*  Oftentimes, they've missed them both completely. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=209.32s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  Because that's the currency for so much of what Iran does in funding its proxies, to [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=213.07999999999998s)]
*  say nothing of Vladimir Putin, to say indirectly China itself, that that is not working out [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=216.55999999999997s)]
*  the way they had hoped. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=223.2s)]
*  But, Neil, what do you make of it? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=224.2s)]
*  Yeah, but, Neil, Iran is selling its oil and gas on the black market. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=225.2s)]
*  There's a whole black market economy, not just for Iran's oil and gas, but also for [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=229.35999999999999s)]
*  Russia's, as it pumps it through. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=233.39999999999998s)]
*  And that's what's thriving. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=235.44s)]
*  That's what you're saying is thriving regardless, right? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=236.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=239.2s)]
*  So they're making, they're still making great margins. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=240.2s)]
*  It's fueling their economy. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=241.84s)]
*  It's fueling terrorism. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=243.04s)]
*  It's fueling Putin's economy. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=244.8s)]
*  Another huge point of frustration, we passed secondary sanctions on Chinese buyers of all [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=247.28s)]
*  of this illegal oil, and Schumer won't take it up. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  Got it. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=256.16s)]
*  Congressman, always good seeing you. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=257.16s)]
*  Thank you as well for your incredible service to this country. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Hv0bQaiK58&t=259.32s)]
