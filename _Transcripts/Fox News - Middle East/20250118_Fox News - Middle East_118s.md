# Middle East situation is ‘extremely delicate’ despite cease-fire deal
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0)
*  We're going to start with our friend Trey Yanks, who is in Tel Aviv. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=0.0s)]
*  Trey Yanks, so we have this deal, obviously, with Hamas. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=3.44s)]
*  I have a couple of questions for you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=7.76s)]
*  First of all, I think it's important for the American people to know that the prime minister [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=9.52s)]
*  of Israel is not like a president of the United States, particularly in Israel, where you [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=13.68s)]
*  have all these fractured parties, these tiny parties, where three or four or five out of [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=18.0s)]
*  120 members of the Knesset can bring down a government, correct? [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=22.8s)]
*  Absolutely. And that was the prime minister's big challenge as he got this deal together with the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=26.4s)]
*  help of the Americans, the Qataris and the Egyptians. There were far-right members of [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=31.12s)]
*  the coalition who said, look, if the hostages get released, we have to be able to go back [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=35.36s)]
*  into war against Hamas. And that's some of the details of what we'll talk about in this agreement. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=40.4s)]
*  And in fact, they can go back, if I've read correctly from the various published reports, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=45.6s)]
*  it's three phases. And if Hamas does renege or starts shooting missiles into Israel and so forth [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=50.4s)]
*  and so on, Israel has the right to go in and do what Israel needs to do, correct? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=57.2s)]
*  Absolutely. And President-elect Trump has made clear through his team on the ground in the [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=62.08s)]
*  Middle East that if Hamas does break the ceasefire agreement, the Israelis will have the support [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=66.24s)]
*  of the incoming American administration to take the battle back against Hamas. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=71.36s)]
*  This is extremely delicate. And Friday morning, after a night of celebration in both Israel and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=75.76s)]
*  Gaza about an agreement, things started to fall apart. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=81.44s)]
*  through his office released a statement saying Hamas was going back on the agreement that was [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=86.48s)]
*  hammered out in Doha, Qatar. Negotiating teams were able to sit back at the table and iron out [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=90.96000000000001s)]
*  some of those last details. And it looks like Sunday afternoon, we will see the first hostages [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=96.88000000000001s)]
*  released from Hamas captivity along the Gaza border. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypZ-Cf4ski0&t=102.72s)]
