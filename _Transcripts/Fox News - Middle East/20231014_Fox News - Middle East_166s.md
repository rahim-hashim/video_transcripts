# This is far worse than anything I’ve seen: Retired Navy SEAL
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0)
*  We're back with the Fox News alert. Israeli forces hitting key Hamas targets in the Gaza Strip as a massive ground invasion seems imminent. So what would it look like and how could it play out? Let's ask retired Navy SEAL and recon Marine vet Mike Sorrell. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=0.0s)]
*  Mike, thanks for being here. What would it look like? And especially with Hamas discouraging its people from leaving the northern part of the Gaza Strip? [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=18.0s)]
*  Well, Hamas has always utilized civilians as human shields. And what Israel is trying to do with these warnings to vacate is to rob them of that ability and aid their distinction between non combatants and civilians. But what will this look like? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=27.0s)]
*  Let's use Fallujah, the Battle of Fallujah context, which is one eighth the size of Gaza. Similar to coalition forces gave one month for the people to vacate the area so that only Al Qaeda was was left. It took six weeks to clear that city, resulting in 100 coalition lives. So this is house to house, block to block and urban combat, as we know, seen waste city and on is deadly. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=42.0s)]
*  And that's and Fallujah without the massive underground tunnel complex that exists in Gaza. Is it possible, Mike, that we could be looking at a massive buildup as a precursor to a hostage rescue that maybe it isn't an all out because Israel knows what it would take to go house to house in the Gaza Strip. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=67.0s)]
*  With such a densely populated area right now as they start and as you said, the ground wars imminent as they go into to northern Gaza, special operations will probably be in tow if not supporting the infantry on the ground, waiting for further Intel as they find and fix hostages. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=86.0s)]
*  And they do very specific, precise raids to get as many hostages out as possible. But with the densely populated area, it's like trying to find a needle in the haystack. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=104.0s)]
*  Mike, I mean, someone with your experience and context, have you seen anything as complex is what the Israeli forces are fighting here? [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=112.0s)]
*  No, Pete. This is far worse than what we faced in Iraq in the Battle of Ramadi and Battlesodder for me, which I was wounded in the Battle of Ramadi. It's deadly. It's fierce. And my prayers go out to the IDF who is prepared. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=121.0s)]
*  The IDF is well trained in urban combat. They live in this environment. Remember the Lebanon conflict of 2006 where they gained a lot of experience. So they're not new to this. They're well trained. You've probably worked with them. I've worked with them. They're a professional army. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=134.0s)]
*  Mike, you know your stuff. Thank you for your service to our country and your expertise this morning. We appreciate it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=148.0s)]
*  Thanks, Pete. Thank you. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=153.0s)]
*  Thank you, Mike. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rrFE7rCEzp0&t=164.0s)]
