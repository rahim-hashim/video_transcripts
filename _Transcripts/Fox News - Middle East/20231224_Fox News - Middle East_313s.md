# Biden admin planned to keep Chinese spy flight secret from public: Report
**Fox News - Middle East:** [December 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE)
*  Our tensions growing for the U.S. as forces in the Mideast, the Houthi militants, have [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=0.0s)]
*  been targeting more cargo ships. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=5.32s)]
*  As recently as yesterday, as an Iranian commander now reportedly threatening to shut the Mediterranean [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=7.2s)]
*  Sea down. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=13.32s)]
*  It comes and more than 100 U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria have been attacked by Iranian-backed [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=14.56s)]
*  militias. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=22.52s)]
*  Fox News contributor and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo joins us now. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=23.84s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, great to have you on the program. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=28.36s)]
*  You know, I'm curious, from the beginning of the war between Israel and Hamas, we have [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=30.16s)]
*  talked about this war metastasizing, growing into something bigger. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=34.2s)]
*  Nation-state conflicts including Iran, perhaps others like Hezbollah. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=39.4s)]
*  It seems to have done so but only sort of through proxy, behind the scenes. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=43.84s)]
*  Has that gone how you expected and what you're seeing from Iran? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=47.900000000000006s)]
*  Well, Will, good morning. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=51.28s)]
*  It's a special day, Christmas Eve. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=54.400000000000006s)]
*  Thanks for having me on today. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=56.839999999999996s)]
*  It's gone, I suppose it's gone about as one would expect. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=58.36s)]
*  The Iranians often fight this way, right? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=62.839999999999996s)]
*  They can go after Americans while we go after non-Iranians. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=65.16s)]
*  We go after their proxy forces all around the world. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=68.64s)]
*  We respond to them in a defensive fashion and it allows them to essentially fight without [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=70.98s)]
*  putting themselves at any risk. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=76.46s)]
*  So it doesn't surprise me that we've had this many attacks on the United States when an [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=78.7s)]
*  administration like the Biden administration is as weak as it has been for the three years [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=83.64s)]
*  it has been this week. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=87.83999999999999s)]
*  This risk always accelerates. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=89.36s)]
*  The bad guys, the Iranians, well, they only understand one thing, they understand power. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=91.44s)]
*  And so long as we are announcing that we stop two of the three drones or we successfully [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=95.72s)]
*  foiled a plot somewhere in Europe, that's music to the Iranians' ears because that kind [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=101.03999999999999s)]
*  of defensive, back-footed posture increases risk not only to Israel, not only to the Gulf [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=105.36s)]
*  Arab states, but to folks around the world and Americans here at home as well. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=111.36s)]
*  If that is the tactic, and as you point out, it's been the tactic for quite some time, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=115.67999999999999s)]
*  then is the threat to potentially shut down the Red Sea a real threat? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=118.8s)]
*  Can that be accomplished through proxies? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=122.8s)]
*  Certainly. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=125.52s)]
*  It'll be difficult for them to do, but you know these locations, right? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=127.63999999999999s)]
*  You know the Strait of Hormuz. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=131.24s)]
*  Everybody's now become familiar with the Bab al-Mandeb, which is the southern entrance to the Red [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=133.76s)]
*  Sea. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=136.95999999999998s)]
*  It doesn't take much to not just shut it down. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=138.04s)]
*  You don't have to do it physically. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=140.44s)]
*  You just make the risk high enough that commercial ships won't travel through there. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=142.04s)]
*  Already some of the big shippers have decided to divert their cargoes around Africa instead [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=145.68s)]
*  of going through the Red Sea. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=150.04s)]
*  Very expensive. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=151.56s)]
*  A lot more manpower required. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=152.56s)]
*  That'll come right home to the United States of America in terms of higher costs. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=154.4s)]
*  They can do it if the United States isn't serious about pushing back against the Iranians. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=158.16s)]
*  If we allow the Houthis, these guys in Yemen, to just launch these Iranian rockets and threaten [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=162.04s)]
*  the world, and we don't go after them. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=167.0s)]
*  If we don't take out the places from which these rockets were launched and more, this [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=168.96s)]
*  is only going to increase and the risk is only going to become even greater. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=172.32000000000002s)]
*  Well, okay, I'm fascinated with your response to this question. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=176.12s)]
*  We had the discussion early on today in Fox and Friends. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=178.28s)]
*  So Embassy News is reporting the secret U.S. effort to track, hide and surveil the Chinese [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=180.88s)]
*  spy balloon. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=185.76000000000002s)]
*  That's the headline inside of the article. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=186.76000000000002s)]
*  It has the following quote. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=188.4s)]
*  It says, before it was spotted publicly, there was the intention to study it and let it pass [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=189.4s)]
*  over and not ever tell anyone about it. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=193.92000000000002s)]
*  They weren't paying attention. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=196.68s)]
*  So the Biden administration wasn't going to share with the American public the existence [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=197.84s)]
*  of this spy balloon. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=201.0s)]
*  There just seems to be more to this story than we understand. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=202.0s)]
*  You know, as I look at this and I try to analyze why would they have taken this approach, you [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=205.8s)]
*  know, it's either, yes, they did want to study it and that's why they were going to let it [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=210.6s)]
*  fly and they had some ability to limit the amount of intel it could gather, or they were [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=214.68s)]
*  just highly embarrassed by the entire situation and wanted to hide it in that way. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=219.36s)]
*  I just can't figure out why they would have chosen the path they chose. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=223.6s)]
*  Is there an explanation that we haven't yet discussed on the way this went down with this [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=228.12s)]
*  Bible in? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=231.9s)]
*  Well, there are certainly things that happen that for a moment, intelligence agencies and [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=234.9s)]
*  American intelligence agencies rightfully ought not to share with the American people [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=238.88s)]
*  if you're trying to make sure you keep them safe. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=241.92s)]
*  This certainly couldn't become one of them when we had live pictures of it. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=245.4s)]
*  Moreover, my sense here is that the reason that they didn't want to disclose this wasn't [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=249.12s)]
*  for intelligence collection. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=252.88s)]
*  You'll recall their first story is this wasn't this wasn't even spying on the United States. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=253.96s)]
*  This was just a lost weather balloon. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=258.68s)]
*  And then the story was that this happened in the Trump administration. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=260.64s)]
*  That the story keeps varying. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=263.28000000000003s)]
*  My guess is that in the end, they made the decision not to share with the American people [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=265.08s)]
*  out of sheer embarrassment that they had permitted this very dangerous activity to take [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=268.36s)]
*  place over the American homeland. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=272.48s)]
*  That's never a reason not to share information with the American people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=274.52s)]
*  I don't know if this story is true, but we remember they allowed a Chinese spy balloon [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=278.12s)]
*  to fly over our country for five days and did nothing. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=282.84s)]
*  And frankly, now we are months and months and months later. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=285.44s)]
*  They've still done nothing about this. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=288.32s)]
*  They've never even brought this up to Xi Jinping saying this is unacceptable to violate [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=289.76s)]
*  American sovereignty in that way. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=293.64s)]
*  All right, Mike Pompeo, thank you so much for being with us this morning. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=295.52s)]
*  Merry Christmas to you. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=298.23999999999995s)]
*  Well, Merry Christmas. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=299.2s)]
*  Blessings to you as well. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  Take care. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xQkxVjoV2VE&t=301.67999999999995s)]
