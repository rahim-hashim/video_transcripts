# Jason Chaffetz: Maybe it’s time we start telegraphing what we’re going to do
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw)
*  All right, so we're going to keep monitoring this White House press briefing. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=0.0s)]
*  John Kirby at the microphone. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=2.56s)]
*  Kareem Jean-Pierre will step up a brief time from now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=3.56s)]
*  But on that misidentified drone and the reporting on it, John Kirby saying he cannot confirm [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=6.88s)]
*  that is what happened. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=12.08s)]
*  John will await more details on that. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=13.72s)]
*  But on responding to the attack, what you just heard from John Kirby on behalf of the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=15.36s)]
*  administration, there's no easy answer. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=20.2s)]
*  We do not seek escalation or another war, and the U.S. will respond at a time of its [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=23.2s)]
*  choosing. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=28.44s)]
*  But it certainly takes you back to all the moments where this president warned, don't, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=29.44s)]
*  John. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=34.800000000000004s)]
*  And now many, many, many attacks later, the question over how we are responding continues [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=35.92s)]
*  to get bigger. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=41.96s)]
*  And how many times over the last number of months did we say the president can say don't [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=42.96s)]
*  all he wants? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=47.260000000000005s)]
*  Iran's not listening. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=48.260000000000005s)]
*  It's telling its proxies to keep up the attacks. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  And one of these days, Americans are going to get killed, and now it's happening. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=51.96s)]
*  This banner IRGC feels these attacks are worth the risk. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=56.68s)]
*  Jason Chaffetz still on set with us, John. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=59.96s)]
*  You had a strong reaction when you heard that. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=61.879999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=65.24s)]
*  They're looking at the risk versus the reward, and they're not seeing a whole lot of risk [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=66.24s)]
*  to continuing with these attacks. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=70.2s)]
*  There's never been a consequence that they can't tolerate. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=71.88s)]
*  So 160 attacks, people that are now dead. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=74.96s)]
*  I'm tired of Admiral Kirby coming up there and telling us the president's going to give [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=78.88s)]
*  an appropriate response. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=83.22s)]
*  How about a disproportionate response? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=84.88s)]
*  How about standing up saying we are the United States of America? [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=87.08s)]
*  You're not going to be pushing us around and have such an overwhelming response that Iran [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=89.88s)]
*  can't handle it, can't afford to do this yet again. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=94.75999999999999s)]
*  Until the president takes that kind of posture instead of appeasement, instead of making [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=98.36s)]
*  sure they get all the money and we go easy and we just proportionally do it, our troops [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=102.52s)]
*  will be in danger. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=106.94s)]
*  OK, back to the briefing room. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=107.94s)]
*  Jackie Heinrich is now asking questions of Kirby. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=109.03999999999999s)]
*  Let's listen. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  The proper way forward is to get the supplemental past. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=112.68s)]
*  And then in response to MJ's question earlier, it sounded like the administration has ruled [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=116.92s)]
*  out strikes within Iran. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=121.68s)]
*  Jackie, I appreciate the question. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=123.28s)]
*  I think you can understand. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=126.28s)]
*  I hope you can understand. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=127.28s)]
*  I'm not going to telegraph punches here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=128.28s)]
*  We are not looking for a war with Iran. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=129.76000000000002s)]
*  We are not looking to escalate the tensions any more than they already have been escalating. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=131.92000000000002s)]
*  In fact, everything we've done has been designed to try to de-escalate those tensions. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=135.56s)]
*  That said, this was a very serious attack. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=139.96s)]
*  It had lethal consequences. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=142.28s)]
*  We will respond and we'll respond appropriately. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=144.24s)]
*  I'm not going to telegraph what that's going to look like. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=145.96s)]
*  The question, though, was if you were actively considering targets inside Iran and your answer [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=148.0s)]
*  was we don't see conflict with Iran, which indicates that the administration would view [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=151.76s)]
*  strikes within Iran as escalatory. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=156.28s)]
*  And so is it that the administration ultimately does not hold Iran responsible for these attacks [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=159.64s)]
*  or that the current level of risk and loss to U.S. troops is somehow acceptable? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=165.3s)]
*  I do appreciate the question and the chance to say it again. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=169.32000000000002s)]
*  I am not going to telegraph punches for the president of the United States. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=173.8s)]
*  I'm not going to get ahead of his decision space and how he's going to respond. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=176.84s)]
*  We'll respond appropriately. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=180.32000000000002s)]
*  And you're right. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=182.08s)]
*  This attack had lethal consequences, which these attacks in the past have not had. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=183.84s)]
*  And as I said in my opening statement, as we work through what those options are, we'll [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=189.56s)]
*  be mindful and informed by the fact that there are now three American soldiers that [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=194.8s)]
*  have been killed. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=200.4s)]
*  So it's clear, obviously, that don't didn't work. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=201.4s)]
*  Does the president have any regret over not punching back harder in any of the prior responses [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=204.32000000000002s)]
*  that he's taken to these proxy attacks on U.S. forces? [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=210.96s)]
*  I think I would push back on the idea that we didn't push back harder, that we have taken [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=216.36s)]
*  significant action against Iran economically. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=222.24s)]
*  We have certainly taken some additional and more aggressive steps to go after these groups. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=225.8s)]
*  We're certainly taking aggressive action against the Houthis to try to defend shipping in the [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=232.44s)]
*  Red Sea. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=237.4s)]
*  I mean, this idea that somehow we've just whistled past the graveyard here and walked [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=238.4s)]
*  away from the challenge that Iran poses just isn't borne out by the facts. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=243.20000000000002s)]
*  These proxy groups have been attacking our troops and our facilities in Iraq and Syria [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=247.52s)]
*  well before this administration as well. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=251.74s)]
*  For instance, Mike Waltz said this morning that when you're trying to play defense constantly, [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=255.86s)]
*  rather than punching back in a meaningful way, this blood is on this administration's [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=260.22s)]
*  hands. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=264.06s)]
*  What is the response from the White House to an accusation like that? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=265.86s)]
*  What I would tell you and I would tell the congressman is we're mindful of what Iran's [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=270.46000000000004s)]
*  doing in the region. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=274.62s)]
*  And we have taken aggressive action against these proxy groups and about and on their [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=275.96000000000004s)]
*  influence in the region. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=281.14s)]
*  And there are decisions yet to come. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=282.78000000000003s)]
*  So let the president make his decisions. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=284.86s)]
*  Let him weigh these options and then we'll act. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=287.98s)]
*  These groups have choices to make. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=291.06s)]
*  And we're going to do everything we can to make sure that they make the right choice [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=293.4s)]
*  here. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=297.1s)]
*  But the idea that we have somehow laid down and not pushed back on Iran is simply not [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=298.1s)]
*  borne out by the facts. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  John, in Israel over the weekend, some ministers from the Netanyahu government... [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=304.34000000000003s)]
*  So John, you have to ask yourself, what was the original messaging from this White House [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=309.46000000000004s)]
*  and the administration and Joe Biden with don't? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=313.38s)]
*  Was it don't kill any Americans? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=316.82s)]
*  Was it don't attack our U.S. bases? [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  Was it don't show any escalation here? [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=321.62s)]
*  Because now he's saying the difference with now the more than 160 attacks here is that [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=324.68s)]
*  with this case, people died. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=330.06s)]
*  But was that the red line? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=332.98s)]
*  Because they never said that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=334.3s)]
*  Well, I mean, the effective impact of it was what he kept saying, don't, don't, don't, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=335.82s)]
*  was he was telling Iran, don't listen to a thing I say, which they didn't. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=339.62s)]
*  And they kept on attacking us. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=343.3s)]
*  And now we see the result of that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=345.14s)]
*  Jason, Japheth's still with us. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=347.62s)]
*  Jason, if the White House chooses to hit back against these Iranian proxies, whether it [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=349.82s)]
*  be Hezbollah, whether it be Hamas, whether it be the Houthi rebels, I mean, those groups [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=355.7s)]
*  are just cannon fodder for the Iranian regime. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=362.21999999999997s)]
*  And unless the president hits back against Iran proper, is anything going to change? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=366.02s)]
*  No, no. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=371.82s)]
*  I heard Admiral Kirby very clearly say we are not going to telegraph what we're going [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=372.82s)]
*  to do. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=379.02s)]
*  Maybe it's time to telegraph what we're going to do. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=380.02s)]
*  You attack America, you fire shots at America, you come after Americans. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=382.46s)]
*  I will kill you. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=386.3s)]
*  Your life will be over. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=388.62s)]
*  Think about the men and women who are in the theater of war. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=390.7s)]
*  If your son or daughter is out there serving, and this president won't say boo other than [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00XZ_re_ndw&t=394.1s)]
