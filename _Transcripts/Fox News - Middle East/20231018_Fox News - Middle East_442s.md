# Marsha Blackburn: This is not enough from Joe Biden
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA)
*  The Gaza hospital blast sparking new warnings from Iran, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=0.0s)]
*  its foreign minister posting on social media [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=3.64s)]
*  that the time is over for Israel. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=5.68s)]
*  Hours earlier, top Iranian commander threatened [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=8.72s)]
*  that Israel will face another shockwave of attacks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=11.18s)]
*  All of this is there are multiple reports tying Iran [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=14.82s)]
*  to the initial Hamas terror spree. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=17.82s)]
*  Sheikh Atty. who was granted asylum from Iran, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=20.1s)]
*  writing it in op-ed, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=22.42s)]
*  Hamas and Islamic Jihad have their own political objectives [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=23.8s)]
*  for this attack, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=27.34s)]
*  Iran is likely to be the largest beneficiary. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=28.46s)]
*  The regime expects Israel's national security policy [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=31.3s)]
*  to reorient toward the Palestinians, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=34.660000000000004s)]
*  relieving Tehran of military pressure in Syria and Iraq. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=37.260000000000005s)]
*  Iran thinks it will be free to advance its nuclear program [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=41.24s)]
*  while Israel tries to deal with Hamas. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  Senate Republicans yesterday called for the United States [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=47.980000000000004s)]
*  to immediately end aid to the Palestinians in Gaza. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=50.42s)]
*  They also urge President Biden to formally freeze [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=53.980000000000004s)]
*  the $6 billion that we released to Iran [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=57.38s)]
*  in a prisoner swap last month. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=60.2s)]
*  We know that Iran bankrolls Hamas. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=63.34s)]
*  We need to ensure that not another dollar goes to Iran. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=66.68s)]
*  Unfortunately, the message of the Biden administration [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=71.78s)]
*  has been one of appeasement of Iran. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=74.12s)]
*  Biden's ransom payment made the Iranians [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=77.02000000000001s)]
*  shows you where his true colors are. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=81.06s)]
*  We need our leaders to stand firm [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=83.34s)]
*  and calling them accountable. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=86.92s)]
*  We as a nation will stand up to the world's largest [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=88.86s)]
*  state sponsor of terror, and that is Iran. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=93.26s)]
*  Senator Marshall Blackburn serves on the Senate Finance, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=98.4s)]
*  Judiciary and Veterans Affairs committees, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=101.04s)]
*  and she joins us now. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=102.88000000000001s)]
*  So the Treasury Department Senator has said [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=104.38000000000001s)]
*  that it is going to block Iranian access to that $6 billion, [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=106.42s)]
*  but you and your Senate colleagues believe [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=110.34s)]
*  that the government needs to go further than that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=112.78s)]
*  and completely refreeze that money. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=115.2s)]
*  Why? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=117.0s)]
*  Absolutely, the money should be refrozen, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=118.14s)]
*  and the waivers that allowed the transfer to take place [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=121.10000000000001s)]
*  from South Korean banks to Qatar banks need to be rescinded. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=124.28s)]
*  We do not want Iran to ever have their hands on that money. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  John, what we do know is when you give Iran money, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=133.98000000000002s)]
*  like happened with the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=140.26000000000002s)]
*  and again with this $6 billion in ransom payments, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=143.92000000000002s)]
*  what does Iran do with this money? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=149.96s)]
*  A couple of things. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=151.70000000000002s)]
*  They will enrich uranium [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=153.26s)]
*  so that they can build nuclear warheads. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=155.5s)]
*  We do not want them to have nuclear warheads. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=157.96s)]
*  And secondly, Iran is the world's largest [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=162.24s)]
*  state sponsor of terrorism. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  If you give them a dollar, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=168.44s)]
*  they're going to put most of that dollar into terrorism. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=170.04000000000002s)]
*  They fund Hamas to the tune of $100 million a year, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=174.18s)]
*  plus supplies and training and weapons and ammo, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=179.08s)]
*  and Hezbollah, the exact same program. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=183.38s)]
*  See, Iran uses these proxies to do their dirty work [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=186.56s)]
*  and to carry out these terrorist attacks [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=192.60000000000002s)]
*  like Hamas has carried out on Israel. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=194.9s)]
*  Senator, we saw what an Iranian-backed proxy can do [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=199.01999999999998s)]
*  with motorcycles, paragliders, and stolen cars. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=202.12s)]
*  What could Iran do to Israel [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=205.7s)]
*  if it ever got its hands on a nuclear weapon? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=208.23999999999998s)]
*  And this is of concern for us because what has Iran [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=211.5s)]
*  and what has the Ayatollah said is their goal. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=214.7s)]
*  It is to eliminate Israel. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=218.57999999999998s)]
*  And they have even called this attack on Israel by Hamas [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=221.18s)]
*  as a necessary step in eliminating Israel. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=226.24s)]
*  You have these radicals, these terrorists [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=230.76000000000002s)]
*  that run around shouting, death to Israel, death to America. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=233.94s)]
*  They go through Israel saying, from the river to the sea, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=238.74s)]
*  which means eliminating Israel. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=243.28s)]
*  So we know what they're going to do. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=246.72s)]
*  They have told us what they're going to do, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=249.06s)]
*  and if they're going to tell you what they're going to do, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  for goodness sakes, believe them and let's agree to stop them [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=254.74s)]
*  and to eliminate these terrorist organizations [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=260.98s)]
*  from the face of the earth. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=264.42s)]
*  So Senator, Iran has said in recent hours [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=267.1s)]
*  that if Israel continues its military campaign in Gaza, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=271.12s)]
*  it will face another shockwave, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=274.46s)]
*  that threat coming directly from Iran. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=276.7s)]
*  Yet we heard the president again today in Tel Aviv [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=278.94s)]
*  when he was saying to other actors in the region [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=282.4s)]
*  to stay out of this, he just used the words, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=285.94s)]
*  don't, don't, don't, one fewer don'ts [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=288.24s)]
*  than he iterated on Sunday night. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=291.54s)]
*  Does he need to be sending a stronger signal to Iran? [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=294.04s)]
*  If Iran is threatening Israel directly, [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=297.42s)]
*  does the United States president not need to step it up a bit [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=300.08s)]
*  in terms of the rhetoric? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=303.06s)]
*  Yes, he does. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=304.48s)]
*  And that's why I'm formally freezing the $6 billion, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=305.8s)]
*  re-implementing the sanctions, which as you know, John, [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=309.21999999999997s)]
*  Iran during the Trump administration [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=313.21999999999997s)]
*  was producing a few hundred barrels of oil a day. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  They're back to three million barrels a day [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=318.9s)]
*  and making a billion dollars a week on selling oil. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=321.3s)]
*  Put those sanctions in place. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=325.59999999999997s)]
*  Another thing, the UN Relief and Work Agency [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=327.3s)]
*  for Palestinian Refugees, which Trump had defunded, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=332.03999999999996s)]
*  Biden has put $730 million into it. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=336.5s)]
*  We have found that Hamas has Hamas affiliates [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=340.64000000000004s)]
*  working with that agency. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=344.6s)]
*  They have stolen some of the money. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=346.04s)]
*  They're using facilities to hide weaponry and ammo. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=347.74s)]
*  Defund it, defund it. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=352.28000000000003s)]
*  I've got a bill that would stop it [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  until Iran is removed from the United Nations. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=356.62s)]
*  They are the world's largest sponsor of terrorism. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=360.66s)]
*  And we have to make certain they do not have the resources [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=365.34s)]
*  to put into this terrorist activity. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=369.08s)]
*  Senator, if Iran were to give Hezbollah in Lebanon [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=373.28s)]
*  the green light to go ahead [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=376.18s)]
*  and launch a full-on attack against Israel, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=377.32s)]
*  which no doubt would put Tel Aviv [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=380.12s)]
*  and probably a large part of Jerusalem in the crosshairs, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  with two very powerful carrier battle groups [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=385.09999999999997s)]
*  in the 26th MEU off the shore, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=387.65999999999997s)]
*  what should the American president do? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=390.3s)]
*  This is something that is going to be a discussion [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=395.4s)]
*  with the Department of Defense [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=398.24s)]
*  and also with our allies that are there in the region. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=399.94s)]
*  It is a good thing that the carriers and the troops [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=404.09999999999997s)]
*  are stationed in that region. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=408.38s)]
*  It is important for them to protect Americans [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=410.62s)]
*  and to protect our American assets [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=413.92s)]
*  that are located in that region. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=417.36s)]
*  Senator Marsha Blackburn of the great state of Tennessee, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkyoZuCVFZA&t=421.5s)]
