# Trump: Soleimani's 'reign of terror' is over
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 03, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E)
*  President Trump is speaking now. Let's listen. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=0.0s)]
*  Executed a flawless precision strike that killed the number one terrorist anywhere in the world, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=5.4s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani. Soleimani was plotting imminent and sinister attacks on American diplomats [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=12.72s)]
*  and military personnel, but we caught him in the act and terminated him. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=21.28s)]
*  Under my leadership, America's policy is unambiguous to terrorists who harm or intend to harm any [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=28.12s)]
*  American. We will find you. We will eliminate you. We will always protect our diplomats, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=37.120000000000005s)]
*  service members, all Americans, and our allies. For years, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=43.92s)]
*  and its ruthless Quds Force under Soleimani's leadership has targeted, injured, and murdered [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=52.72s)]
*  hundreds of American civilians and servicemen. The recent attacks on U.S. targets in Iraq, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=59.6s)]
*  including rocket strikes that killed an American and injured four American servicemen very badly, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=66.56s)]
*  as well as a violent assault on our embassy in Baghdad, were carried out at the direction of [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=72.08s)]
*  Soleimani. Soleimani made the death of innocent people his sick passion, contributing to terrorist [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=79.52s)]
*  plots as far away as New Delhi and London. Today, we remember and honor the victims of Soleimani's [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=88.56s)]
*  many atrocities, and we take comfort in knowing that his reign of terror is over. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=96.08s)]
*  We're going to pause for one moment to let our Fox stations join us. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=102.4s)]
*  Perpetrating acts of terror to destabilize the Middle East for the last 20 years. What the United [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=106.08s)]
*  States did yesterday should have been done long ago. A lot of lives would have been saved. Just [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=112.8s)]
*  recently, Soleimani led the brutal repression of protesters in Iran, where more than a thousand [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=118.64s)]
*  innocent civilians were tortured and killed by their own government. We took action last night [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=126.8s)]
*  to stop a war. We did not take action to start a war. I have deep respect for the Iranian people. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=133.68s)]
*  They are a remarkable people with an incredible heritage and unlimited potential. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=144.96s)]
*  We do not seek regime change. However, the Iranian regime's aggression in the region, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=151.12s)]
*  including the use of proxy fighters to destabilize its neighbors, must end and it must end now. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=156.0s)]
*  The future belongs to the people of Iran, those who seek peaceful coexistence and cooperation, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=164.56s)]
*  not the terrorist warlords who plunder their nation to finance bloodshed abroad. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=171.6s)]
*  The United States has the best military by far anywhere in the world. We have the best [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=179.36s)]
*  intelligence in the world. If Americans anywhere are threatened, we have all of those targets [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=185.84s)]
*  already fully identified, and I am ready and prepared to take whatever action is necessary. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=192.88000000000002s)]
*  And that in particular refers to Iran. Under my leadership, we have destroyed the ISIS [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=202.24s)]
*  territorial caliphate, and recently American Special Operations Forces killed the terrorist [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=209.60000000000002s)]
*  leader known as Al Baghdadi. The world is a safer place without these monsters. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=215.68s)]
*  America will always pursue the interests of good people, great people, great souls, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=224.24s)]
*  while seeking peace, harmony, and friendship with all of the nations of the world. Thank you. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=230.88s)]
*  God bless you. God bless our great military, and God bless the United States of America. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  Thank you very much. Thank you. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PpOq5Xe4T3E&t=243.68s)]
