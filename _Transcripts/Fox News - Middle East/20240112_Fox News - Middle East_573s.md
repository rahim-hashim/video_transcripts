# Kayleigh McEnany: This is pathetic, sad and GROSS.
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU)
*  Yemen's Houthi rebels are now warning of fierce retaliation for the overnight American and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=0.0s)]
*  British strikes, further raising the prospect of a wider conflict. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=6.44s)]
*  In a region, the U.S. and U.K. launched dozens of strikes against Iranian-backed Houthis [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=10.44s)]
*  in Yemen. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=15.280000000000001s)]
*  The proxy group has ambushed more than two dozen shipping vessels in the past six weeks [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=16.28s)]
*  as part of Tehran's response to Israel's war on Hamas and Gaza. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=20.92s)]
*  Over 60 Houthi targets were attacked by precision strikes from U.S. and U.K. warplanes, warships [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=25.26s)]
*  and submarines. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=31.020000000000003s)]
*  Only a handful of rebel fighters were reportedly killed in those strikes. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=32.58s)]
*  The Houthi's military spokesman says the attacks will not go unanswered or unpunished. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=36.06s)]
*  Secretary, please break this down for us. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=41.620000000000005s)]
*  What does all of this mean? [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=45.06s)]
*  Well, first of all, it's still the battle between Shia and Sunni. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=46.06s)]
*  So Iran, Shia country back into the Houthi rebels who are fighting Yemen, who's a Sunni-backed [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=49.38s)]
*  government and so they're fighting a civil war in Yemen and they're trying to hit us [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=56.580000000000005s)]
*  obviously here. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=60.38s)]
*  This is what I would say to the Houthi rebels. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=61.82s)]
*  You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=65.38s)]
*  We've told you for months now, knock it off, knock it off. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=69.42s)]
*  In fact, the U.S. Navy helicopters took out three Houthi ships at the end of December, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=71.86s)]
*  so they kept going, they kept going as you mentioned. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=76.94s)]
*  Over two dozen attacks in the last 30 days, about an attack every other day. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=78.78s)]
*  So last night was massive. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=82.86s)]
*  It was U.S., U.K., Australia, Netherlands, even Iran got involved in 60 different locations. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=84.25999999999999s)]
*  This is sending a message that yes, we are not going to get bogged down again in the [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=93.78s)]
*  Middle East, but we're going to not let you try and stop the shipping lanes where 15% [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=97.46s)]
*  trade goes through and that's shipping lanes. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=103.78s)]
*  And it's cost the American companies, American taxpayers and others to make sure that we [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=106.1s)]
*  can still have free trade, et cetera, because when you look at say energy policy, about [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=110.58s)]
*  there's three energy superpowers in the world, the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Russia. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=116.58s)]
*  And a lot of energy throughout the world that goes through that area, through the Red Sea, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=122.86s)]
*  et cetera, and we need to make sure that the Houthis are hitting commercial ships and hitting [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=126.69999999999999s)]
*  innocent civilians. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=130.82s)]
*  We can't look the other way. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=132.5s)]
*  We let them know and now we really let them know last night. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=133.5s)]
*  Morgan, can you explain for us for those that appreciate the secretary's point and ask further, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=136.5s)]
*  but what about Iran? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=141.98s)]
*  What about the fact that the Biden administration has maintained, including last night, Iran [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=143.42s)]
*  is the primary enabler, the primary antagonist. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=147.1s)]
*  And yet we've been able to report they've been enriched by billions over oil through [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=150.45999999999998s)]
*  the Biden administration. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=154.62s)]
*  They've spent billions. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=155.66s)]
*  They have they've ramped up their new programs. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=157.66s)]
*  There's been so much benefit to the Iranians. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=160.9s)]
*  Why or when will those consequences occur? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=162.98s)]
*  So first of all, let me say I agree with everything Patrick just said. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=166.54s)]
*  It was a strong response last night. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=169.26s)]
*  However, nothing happens in a vacuum. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=171.57999999999998s)]
*  And there's actually policy decisions that got us to where we are today. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=173.7s)]
*  And those policy decisions started in the early days of the Biden administration. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=177.4s)]
*  So on January 11th, 2021, exactly three years ago, after about a year of putting together [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=181.4s)]
*  the package, the Trump administration under Mike Pompeo, under our state department, in [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=187.85999999999999s)]
*  which I serve, we designated the Houthis as a terrorist organization. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=191.66s)]
*  Three years later, January 11th, 2024, the Biden administration had to pursue the strikes [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=195.7s)]
*  yesterday. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=200.5s)]
*  What happened in those three years? [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=201.5s)]
*  Well, in the first few weeks of the Biden administration, they removed that terrorism [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=203.38s)]
*  designation from the Houthis. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=207.38s)]
*  I've talked about this a lot. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=208.94s)]
*  That matters because literally two days after they removed that designation, the Houthis [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=210.62s)]
*  started their attacks. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=215.66s)]
*  So they removed that designation without getting anything for it. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=217.66s)]
*  No negotiation. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=219.84s)]
*  The Houthis didn't have a come to Jesus moment and say we're going to stop terrorism. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=221.08s)]
*  They clearly continued it. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=224.32000000000002s)]
*  Second, in February of 2021, Biden gave a speech in which he said, we're no longer going [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=225.8s)]
*  to send these defensive weapons to Saudi Arabia. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=229.78s)]
*  We have to stop the war in Yemen. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=233.36s)]
*  And there was a lot of civilian casualties. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=235.46s)]
*  That war was not without controversy. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=237.20000000000002s)]
*  But Saudi was going after the Houthis and was trying to decrease their capabilities [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=239.04000000000002s)]
*  to commit terrorist attacks, which were happening against civilian infrastructure in Saudi. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=244.56s)]
*  Biden said three years ago, no mass. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=248.76s)]
*  So what's happened over the past three years? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=250.84s)]
*  They stopped Saudi Arabia from going after the Houthis. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=252.76s)]
*  They took away their terrorism designation. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=255.48s)]
*  And the Houthis have had three years of being able to equip and train themselves. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=258.0s)]
*  And of course, they've done that, as you just said, through Iran, who gave, who has had [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=264.0s)]
*  about $90 billion that they have earned from oil revenue from sanctions that have not been [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=267.68s)]
*  enforced. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=272.44s)]
*  $90 billion, not only to give to Hamas, Hezbollah and to the Houthis. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=273.44s)]
*  Right now we have the nightmare scenario that we said we never wanted after 9-11. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=278.08s)]
*  Dagan, you and I are old enough to remember after 9-11, what did we always say? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=281.8s)]
*  We always worried about sophisticated weaponry getting in the hands of terrorist group. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=285.8s)]
*  We now have in the hands of terrorist group ballistic missiles going after our U.S. ships, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=290.65999999999997s)]
*  going after our Navy sailors, going after a civilian infrastructure. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=297.0s)]
*  You're talking about sophisticated drones. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=301.64s)]
*  You're not talking about IEDs or stuff that we saw in the early days of Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=303.58s)]
*  You're talking about ballistic missiles that the terrorist group has. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=307.56s)]
*  And it has it because Iran has been enabled and allowed to give these weapons to the Houthis. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=310.84000000000003s)]
*  So three years of disastrous Iran policy led to Hamas on October 7th. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=317.64s)]
*  It led to the Houthi attacks, which is stopping shipping and commerce and which is going directly [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=322.92s)]
*  after our American sailors and our American ships. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=328.02s)]
*  So thank you for the attack last night. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=331.26s)]
*  It's about a day late and a dollar short. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=333.18s)]
*  Can I just make a quick point? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=334.82s)]
*  Because I agree, Morgan, I agree with you that the Houthi rebels, they're a terrorist organization. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=335.82s)]
*  So I absolutely agree with that. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=338.97999999999996s)]
*  I think it's longer than three years though. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=339.97999999999996s)]
*  The major counterbalance to Iran actually was Iraq because Iran, Iraq was Sunni-led [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=341.96s)]
*  under Saddam Hussein and when we took out Saddam Hussein, that was the counterbalance [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=348.74s)]
*  to Iran. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=351.97999999999996s)]
*  So they've been getting stronger year after year for the last couple decades since we [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=352.97999999999996s)]
*  overtook them. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=356.46s)]
*  I'm not saying Saddam was a bad person, so I'm not arguing that. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=357.9s)]
*  But there was this natural counterbalance. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=360.5s)]
*  But I do think that people are waking up to the region that there's still the Sunni versus [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=362.78s)]
*  Shia and that's why Saudi Arabia is a Sunni. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=365.94s)]
*  But it's not just Sunni and Shia because Hamas is not Shia. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=368.65999999999997s)]
*  Iran has the desire to remove the United States out of the Middle East and direct havoc on [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=372.02s)]
*  the Middle East. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=376.38s)]
*  We unveiled in the final days of the Trump administration that al-Qaeda senior leadership [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=377.41999999999996s)]
*  who are Sunni were being given safe haven in Iran. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=380.74s)]
*  So it is Sunni and Shia in many places, but it's not just that. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=384.2s)]
*  Iran doesn't care if their funding is Sunni terrorist organization. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=388.0s)]
*  If it will wreak havoc in the Middle East, will destroy Israel and will ultimately kick [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=390.56s)]
*  the United States out. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=393.96s)]
*  That's their goal. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=395.2s)]
*  They don't want us in the region at all. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=396.2s)]
*  Kayleigh, former White House press secretary, Kirby was pressed exactly on the point of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=398.2s)]
*  the deed listing, which he said, essentially I'm paraphrasing, well we're going to take [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=402.59999999999997s)]
*  a look. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=406.36s)]
*  We're going to take a look at reconsidering and then look at what happens. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=408.32s)]
*  Oh, take a look. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=411.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=412.44s)]
*  January 15th, 2021, Trump Pompeo lists the Houthis as a terrorist organization. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=413.6s)]
*  February 4th, Biden unlisted them. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=418.92s)]
*  It is pathetic, sad, and really quite gross when Moskowitz, a Democrat on the Hill, has [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=421.32s)]
*  to pin a bipartisan letter to the State Department to relist them when Democratic congressmen [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=428.58s)]
*  are having to tell a Democratic commander in chief to step it up. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=434.04s)]
*  I laughed out loud when I read this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=437.84s)]
*  In terms of consequences on Iran, this is from a senior administration official, we [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=440.24s)]
*  have a long-standing and deep pressure campaign. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=444.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay, let's talk about that deep pressure campaign. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=447.04s)]
*  Long-standing pressure campaign from the Biden administration. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=449.76s)]
*  It entailed unfreezing $6 billion to Iran. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=452.48s)]
*  It entailed oil increasing, according to John Radcliffe, production by 650%. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=456.34000000000003s)]
*  It included delisting the Houthis. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=461.72s)]
*  That is the long-standing pressure campaign of the Biden administration. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=464.04s)]
*  You want to get tough. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  You want to get serious. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=468.06s)]
*  Dispense the Houthis. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=469.6s)]
*  Call for the Palestinian leader to be extradited. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=470.6s)]
*  That's what we call a pressure campaign. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=474.12s)]
*  Take out Soleimani. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=475.72s)]
*  That's what Trump did. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=476.88s)]
*  Degan. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=477.88s)]
*  Here's a headline. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=478.88s)]
*  Iran reducing oil exports to China, not because of anything the United States has done, it's [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=479.88s)]
*  because it's demanding such a high price from China. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=486.0s)]
*  Oil exports to China out of Iran hit a record in October. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=489.32000000000005s)]
*  In nine months ending in December, Iran made at least $26.5 billion because the United [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=495.04s)]
*  States run by Biden is doing jack nothing to stop those exports. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=502.0s)]
*  Oh, and Saudi Arabia? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=506.92s)]
*  Saudi Arabia just joined the bloc of BRICS countries, Brazil, Russia, India, China and [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=509.0s)]
*  South Africa while we're negotiating a defense treaty with Saudi Arabia. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=516.6s)]
*  And Iran also joined the BRICS nations. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=523.16s)]
*  It was supposed to just have kind of economic influence, but it has grave geopolitical influence [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=526.08s)]
*  as well. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=533.64s)]
*  Why is Saudi Arabia teaming up with nations that hate the United States? [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=534.64s)]
*  Because it can. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=539.0s)]
*  Well, Degan, I was actually in Saudi on Sunday and I met with the Crown Prince and we asked [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=540.0s)]
*  him that same question. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=544.8000000000001s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=545.8000000000001s)]
*  My understanding is that there is a way out for it and I hope that the Biden administration [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=546.8000000000001s)]
*  is pressuring them on that, that they're not fully committed to BRICS yet. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=550.56s)]
*  So, but you're dead right. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=553.4s)]
*  They announced on state TV that they're in it. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AVUkpr5TIpU&t=554.68s)]
