# Trump is the only president who did anything for Jews: David Mamet
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 24, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w)
*  On behalf of Hamas inciting a sharp rise in anti-Semitic attacks around the world really. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=0.0s)]
*  And then yesterday, a question and then an answer with this reaction from the White House [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  seemingly dismissing a lot of those concerns. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=12.24s)]
*  What is his level of concern right now about the potential rise of anti-Semitism? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=15.08s)]
*  We have not seen any credible threats. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=22.12s)]
*  Muslim and those perceived to be Muslim have endured a disproportionate number of hate-fueled [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=26.18s)]
*  attacks. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=31.66s)]
*  President Biden understands that many of our Muslim, Arab, Arab Americans and Palestinian [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=32.66s)]
*  American loved ones and neighbors are worried about the hate being directed at their communities. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=37.06s)]
*  I mean, that got some attention. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=41.94s)]
*  David Mametz, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, he joins me now. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=43.78s)]
*  David, thank you for your time. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=47.18s)]
*  Good morning to you. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=48.86s)]
*  You're so prolific with the words. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=49.86s)]
*  I think I know how you would interpret the words we just heard there. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=54.38s)]
*  Jared Moskovitz is a Democratic congressman, Jewish, from Florida. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=57.900000000000006s)]
*  He said this, he said, what a weak answer. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=63.38s)]
*  And why are you looking in the book? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=65.74000000000001s)]
*  What's the approved answer? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=67.78s)]
*  The simple answer is yes, you are concerned about the rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=69.78s)]
*  Of course, we're also worried about hatred against Muslim Americans. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=74.54s)]
*  Must do better. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=78.38s)]
*  Well, I mean, that spread like a prairie fire. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=79.38s)]
*  And after that press conference yesterday, Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted to be clear the [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=82.42s)]
*  president and our team are very concerned about a rise in anti-Semitism, especially [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=86.66s)]
*  after the horrific Hamas terrorist attack in Israel. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=91.46s)]
*  Can you walk us through this and help understand why the question was so clear, but the answers [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=94.94s)]
*  seem to be buried in a book on a podium? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=101.89999999999999s)]
*  Sure. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=105.78s)]
*  The problem is it goes back a couple of years. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=108.41999999999999s)]
*  It goes back to the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem in 77 CE. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=111.7s)]
*  What happened since then was that my people, the Jews, have been dispersed throughout the [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=117.74000000000001s)]
*  world and were slaves living at the pleasure of their owners for 2,000 years, up until [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=121.7s)]
*  the state of Israel. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=129.5s)]
*  So with the exception of the state of Israel, we have always been at the mercy of the countries [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=131.18s)]
*  which allowed us, some of them allowed us to live there, but they weren't free citizens. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=137.94s)]
*  So these countries, whether it was the Poles or whether it was the Russians or whether [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=142.98000000000002s)]
*  it was the Turks, could take whatever they wanted from us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=146.70000000000002s)]
*  So we Jews got in the habit of saying, please, please, can't you see there's such a thing [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=149.44s)]
*  as humanity? [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=154.86s)]
*  And the problem is that a lot of people see that there is such a thing as humanity, but [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=157.5s)]
*  a lot of those people, and a lot of them were in power in the White House, don't think the [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=162.3s)]
*  Jews are human beings. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=166.46s)]
*  You spent a lot of time in New York, and you've written a lot about how the Jewish experience [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=169.34s)]
*  in New York is so unique. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=174.38s)]
*  And you penned this piece yesterday, it's a stunning piece of writing. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=176.58s)]
*  Your title is How the Democrats Betrayed the Jews. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=181.86s)]
*  The Sick Thrill of Anti-Semitism Has a Price. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=185.3s)]
*  What do you mean by that last part there? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=189.62s)]
*  What price, David? [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=192.58s)]
*  Well, the price is thatâ€”you know, I'm a conservative, and I used to have a lot of [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=195.02s)]
*  liberal friends, but I don't know where they are. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=200.62s)]
*  Maybe they lost my number. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=203.10000000000002s)]
*  But I have a lot of conservative friends who are not Jewish, and at certain points, they [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=204.62s)]
*  all get this look on their face, and I know what's going to come next. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  And the question is, Dave, I thought Jews were smart. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=213.5s)]
*  Why did they vote for the liberals? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  And the answer is that we Jews aren't smart. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=219.14000000000001s)]
*  We're actually stupid. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=222.06s)]
*  We're great at self-reliance because we never had anyone to rely on. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=223.38s)]
*  But when it comes to getting into a group, with the exception of the state of Israel, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=226.86s)]
*  we say, I don't want to be identified. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=231.18s)]
*  Leave me alone. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=234.46s)]
*  So what we need to do in this country, my fellow Jews, is get together and stop going [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=235.78s)]
*  to meetings and talking about how bad it is. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=241.58s)]
*  And what I suggested in that article is Thanksgiving's coming up. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=244.06s)]
*  When your kids come home from college, don't send them back. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=247.78s)]
*  Stop funding anti-Semitic hatred and calling it, oh, it's a good place to meet people. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=251.86s)]
*  Because for a Jew to send his or her son or daughter to these elite institutions because [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=257.7s)]
*  they're going to make connections is the same thing as putting their daughter in a brothel [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=262.82s)]
*  because they're going to meet powerful men there. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=267.46000000000004s)]
*  It doesn't make sense. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=271.7s)]
*  And we're going to have to assert ourselves rather than pretending we're talking to Franklin [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=273.54s)]
*  who sent Jews back to die in the gas chambers and wouldn't interdict the Holocaust. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=279.22s)]
*  He's dead. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=284.38000000000005s)]
*  He did nothing for the Jews. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=285.38000000000005s)]
*  The liberals have never done anything for the Jews. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=286.62s)]
*  The only person who ever did anything for the Jews was Trump. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=289.86s)]
*  And he brought peace to the Middle East. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=293.70000000000005s)]
*  And liberal Jews are saying, oh, I don't like this Trump. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=295.62s)]
*  It's time to stop putting our head in the sand. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=298.38000000000005s)]
*  And it's time to stop people pussing on our back and telling us it's raining. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=301.62s)]
*  I want to finish the line. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=306.73999999999995s)]
*  The sick thrill of anti-Semitism also has a price. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=308.02s)]
*  The surrender of reason and with it of conscience. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=311.29999999999995s)]
*  David, thank you for your time. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=314.53999999999996s)]
*  Really enjoy speaking with you. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=317.09999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=318.09999999999997s)]
*  You're very welcome. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G1zIUheek7w&t=319.09999999999997s)]
