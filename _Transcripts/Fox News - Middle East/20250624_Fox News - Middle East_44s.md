# Watters: They figuratively gave Trump the 'middle finger' #shorts #foxnews #news #us #iran #israel
**Fox News - Middle East:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM)
*  When I saw it happen on Saturday night, I thought it was a right strike. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump gave peace a chance, but the Ayatollah gave him the middle finger. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=3.84s)]
*  Figuratively, he wanted to meet him in Turkey face to face for negotiations, and the Ayatollah [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  said no. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=14.6s)]
*  So, this was the last resort. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=15.6s)]
*  And it shows the effectiveness of this administration, the precision and the secrecy to be able to [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=19.16s)]
*  pull it off. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=24.88s)]
*  So, you know, the prestige of the U.S. military had taken a little bit of a beating after [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=25.88s)]
*  the Afghanistan withdrawal and all the trans stuff to come out and do something like this [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=31.84s)]
*  where they're putting a bomb on the target the size of an air conditioner. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k81I-H-YTVM&t=36.92s)]
