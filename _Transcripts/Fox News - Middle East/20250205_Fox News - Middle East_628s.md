# Netanyahu: We will continue to achieve victory over our enemies
**Fox News - Middle East:** [February 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc)
*  And joining us now Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is with us. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=0.0s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, great to have you back sir. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=4.0s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=7.0s)]
*  First, once again, my condolences. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=9.0s)]
*  After all your country has been through the equivalent of 40,000 dead Americans a day in a single day. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=13.0s)]
*  And murder and rape and kidnapping and torture and beheading and now, you know, four, five, six, seven front wars. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=20.0s)]
*  It's been rough for Israel. How's the country holding up? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=28.0s)]
*  Well, it's holding up remarkably because of the spirit of our people and the indomitable courage of our soldiers. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=34.0s)]
*  And the resolution of our government to roll back this tide of terror, this murderous mass, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=40.0s)]
*  that hit Hamas and hit the Iran axis that sponsors Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and is committed to destroy Israel. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=50.0s)]
*  They thought we were just going to fold. And a year and some later, they're folding. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=58.0s)]
*  And we're going to continue until we achieve victory over our enemies that are your enemies. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=64.0s)]
*  Because these people chant, death to America, death to Israel. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=69.0s)]
*  You're the great Satan, we're the small Satan, but we're standing in their way. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=72.0s)]
*  Well, we're defeating them and our victory is your victory. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=76.0s)]
*  You stood with America after 9-11 on this program, on with me many, many times. I'll never forget it. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=80.0s)]
*  Yesterday was historic and you actually used the phrase that Donald Trump is the greatest friend Israel's ever had in the White House. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=89.0s)]
*  Explain. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=97.0s)]
*  It's that simple. He's the greatest friend Israel ever had in the White House. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=101.0s)]
*  In his first term, he recognized Jerusalem as our capital and moved the American embassy there, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=105.0s)]
*  recognized our sovereignty over the Golan Heights, got out of the disastrous Iran deal, brokered, and we worked together on this, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=111.0s)]
*  the historic Abraham Accords that brought peace to Israel and four Arab states. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=121.0s)]
*  You want more? I mean, that's a lot. And look what he's done in the last few days. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=127.0s)]
*  I mean, he's done remarkable things. He's released the ammunition that we need to continue our march to victory. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=131.0s)]
*  He's taken action against UNRWA and these other UN agencies that hate America and hate Israel. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=139.0s)]
*  He's done enormous things. And yes, he's the greatest friend that Israel's ever had in the White House. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=146.0s)]
*  You said that you believe peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia is not only feasible, you think it's going to happen. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=153.0s)]
*  And President Trump, I'll juxtapose that with what he said about Gaza and how Gaza has been basically turned into rubble. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=161.0s)]
*  And, you know, he talked about that America would go in, dismantle the dangerous unexploded bombs, level the site, rid the site of destroyed buildings, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=169.0s)]
*  and create an economic development that would simply supply unlimited jobs, housing for people in the area, and really make it a place worth living in. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=181.0s)]
*  Is that anything you expected? And do you share that belief? And what do you make of American media taking that? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=191.0s)]
*  He's taking over Gaza. He sounds like he's rebuilding Gaza to me. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=197.0s)]
*  Yeah, well, I don't think he talked about sending U.S. troops to complete the job of destroying Hamas. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=203.0s)]
*  That's our commitment. That's our job, and we're absolutely committed to it. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=209.0s)]
*  And I also don't think he said that he's going to fund it. He said that neighboring states, wealthy states, would do it. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=213.0s)]
*  But the actual idea of allowing first Gazans who want to leave to leave, I mean, what's wrong with that? [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=220.0s)]
*  They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back, but you have to rebuild Gaza. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=226.0s)]
*  If you want to rebuild Gaza, you can't haveâ€”this is the first good idea that I've heard. It's a remarkable idea. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=232.0s)]
*  And I think it should be really pursued, examined, pursued and done, because I think it will create a different future for everyone. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=239.0s)]
*  Two things the president said yesterday. One is that we have to ensure Hamas is eliminated and restore peace to that area. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=247.0s)]
*  And the second thing he said is Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=256.0s)]
*  You are the first leader of a state, you are the first prime minister, the first president to come visit the White House in his second term. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=261.0s)]
*  Between the reports that I read, even in the New York Times and elsewhere and my sources, we keep hearing that Iran is very close to nuclear capability. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=272.0s)]
*  I don't have the intelligence you have. I don't know what our country's intelligence has. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=283.0s)]
*  But all indications are they want a nuclear weapon. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=288.0s)]
*  Am I leaning into something that I shouldn't lean into? Was this sort of an emergency meeting about the state of Iran? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=293.0s)]
*  Well, there's no question Iran is gearing up to get nuclear weapons. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=305.0s)]
*  They probably would have been there 10 years ago already if we hadn't taken various actions to hold them up. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=309.0s)]
*  We held them up, we slowed them down, but we haven't stopped them completely. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=316.0s)]
*  So yes, they're seeking to do that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=321.0s)]
*  And of course we discussed this. And the president said something very simple, which I said as well. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=324.0s)]
*  Iran must not be allowed to have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=329.0s)]
*  You know, it's that simple. And it's just about all I can say about it. Iran should not have nuclear weapons. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=333.0s)]
*  Well, they can have nuclear weapons. I would think, you know, the president talking about other countries in the region, Egypt, Jordan, the Saudis, the Emirates, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=342.0s)]
*  I would think it's in their best interest to help resolve the issues in Gaza and Hamas and Lebanon and Hezbollah and Islamic Jihad and the Houthi rebels. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=351.0s)]
*  I think it's in everyone's best interest. But I think they all would unite against an Iran. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=362.0s)]
*  They would fight against Iranian hegemony and power with a nuclear weapon. I would think they all want that. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=368.0s)]
*  Well, I think it's a common knowledge that most of the Arab countries have shifted from seeing Israel as their great enemy to seeing Iran as their great enemy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=375.0s)]
*  They don't often say it. They often hide it. But they recognize that Israel is the one country in the Middle East that fought Iran. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=389.0s)]
*  We fight Iran. Iran openly declares its goal to destroy us. We didn't seek that conflict. They seek it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=396.0s)]
*  They openly say that they will wipe out the Jewish state. And they openly say that their goal is not merely the Jewish state, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=404.0s)]
*  but to conquer the Middle East and go beyond that and also blackmail the United States with nuclear weapons. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=411.0s)]
*  So in resisting this and taking action against this, we're not only doing it for our own survival, but again, for the interests of many countries in the region, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=417.0s)]
*  the U.S. interest as well, I think the interest of peace in the world. You don't want a world in which the Aitolos have nuclear weapons and the means to deliver them. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=427.0s)]
*  That's not going to produce peace. That's going to produce the most horrible of wars. It has to be stopped. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=436.0s)]
*  Do you believe, and you were pretty confident, that all the hostages that are alive will be returned? You are confident of that? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=443.0s)]
*  Well, it's first of all a goal that we set. We set three goals vis-Ã -vis Gaza. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=453.0s)]
*  One, destroy Hamas' military and governing capabilities. Two, release all the hostages. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=457.0s)]
*  And three, ensure that Gaza does not pose a threat to Israel anymore. And we're committed to achieving all three. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=463.0s)]
*  So far, we've decimated most of Hamas' military power, not all. There's some left. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=469.0s)]
*  And we'll make sure that it's not there when this war ends, and it could end very quickly. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=475.0s)]
*  Second, we've released so far about 70 percent, more than that actually, of the live hostages, which nobody believed we would do. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=480.0s)]
*  And we're committed to getting everyone out, both the living hostages and unfortunately also the dead hostages, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=490.0s)]
*  which Hamas also keeps, that cruel, that they're so monstrous, they actually keep bodies as hostages, too. It's just incredible. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=497.0s)]
*  So, yes, we intend to commit to do that. I won't talk here how we intend to do it, but it's something that is in my mind. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=505.0s)]
*  It's also in the president's mind. We don't leave it. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=514.0s)]
*  My last question to you, back to Donald Trump. When Donald Trump, before he got into office and he said, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=517.0s)]
*  All hell will break loose in the region if those hostages are not released. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=523.0s)]
*  How important were those words, in your view, to getting this deal done to get the hostages back? [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=530.0s)]
*  I think he used his influence, which is global. I think he used it with great effect to help us complete this release. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=536.0s)]
*  And I'm sure that working together will achieve great things. We intend to, we're changing the Middle East. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=547.0s)]
*  Israel has already done so in the last year. We've really changed the Middle East. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=553.0s)]
*  It was basically an Iranian pond that can do anything in it. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=558.0s)]
*  And we, in many ways, single-handedly, but with some American air defense support, which I appreciate, and some other help that I appreciate as well. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=561.0s)]
*  But Trump's entry into the White House gives enormous, enormous backing to those who wish to see Iran's aggression rolled back, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=570.0s)]
*  Iran never having a nuclear weapon, and that affects the entire region. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=583.0s)]
*  It elevates the spirit of Israelis. It elevates the spirit of all those who want to see a different Middle East, a prosperous and peaceful Middle East. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=588.0s)]
*  I think it changes the global equation. It definitely changes the equation in the Middle East. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=597.0s)]
*  I think you've got to take away their money. That would mean take out their refineries and take out their nucleosites. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=602.0s)]
*  And that will prevent a potential modern-day Holocaust, which we cannot ever have happen. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=608.0s)]
*  Mr. Prime Minister, we appreciate your time. Thank you, sir. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=615.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IRn1k4QTXc&t=627.0s)]
