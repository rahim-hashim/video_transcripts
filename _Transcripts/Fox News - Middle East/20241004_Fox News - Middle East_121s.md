# US strikes Houthi targets in Yemen
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc)
*  Breaking right now out of the Middle East, U.S. defense officials confirming the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=0.0s)]
*  has carried out strikes on several Houthi targets in Yemen. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=5.96s)]
*  Let's get right to Jennifer Griffin. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=9.6s)]
*  She's got the news live with the Pentagon for us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  What do we know, Jennifer? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=12.88s)]
*  Well, Sandra, we have new details about these airstrikes. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=13.88s)]
*  These are unusual airstrikes because the U.S. has not been striking at Houthi targets in [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Yemen for several months. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=21.64s)]
*  And you'll remember that just a week ago, three U.S. warships came under attack by over [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=23.5s)]
*  a dozen ballistic and cruise missiles and drones fired by the Houthis. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=28.32s)]
*  And there had been no response until now of that attack last Friday. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=32.4s)]
*  We're told that these strikes, these airstrikes in Yemen targeting Houthi weapon storage facilities [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=37.480000000000004s)]
*  and other areas, including the airport, there were seven strikes at the airport in Hodeida, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=43.6s)]
*  which has been used as a transit point for weapons. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=48.64s)]
*  We understand that this is not in retaliation for last week's attacks on those U.S. warships. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=52.52s)]
*  The U.S. Navy warships managed to shoot down those dozen or so ballistic and cruise missiles [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=58.6s)]
*  last week. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=63.46s)]
*  But what we have just learned is that these airstrikes carried out by the U.S. military [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=65.16s)]
*  from the air and from the sea concluded just a few moments ago. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=70.44s)]
*  This also comes, remember, on Monday, Sandra, that the Houthis shot down an MQ-9 Reaper [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=74.86s)]
*  drone, a U.S. drone that was flying over Yemen. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=80.56s)]
*  That is the eighth drone that has been shot down by the Houthis in the last year. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=84.2s)]
*  Those drones are worth $32 million. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=88.56s)]
*  So that's a big loss for the U.S. military. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=91.16s)]
*  But what we can say right now is that U.S. airstrikes from warplanes as well as from [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=93.75999999999999s)]
*  the sea just struck about a dozen sites inside Yemen targeting Houthi strongholds. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=99.47999999999999s)]
*  Sandra? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=105.67999999999999s)]
*  All right, Jennifer Griffin, with that update live at the Pentagon Forest. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=106.67999999999999s)]
*  Jennifer, thank you. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=109.52s)]
*  I'm Steve Ducey. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fBw2hUpaBUc&t=110.52s)]
