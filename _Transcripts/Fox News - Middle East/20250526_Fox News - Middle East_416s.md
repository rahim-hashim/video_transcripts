# Noem makes big promise on Iranâ€™s nuclear weapon capability
**Fox News - Middle East:** [May 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts)
*  So this morning DHS Secretary Kristi Noem is in Israel honoring the two Israeli embassy staffers [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=0.0s)]
*  fatally shot by an in suspect screaming free Palestine days before they were set to get engaged. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=6.0s)]
*  DHS Secretary Kristi Noem just met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=12.0s)]
*  She joins us now from Tel Aviv. So great to see you this morning, Madam Secretary. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=16.0s)]
*  So tell us about your meeting with with Bibi Netanyahu. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=21.0s)]
*  Well I landed here in Israel late last night, went immediately to the Western Wall. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=28.0s)]
*  As you know, this is a time of celebration in Israel. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=32.0s)]
*  And also then after that around 10 o'clock last night went and met with Bibi, with the Prime Minister [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=35.0s)]
*  and had a conversation about President Trump's negotiations with Iran and had a conversation with him. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=41.0s)]
*  President Trump specifically sent me here to have a conversation with the Prime Minister [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=47.0s)]
*  about how those negotiations are going and how important it is that we stay united [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=51.0s)]
*  and let this process play out. It was a very candid conversation. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=57.0s)]
*  I've known the Prime Minister for many years and had many good conversations with him. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=61.0s)]
*  But this was one directly from the President and I think the Prime Minister greatly appreciated it. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=66.0s)]
*  We spent today also out on the Gaza border talking with some of the IDF soldiers [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=72.0s)]
*  and visiting with them with our great ambassador that we have here, Ambassador Huckabee. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=77.0s)]
*  And since it's Memorial Day, we also spent some time with our Coast Guard troops. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=82.0s)]
*  We have many Coast Guard folks in the region that we've been able to visit and talk to them and thank them for their service. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=87.0s)]
*  When you say that you had a candid conversation, can you kind of lay out the outlines of what was candid? [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=93.0s)]
*  You know, I'm not going to share what the President's personal message was to the Prime Minister, [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=101.0s)]
*  but the Prime Minister's team had a conversation afterwards with us [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=105.0s)]
*  that they don't remember a bilateral meeting that was quite that candid and direct [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=109.0s)]
*  and about how we really felt about the importance of Israel, our support for Israel, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=115.0s)]
*  but that this negotiation was critically important too. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=121.0s)]
*  We're on a short timeframe here as well. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=125.0s)]
*  We aren't talking weeks and months and years before President Trump will make a decision on what's going to happen with Iran. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=127.0s)]
*  They've been given a very short timeframe, a matter of days, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=135.0s)]
*  and I asked the Prime Minister to work with President Trump to make sure that we were making wise decisions together. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=138.0s)]
*  Listen, Hamas is a dangerous enemy that calls for Israel's death and for America's death every day. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=144.0s)]
*  They have no place in this world, and when it comes to Hamas, they no longer should belong here. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=153.0s)]
*  And the hatred that they've spewed on the Israeli people and the Jewish people is not acceptable to the Prime Minister [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=158.0s)]
*  or to President Trump. We need to always remember that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=164.0s)]
*  So that was the discussion there and also giving us an opportunity to get out of this conflict that we have in Gaza is very important. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=167.0s)]
*  Madam Secretary, I'm sorry because I don't want to go into the private conversation, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=174.0s)]
*  but there is an element of this that has been quite public, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=177.0s)]
*  and the U.S. is negotiating this deal with Iran, trying to get to some resolution, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=181.0s)]
*  but the Israelis have made it very clear that they feel like an attack from Iran [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=187.0s)]
*  or at least them getting the materials for a nuclear weapon is imminent, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=192.0s)]
*  and they plan to attack if that is the case. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=195.0s)]
*  So I don't want you to get into the specifics of the conversation as it relates to the President, the message that you had to deliver, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=198.0s)]
*  but did you see Israel putting this on pause now or are they still have intentions to attack Iran? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=206.0s)]
*  We discussed Iran and we discussed where Israel's position was, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=216.0s)]
*  and I also delivered the message on where the President was, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=221.0s)]
*  and the President will never accept a nuclear capable Iran. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=224.0s)]
*  He will never accept them having nuclear weapons and building the capacity to that. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=227.0s)]
*  The intelligence information that they have and that Israel has and they share with the United States [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=232.0s)]
*  and that we also have and are using for those conversations is critically important. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=237.0s)]
*  So I think the message to the American people is we have a President that wants peace, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=242.0s)]
*  but also a President that will not tolerate a nuclear Iran capability in the future. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=246.0s)]
*  They will not be able to get a nuclear weapon and this President will not allow it, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=254.0s)]
*  but he also wants to be, he wants this Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to be on the same page with him. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=258.0s)]
*  What does Israel want? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=265.0s)]
*  So you talked about this conversation with the Prime Minister. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=267.0s)]
*  What does he want from the Iran deal? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=270.0s)]
*  What did he tell you about what they would like to see accomplished in the deal? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=272.0s)]
*  Well, we talked about the track record with Iran. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=277.0s)]
*  You can't trust them. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=280.0s)]
*  We've got 46 years of proof that you can't trust Iran and Bibi doesn't trust them either. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=282.0s)]
*  I don't blame him one bit. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=287.0s)]
*  His people have been devastated by their horrific violence that they have perpetuated among their people, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=288.0s)]
*  but he also needs America and he knows he needs America [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=294.0s)]
*  and he needs our President to be his ally and to work together. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=297.0s)]
*  We are stronger when we are united and that this is something we will deal with together, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=300.0s)]
*  but this conversation needs to be honest, frank, [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=305.0s)]
*  and we need to go forward recognizing that Iran will never have the capability to produce nuclear weapons. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=307.0s)]
*  Madam Secretary, real quick before I let you go, because there's this debate about the aid coming into Gaza, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=314.0s)]
*  and I get it, and I think the Commander-in-Chief made it very clear. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=320.0s)]
*  He heard from a lot of the folks in the Middle East, [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=324.0s)]
*  some of the kings that he was dealing with, the foreign leaders there, that they want the aid to come through, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=327.0s)]
*  but there's also still the issue of Hamas taking the aid and it's not getting directly to the people. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=332.0s)]
*  So how do we balance wanting to be sympathetic for the cause as it relates to the children that are dying, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=338.0s)]
*  but still you have a terrorist regime that is still in charge? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=345.0s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. It is that aid many times that is funding Hamas. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=351.0s)]
*  So we need to trust. We talked about this specifically with Bibi last night. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=355.0s)]
*  He knows how to get aid into that region to the people who need it without Hamas using it to fund their violence. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=359.0s)]
*  He is bringing aid in. The people are being told to evacuate. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=366.0s)]
*  He is dropping leaflets, letting civilians have the chance to leave before they level these areas that Hamas has infiltrated. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=370.0s)]
*  But if people go in there and offer aid without the kind of intelligence that they are using, they will be fueling more violence. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=376.0s)]
*  They will be fueling more death. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=383.0s)]
*  So this prime minister clearly understands how Hamas has used that age to perpetuate their future, [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=385.0s)]
*  and we need to work with him to ensure that the aid is truly helping the people that need the help to get out of a dangerous situation. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=391.0s)]
*  Well, Secretary Kristi Noem, we appreciate you joining us this morning from Tel Aviv. Safe travels. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=397.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Appreciate it. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=402.0s)]
*  Thank you. Absolutely. Thank you. Thank you so much. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aikEkLeq5ts&t=404.0s)]
