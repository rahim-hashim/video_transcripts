# Non-profit under investigation for alleged ties to terrorism
**Fox News - Middle East:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A)
*  Democratic squad members facing backlash from within their own party over calls to end U.S. support for Israel. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=0.0s)]
*  And now the New York Post reports these progressive lawmakers have received campaign donations from a nonprofit that's under investigation for potentially funding Hamas terrorism. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=8.0s)]
*  Fox Business correspondent Hillary Vaughn joins us live from Capitol Hill. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=20.0s)]
*  What has the intrepid Hillary Vaughn dug up today? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=25.0s)]
*  Hi John. Well that nonprofit that is under investigation for these alleged ties to terrorism, the American Muslims for Palestine, they donated to a lot of these progressive Democrats here on Capitol Hill that have been some of the most outspoken members calling for a ceasefire in this Israel Hamas war. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=28.0s)]
*  The New York Post reports the group gave Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib $500 and another board member gave another thousand dollars to Tlaib and Congresswoman Ilhan Omar received about 50 bucks from the nonprofit but another 1200 from the group's chairman. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=48.0s)]
*  Other small dollar donations from the nonprofit went to other progressives like Congresswomen Cori Bush and Ayanna Pressley. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=64.0s)]
*  That nonprofit is now under investigation by the attorney general in Virginia for allegedly giving money to terrorist organizations. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=70.0s)]
*  The VA attorney general's office announcing this. The attorney general will investigate allegations that the organization may have used funds raised for impermissible purposes under state law including benefiting or providing support to terrorist organizations. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=78.0s)]
*  The nonprofit's attorney denying these allegations outright saying they do not send money overseas and they are focused on educating Americans about the rich history of Palestine saying this in a statement. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=92.0s)]
*  AMP never has and never will support terrorism. No court or government entity has ever held that AMP supports terrorism because there is no evidence to support that allegation because they simply do not do that. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R5ZUXty697A&t=103.0s)]
