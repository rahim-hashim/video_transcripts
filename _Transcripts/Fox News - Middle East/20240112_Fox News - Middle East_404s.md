# Biden's effort to be diplomatic with Iran has failed: Jack Keane
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 12, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk)
*  Back with the Fox News alert, a U.S.-led coalition overnight striking at least 60 [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=0.0s)]
*  targets at 16 different Houthi military sites in Yemen. A retaliatory response to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=4.7s)]
*  the hundred, more than 100 attacks on U.S. forces by the Iran-backed group. All [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=9.58s)]
*  of this comes as our own defense secretary still in the hospital providing [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=14.38s)]
*  this statement on the strike saying this, the coalition action sends a clear [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=18.34s)]
*  message to the Houthis that they will bear further cost if they do not end [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=22.1s)]
*  their illegal attacks. Here to react, Fox News senior strategic analyst, retired [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=25.82s)]
*  four-star general Jack Gein. General, can you describe the quality or the [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=30.18s)]
*  magnitude of this attack? Well, this is the most comprehensive attack that we've [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=36.86s)]
*  conducted since the war in Gaza began. It's really quite significant in [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=42.7s)]
*  terms of what they went after. 60 targets, as you mentioned, 16 locations, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=48.82s)]
*  over a hundred precision-guaranteed munitions delivered by air, surface, and subsurface [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=53.18s)]
*  capabilities. And they went after things that we were talking about, not that [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=58.54s)]
*  they're listening to us, but it was comprehensive. Command and control nodes, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=62.3s)]
*  radar systems, the launch systems themselves, the storage sites for the [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=66.62s)]
*  rockets, missiles, and the drones, and the munitions depots. They're going through [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=71.42s)]
*  bomb damage assessment now to determine how effective this was. They were likely [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=76.9s)]
*  tracking that the Houthis were trying to hide some of this capability for the last [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=82.26s)]
*  few days, but we've got excellent surveillance there, and likely we were [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=86.62s)]
*  able to determine where they were moving a lot of this. Let's finish the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=91.34s)]
*  assessment. Believe me, I think if there's capability there that's still [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=95.34s)]
*  significant, we should re-attack. And then we got to remind ourselves what's [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=99.18s)]
*  really happening here. The center of gravity for the aggression in the Middle [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=104.22s)]
*  East that we're experiencing is Iran. We have said this time and time and time [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=108.18s)]
*  again. And to deter the proxies themselves by hitting them will not be [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=113.38000000000001s)]
*  sufficient. We have got to go after Iran. They are, as I mentioned, the center of [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=119.62s)]
*  gravity. CENTCOM has a table of targets that they have provided to the [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=124.78s)]
*  administration in how to go about doing that comprehensively to shut down their [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=130.86s)]
*  support for these proxies. That has got to be high on our list. And what that [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=135.78s)]
*  really means, Brian, is we've got to reset the strategy in dealing with Iran [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=140.9s)]
*  and the region and admit the fact that this thing has failed. When they came in [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=145.94s)]
*  they removed the trunk sanctions. Iran's flushed with oil money now as a result of [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=150.3s)]
*  it. They went after the nuclear deal. That failed. They were unwilling to [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=155.66s)]
*  confront Iran. They believed that the previous administration's use of the [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=161.26s)]
*  military was too muscular and we had to make a major diplomatic effort. Well, the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=165.7s)]
*  diplomatic effort with Iran has gotten us nowhere. It's shown us weakness. They [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=170.62s)]
*  see it as vulnerability and opportunity and they've taken advantage of it. I don't [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=175.66s)]
*  think the Biden administration has to announce it resetting the failed [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=180.1s)]
*  strategy, but let's just start moving in the right direction with the Arab nations [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=183.01999999999998s)]
*  and Israel to confront Iran. Saudi Arabia, you've always told me, General, has been [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=187.9s)]
*  dealing with for years and not only did they not get any support, the Houthis got [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=193.22s)]
*  removed from the terrorist and the Saudis were told they were a pariah nation. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=197.38s)]
*  Things were backwards. They're not happy because they finally got a [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=201.26s)]
*  ceasefire, it seems, with the Houthis. Now I'm getting this report that the Houthis [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=204.82s)]
*  got a two-hour heads-up that they in the UK, UK reporters put out there two hours [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=208.5s)]
*  before the attack that it was going to take place. How does that affect the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=214.66s)]
*  effectiveness of an operation? I think the Houthis knew for days that an attack [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=218.02s)]
*  was likely. They could see the change in the tenor of the United States public [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=224.3s)]
*  statements and disclosures and they were likely taking taking those actions, but [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=230.5s)]
*  this is this is one of the reasons why we try to conduct these operations in [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=235.34s)]
*  secret and don't have disclosure. After all, we're not we're not conducting an [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=239.94s)]
*  attack against an unprovoked capability here. The Houthis have been attacking us [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=244.3s)]
*  for weeks, so we have every right to attack them and we don't have to go all [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=249.74s)]
*  around the Congress and everybody else giving them notice of this beforehand [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=256.06s)]
*  because there's a likelihood that something could slip out and I think the [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=261.18s)]
*  senior members of the Congress surely understand that. If we were if we were [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=265.22s)]
*  starting a war, that's another matter. That's not what we're doing. We're [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=269.42s)]
*  conducting an attack against a force that's been attacking us. And General, we [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=272.26s)]
*  know this too. That wasn't the only place Iran was at busy. There was an 11 attacks [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=276.82s)]
*  from Hezbollah on Iran and northern Israel and the Islamic resistance in [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=281.74s)]
*  Iraq claimed a rocket attack targeting US forces over in Syria. Yeah, this is [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=286.18s)]
*  still going on obviously. Listen, Hezbollah is attacking into northern [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=294.21999999999997s)]
*  Israel. 80,000 Israelis have been displaced. I know for a fact that the [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=299.08s)]
*  Israeli government is pondering should they take offensive action against [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=304.2s)]
*  Hezbollah in Lebanon? Not defensive action, but should they take aggressive [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=310.0s)]
*  action and expand the war over the 80,000 displaced Israelis? My personal view is I [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  think that would be a mistake. I don't think we should expand that war. Nezraela, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=320.64s)]
*  the head of Hezbollah, is limiting his attacks on northern Israel. He has the [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=325.0s)]
*  capability to attack every town and every city writ large in Israel with [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=330.16s)]
*  over 130,000 rockets and missiles. He's choosing not to do that. I understand the [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=335.48s)]
*  frustration that the Israelis feel about their displaced citizens, but if we end [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=341.32s)]
*  this war in Hamas the way the IDF and the Prime Minister want to do that, that [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=346.36s)]
*  will be a huge step in the right direction. We have got to return to [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=351.96000000000004s)]
*  deterrence in the Middle East. That's a fact, and we can do that with the IDF in [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=356.92s)]
*  Hamas, and we can do it by certainly going, as I mentioned, to the center of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=362.48s)]
*  gravity, which is Iran. Not just with a kinetic attack, which I think is prudent, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=366.44s)]
*  but also with let's double down on the sanctions. Let's get the Arabs and [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=372.32s)]
*  the Israelis together with us and really working out a plan on how to deal with [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=377.20000000000005s)]
*  the Iranians long term. All right, General, thanks so much for scrambling for us and [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=381.04s)]
*  get us the latest information on the attack that took place hours ago. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=384.44s)]
*  Appreciate it. General Jack Keane, thank you. Yeah, great talking to you guys. Have [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=387.24s)]
*  a wonderful weekend. All right. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Riumv_wltqk&t=392.36s)]
