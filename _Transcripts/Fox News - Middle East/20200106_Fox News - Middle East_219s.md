# Tucker: DC insiders push for war with Iran
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 06, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U)
*  But first, if you were in an airport over the weekend, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=0.0s)]
*  you may have seen American troops on the move, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=1.72s)]
*  leaving their families on their way to the Middle East. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=4.0s)]
*  Now, just a month ago, not one in 100 Americans [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=6.76s)]
*  was thinking about Iran. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=9.26s)]
*  Now, suddenly, we are on the brink of war. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=10.68s)]
*  In Washington, that is considered an upgrade, [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=13.34s)]
*  indeed, a massive improvement. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=15.74s)]
*  It's harder to get rich and powerful in Washington [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=17.72s)]
*  during peacetime, so our leaders have a built-in bias for war. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=19.8s)]
*  And so they descended on television studios [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=23.68s)]
*  over the weekend to describe in detail the kind of violence [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  they're prepared to wreak on a country [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=28.24s)]
*  very few of them know anything about. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=30.0s)]
*  Here, for example, is Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=32.04s)]
*  If the Iranians hit American targets [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=36.04s)]
*  and American interests and American allies, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=38.08s)]
*  we will respond militarily. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=40.519999999999996s)]
*  If they hit us again, then I would not want to be working [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=42.44s)]
*  in an Iranian oil field because I think the president [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=47.0s)]
*  is determined to bring this regime to its knees [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=49.480000000000004s)]
*  if they continue to be provocative. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=52.56s)]
*  Meanwhile, the Secretary of State, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Mike Pompeo, assured reporters that the US seeks, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=57.1s)]
*  quote, de-escalation with Iran, and then just moments later, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=59.42s)]
*  suggested the US might bomb dozens of sites [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=63.260000000000005s)]
*  inside Iran itself. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=65.86s)]
*  President Trump is saying that there are 52 sites [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=68.58s)]
*  that the US would target if Iran retaliates. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=71.82000000000001s)]
*  How is that consistent with what you say [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=76.78s)]
*  is your message of de-escalation? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=78.86s)]
*  Entirely consistent. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=80.74000000000001s)]
*  Threatening to bomb mainland Iran? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=82.1s)]
*  The Iranian leadership needs to understand [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=84.54s)]
*  that attacking Americans is not cost free. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=87.06s)]
*  To take a terrorist off the battlefield [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=89.62s)]
*  does not increase the risk of terror. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=91.10000000000001s)]
*  The risk of terror is increased by appeasement. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=93.06s)]
*  The risk of terror is increased by appeasement. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=97.42s)]
*  It's a good line, and it may be true. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=100.34s)]
*  It probably is true. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=102.5s)]
*  Of course, the risk of terror is also increased [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=104.22s)]
*  by bombing other people's countries. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=106.10000000000001s)]
*  That is also indisputably true. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=107.82000000000001s)]
*  It's hard to remember now, but as recently as last week, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=109.98s)]
*  most people didn't consider Iran an imminent threat. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=112.22s)]
*  The Iranian sub tours were not committing acts of terror [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  in our cities. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=117.46000000000001s)]
*  Oh, but our leaders tell us they were about to any second, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=118.66s)]
*  and that's why we struck first. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=120.98s)]
*  What's so striking is how many people [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=123.10000000000001s)]
*  appear to accept this uncritically. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=124.62s)]
*  Just the other day, you remember, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=126.26s)]
*  our intel agencies were considered [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=128.3s)]
*  politically tainted and suspect. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=129.7s)]
*  Certainly on this show they are, were, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=132.22s)]
*  and will be for quite some time. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=134.54s)]
*  Keep in mind, these are the people who invented excuses [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=136.78s)]
*  to spy on the Trump campaign purely because they didn't like [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=139.26s)]
*  Donald Trump's foreign policy views, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=141.74s)]
*  and they're the ones who pretended he was a Russian agent [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=143.7s)]
*  in order to keep him from governing. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=145.54s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=147.06s)]
*  Russiagate? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=147.9s)]
*  Our friends at the intel community did that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=149.18s)]
*  And by the way, these are the same people [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=151.74s)]
*  who lied about Iraq's weapons of mass destruction [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=153.1s)]
*  way back in 2002, and by doing that, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=155.34s)]
*  got us into an utterly pointless war [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=158.42s)]
*  that dramatically weakened our country. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=159.94s)]
*  The people pushing conflict with Iran [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=161.98s)]
*  are the same people who did that. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=164.57999999999998s)]
*  It seems like about 20 minutes ago, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=167.1s)]
*  we were denouncing these very people as the deep state [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=168.54s)]
*  and pledging never to trust them again without verification. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=172.3s)]
*  But now for some reason, we do seem to trust them [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=175.94s)]
*  implicitly and completely. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=179.22s)]
*  In fact, we believe whatever they tell us, [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=180.98000000000002s)]
*  no matter how outlandish. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=183.5s)]
*  Iran did 9-11, they're telling us. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=185.26000000000002s)]
*  Oh, okay, didn't know that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=188.3s)]
*  15 of the 19 hijackers were from Sunni Saudi Arabia, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=190.70000000000002s)]
*  none were from Shiite Iran, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=194.5s)]
*  but if you say so, Mr. unnamed CIA official, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=196.3s)]
*  I'm happy to send my kid to the Middle East [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=199.26000000000002s)]
*  a week after Christmas on the basis [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=200.9s)]
*  of your anonymous, unverified leak to the New York Times. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=202.22s)]
*  You've earned my trust through years of lying to me. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=204.7s)]
*  That appears to be our position now. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=208.1s)]
*  Now, maybe all this will turn out fine in the end. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=210.06s)]
*  We're certainly praying for it. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=212.62s)]
*  We love this country. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=214.3s)]
*  But in the meantime, pardon the skepticism. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ug1oweRu68U&t=215.9s)]
