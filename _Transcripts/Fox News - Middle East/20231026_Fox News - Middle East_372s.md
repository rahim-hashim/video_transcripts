# Lindsey Graham: For Biden to do this now would be INSANE
**Fox News - Middle East:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo)
*  The historic Iran nuclear deal we negotiated blocked Iran from gaining nuclear weapons. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=0.0s)]
*  If Tehran returns to compliance with the deal, I would rejoin the agreement. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=5.84s)]
*  They said we're prepared to reengage in negotiations with the P5-plus-1 on Iran's nuclear program. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=11.56s)]
*  As both a candidate and while in office, President Biden has promised to restore the Obama administration's [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=19.46s)]
*  controversial nuclear agreement with Iran. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=24.44s)]
*  Critics are now pointing out that the 2015 deal, which freed up billions of dollars in Iranian assets, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=26.88s)]
*  allowed Tehran to fund terrorist groups that have destabilized the Middle East. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=33.08s)]
*  Let's bring in South Carolina Republican Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=37.6s)]
*  He just returned from a bipartisan Senate delegation to Israel. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=40.2s)]
*  Senator, I missed you. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=44.08s)]
*  I was on the way out as you were on the way in. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=45.64s)]
*  Sorry about that. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=47.8s)]
*  But good to see that you got to look at what's going on on the ground there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  Let me come back here to the Biden administration and previously the Obama administration. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=52.4s)]
*  They seem to bend over backwards to try to appease Iran. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=56.96s)]
*  And now that is coming back to bite them in a very sensitive spot. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=60.32s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=64.6s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, to reengage Iran now on a nuclear deal would be insane. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  The Biden administration has misjudged the Iranians. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=72.44s)]
*  They're not trying to build a peaceful nuclear program. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=75.68s)]
*  They're trying to build a bomb. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=78.44s)]
*  Trump had him in a corner. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=80.68s)]
*  Trump had him diminished. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=82.36s)]
*  Biden came in and quickly gave them billions of dollars. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=84.16s)]
*  That's increased their ability to kill Israelis and us. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=88.52s)]
*  So it was a bad idea to give the Ayatollah any money. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=92.76s)]
*  The Ayatollah is a religious Nazi. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=95.84s)]
*  He would get a bomb. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=97.64s)]
*  If he had a bomb, he would use it. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=98.92s)]
*  So, Senator, we've got what's going on in Israel and Iran backing Hamas. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=102.44s)]
*  And then there's in Lebanon with Iran backing Hezbollah. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=106.8s)]
*  And then there's what's going on in Syria and in Iraq. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=110.04s)]
*  I want to put up this graphic on the screen here about attacks against American interests [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=113.36000000000001s)]
*  in the region. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=118.76s)]
*  These are being conducted by other Iranian proxies at the Al-Tanf garrison, the Al-Assad [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=120.56s)]
*  air base, the Baghdad International Airport. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=126.16000000000001s)]
*  At least 13 attacks against American interests in the Middle East. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=130.68s)]
*  More than a couple of dozen Americans injured. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=135.16s)]
*  One died from a heart attack running to a bomb shelter. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=138.0s)]
*  And here's what Biden said yesterday with the Australian prime minister to Iran. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=140.84s)]
*  Listen here. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=144.4s)]
*  My warning to the Ayatollah was that if they continue to move against those troops, we [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=145.4s)]
*  will respond. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=151.68s)]
*  And he should be prepared. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=152.68s)]
*  He says that they move, if the Ayatollah moves against the troops, we will respond. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=155.28s)]
*  They've already moved against these troops. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=159.64000000000001s)]
*  Why aren't we responding? [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=161.20000000000002s)]
*  Well, it's just this. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=162.68s)]
*  We've lost deterrence. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=165.0s)]
*  Iraq had Iran afraid of America. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=166.84s)]
*  Now we seem to be afraid of the Iranians. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=169.36s)]
*  Nothing is happening without Iranian support. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=172.16s)]
*  This action by Hamas was to stop the reconciliation process between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=175.08s)]
*  is a nightmare for Iran. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=182.12s)]
*  None of these proxies in Syria, Iraq could survive without Iran. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=184.16s)]
*  So we've lost deterrence. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=188.08s)]
*  Here's what I would do if I were president. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=189.88s)]
*  I would tell the Iranians if there's one more attack on American troops in Syria and Iraq, [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=191.88s)]
*  we're coming after you. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=196.88000000000002s)]
*  If Hezbollah goes into the north to create a second front in Israel, we're coming after [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=198.32000000000002s)]
*  you, starting with your oil fields. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=203.20000000000002s)]
*  If they believed that, they would not do this. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=205.28s)]
*  So at the same time, now we've got reporting in the Wall Street Journal from yesterday [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=208.72s)]
*  that some 500 Hamas terrorists were in Iran and also Palestinian Islamic Jihad training [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=214.16000000000003s)]
*  with the Al-Quds force, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=222.26s)]
*  Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari of the IDF said in the article in the Wall Street Journal [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=227.06s)]
*  quote, before the war, Iran directly assisted Hamas with money, training, and weapons and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=231.38s)]
*  technological know-how. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=236.17999999999998s)]
*  Even now, Iran is helping Hamas with intelligence. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=238.1s)]
*  Yet President Biden continues to say, oh, well, there's no direct link between Iran [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=241.22s)]
*  and what happened on October the 7th. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=245.57999999999998s)]
*  What do you say? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=247.26s)]
*  This is laughable to believe that Hamas planned this for a year, maybe two, three thousand [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=248.94s)]
*  people involved and Iran didn't know about it. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=255.02s)]
*  That's laughable to me. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=257.82s)]
*  The hoodies have shot missiles at Israel. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=259.3s)]
*  I know Iran's behind that. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=263.3s)]
*  So the idea that Hamas did this without the Ayatollah knowing it or he read about it in [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=265.46s)]
*  the paper, saw it on TV, is laughable. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=271.3s)]
*  The great Satan in the world is Iran. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=274.54s)]
*  It's not Israel, it's not the United States. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=277.18s)]
*  We've lost deterrence against the Iranians. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=279.66s)]
*  I am supporting President Biden the best I can. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  But you need to make it clear, Mr. President, that Iran is going to be a target by the U.S. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=285.38s)]
*  military if they escalate in Israel or continue to attack our troops. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=292.1s)]
*  We will be behind you, Mr. President, if you will do that. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=296.76s)]
*  Jews in the field in Syria and Iraq deserve a commander in chief who has their back. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=300.1s)]
*  President Biden, up your game when it comes to deterring Iran before it's too late. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=305.18s)]
*  Senator, one quick question if I could on Jack Lew, the president's nominee to be the [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=309.66s)]
*  U.S. ambassador to Israel. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=313.38s)]
*  He was voted out of committee. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=314.74s)]
*  He'll go to a full vote in the Senate. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=315.74s)]
*  Israel says we need to have an American ambassador there. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=318.78000000000003s)]
*  The U.S. believes the same thing. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  Where do you come down on him? [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=322.5s)]
*  Well, we need an ambassador to Israel and I've known Mr. Lew for a while. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=323.98s)]
*  I'm thinking about it, but at the end of the day, we do need an ambassador and I can understand [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=328.46000000000004s)]
*  some of the problems with Mr. Lew. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  But I'll get back with you about that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=334.58000000000004s)]
*  But I just got back from Israel. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=336.38s)]
*  They're in the fight for their lives. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=338.90000000000003s)]
*  Hamas is a religious Nazis. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=340.70000000000005s)]
*  They're not trying to get a better deal for the Palestinians. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=342.94s)]
*  They're trying to kill all the Jews. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=345.14s)]
*  And Iran is a religious theocracy that has to be dealt with through force and deterrence, [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  not appeasement. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=353.1s)]
*  We've appeased Iran too long. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=354.1s)]
*  All right. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=356.06s)]
*  Senator Lindsey Graham of the great state of South Carolina. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gumwXo-ZwPo&t=357.06s)]
