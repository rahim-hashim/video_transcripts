# Gutfeld: Trump is sending a clear message that he means what he says
**Fox News - Middle East:** [January 05, 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8)
*  Well, if there's one thing we've learned in three years, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=0.0s)]
*  is that Trump will always respond. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=3.72s)]
*  You ask a dumb question, Trump's gonna respond. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=6.08s)]
*  You're with CNN and your fake news. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=9.52s)]
*  The fake news, which is you and you. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=11.52s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=13.84s)]
*  Impeachment testimony, Trump's gonna respond. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=14.96s)]
*  I want nothing. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=18.52s)]
*  I want nothing. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=19.88s)]
*  I want no quid pro quo. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=21.96s)]
*  Storm our embassy in Iraq? [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=24.400000000000002s)]
*  Boy, will Trump respond. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=26.6s)]
*  US military confirming it carried out a strike [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=29.54s)]
*  near Baghdad airport, killing Qassem Soleimani. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=32.78s)]
*  The Defense Department tonight has confirmed [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=35.78s)]
*  that the United States has killed [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=38.379999999999995s)]
*  Iranian General Qassem Soleimani. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=39.739999999999995s)]
*  A rocket attack on the Baghdad airport [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  kills Iran's most revered military leader. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=44.7s)]
*  Most revered. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=48.739999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, a US drone took out the guy who helped direct wars [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=51.3s)]
*  in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and Lebanon. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=54.9s)]
*  A guy whose efforts led to the deaths [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=57.58s)]
*  of hundreds of Americans in Iraq. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=59.38s)]
*  He was a bad guy doing really bad things [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=61.66s)]
*  for a really long time. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=63.66s)]
*  So is it bad to kill a bad guy? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=65.38s)]
*  No one should be shedding any tears for Qassem Soleimani. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=68.7s)]
*  He was in fact responsible for, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=70.78s)]
*  he had American blood on his hands. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=74.28s)]
*  But at the same time, I think the fact, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=76.18s)]
*  as Ambassador Sherman said, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=79.53999999999999s)]
*  that the consequences of this could be unbelievable. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=81.74s)]
*  Qassem Soleimani is a ruthless, ruthless killer. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=85.10000000000001s)]
*  There is no doubt about that. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=89.10000000000001s)]
*  Nobody weeps that he is gone. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=90.66s)]
*  But that said, the Obama administration, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=93.14s)]
*  at least to my knowledge, did not go after him [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=96.22s)]
*  and target him because we understood [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=99.98s)]
*  what the consequences were. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=102.34s)]
*  Everything comes with a butt. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=104.5s)]
*  Oh, terrible, terrible guy, terrible guy, terrible guy. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=106.82000000000001s)]
*  Butts, butts, butts. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=110.14s)]
*  And consequences? [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=113.66s)]
*  Look, Iran already doesn't like us, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=117.26s)]
*  hasn't liked us for decades. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=120.3s)]
*  Iran's been not liking us way before Trump [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=122.1s)]
*  was elected president. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=124.82s)]
*  Hell, it's been not liking us way before [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=125.94s)]
*  the Trump Tower was even built. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=128.14s)]
*  But taking out a bad guy is bad because Trump. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=130.46s)]
*  What I think is going on here, frankly, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=135.62s)]
*  is that this action was taken more [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=138.54s)]
*  in President Trump's self-interest [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=141.1s)]
*  rather than our national interest. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=143.18s)]
*  Still a charmer. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=146.9s)]
*  Self-interest. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=149.3s)]
*  Okay, Trump ran a campaign on avoiding quagmires [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=151.06s)]
*  and his supporters had their fill [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=154.74s)]
*  with Iraq, Libya, and Syria. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=156.86s)]
*  So this action seems the opposite of self-interest. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=158.74s)]
*  It's a country's interest, our country. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=162.58s)]
*  If you ask me, Trump took action to stop a war, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=165.66s)]
*  not start one. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=168.38s)]
*  We took action last night to stop a war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=170.33999999999997s)]
*  We did not take action to start a war. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=175.26s)]
*  See? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=180.45999999999998s)]
*  I love being right. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=185.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=188.57999999999998s)]
*  My first prediction of the year is 100% on. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=191.06s)]
*  So he's sending a clear message [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=195.01999999999998s)]
*  that Trump means what he says, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=196.61999999999998s)]
*  that it's never a good idea to stake out your army [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=198.06s)]
*  in another country and plan attacks against the US [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=200.78s)]
*  and think that you're gonna get away with it. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=203.9s)]
*  Not while he's president, at least. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=206.54s)]
*  But thank God the media is focusing [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=208.94s)]
*  on the stuff that matters. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=210.58s)]
*  Over at CNN, what was their best headline? [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=212.5s)]
*  President Trump dined on ice cream [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=216.46s)]
*  as news of the airstrike broke. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=219.62s)]
*  As if Trump indulging in a sweetened dairy product [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=224.58s)]
*  makes the strike that much worse. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=227.66s)]
*  Not for me, CNN. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=232.94s)]
*  It actually makes it that much better. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=235.26s)]
*  I mean, wouldn't you, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=238.74s)]
*  wouldn't you want your president to be eating ice cream [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=244.14s)]
*  while he eliminates a mass murderer? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=247.38s)]
*  I do. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=252.06s)]
*  I'd say that's pretty cool. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=254.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, the experts on all the networks say, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=256.34s)]
*  we are one step closer to war, which raises the question, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=258.82s)]
*  who exactly is an expert on Iran, Iraq, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=262.02s)]
*  or the Middle East in general? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=265.73999999999995s)]
*  Where is their proof of success [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=267.14s)]
*  beyond feverish appearances on cable news shows? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=268.53999999999996s)]
*  No one has ever gotten that region right, ever. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=272.17999999999995s)]
*  And anyone who sees the killing of a murderous general [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=275.53999999999996s)]
*  as worse than sending pallets of money [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=278.14s)]
*  to that general's country can be no expert. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=280.34s)]
*  He can be a moron. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=283.05999999999995s)]
*  Now, one other expert warned [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=285.58000000000004s)]
*  that this wasn't just any old killing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=288.02000000000004s)]
*  True, this wasn't just some ISIS fighter. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=290.5s)]
*  It was a top general, [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=293.06s)]
*  a powerful leader of an adversarial government. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=294.3s)]
*  So hooray. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=297.54s)]
*  I mean, really, isn't the killing of old generals by drone [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=299.18s)]
*  preferable to sending waves of young men and women [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=303.34000000000003s)]
*  to their deaths on a battlefield? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=306.14000000000004s)]
*  So maybe this doesn't mean war at all. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=308.1s)]
*  War is when the old generals send young people to die. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=310.5s)]
*  Under Trump, we just kill those old generals. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  With. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=317.70000000000005s)]
*  With. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=319.66s)]
*  And this is my favorite part, as you know. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=322.1s)]
*  He did it with a flying robot. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=324.38s)]
*  That's progress. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVPFpavmPA8&t=327.74s)]
